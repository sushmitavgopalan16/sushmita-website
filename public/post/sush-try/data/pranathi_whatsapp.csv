454,"18/12/17, 8:59:37 PM",Sush, I fell back asleeeep
455,"18/12/17, 9:01:19 PM",Pranathi, Eating dinner! I'll call in just a bit? 
456,"18/12/17, 9:05:19 PM",Sush, 👍🏽💅🏾🐳
457,"19/12/17, 12:10:48 AM",Sush, I'm feeling weird about this mikhail thing also!
458,"19/12/17, 12:10:59 AM",Sush, It was such an unsatisfactory conversation
459,"19/12/17, 12:11:35 AM",Pranathi, Oh no! 
460,"19/12/17, 12:11:41 AM",Pranathi, Unsatisfactory in what sense?
461,"19/12/17, 12:12:04 AM",Sush, Like the gist of it was 'he's not that into you'
462,"19/12/17, 12:12:14 AM",Sush, And he's 100x into Valentina
463,"19/12/17, 12:12:18 AM",Sush, She has WRINKLES
464,"19/12/17, 12:12:24 AM",Sush, shows my biases Akron
465,"19/12/17, 12:12:27 AM",Sush, *also
466,"19/12/17, 12:12:35 AM",Sush, That it puzzles me
467,"19/12/17, 12:13:13 AM",Sush, I have increasing fear that no one ever will want me
468,"19/12/17, 12:13:24 AM",Sush, Fundamentally unloveable
469,"19/12/17, 12:13:40 AM",Pranathi, You are not unloveable. That is one hundred percent untrue
470,"19/12/17, 12:14:12 AM",Pranathi, You are absolutely lovely and charming and interesting and just because one dude decided not to date you anymore is NO reflection on you
471,"19/12/17, 12:14:21 AM",Pranathi, And you know that too
472,"19/12/17, 12:14:38 AM",Sush, But it's also true that people are just not into me
473,"19/12/17, 12:14:55 AM",Pranathi, Plus the fundamental incompatibility wasn't with you or anything about you. It was that you didn't want poly
474,"19/12/17, 12:15:11 AM",Sush, It was me only
475,"19/12/17, 12:15:13 AM",Pranathi, Which is completely within your rights to reject
476,"19/12/17, 12:15:18 AM",Sush, I told him admit you're not poly
477,"19/12/17, 12:15:29 AM",Sush," He said yes maybe you're right, I was unable to choose"
478,"19/12/17, 12:15:39 AM",Sush, And was too selfish and lazy to force myself to choose
479,"19/12/17, 12:15:52 AM",Sush, So he chose her
480,"19/12/17, 12:15:55 AM",Pranathi, Dude do you realize what a piece of scum that makes him?
481,"19/12/17, 12:16:00 AM",Sush, That's basically what happened
482,"19/12/17, 12:16:10 AM",Sush, Like he said that in hindsight
483,"19/12/17, 12:16:14 AM",Pranathi, Instead of being angry at him you're upset that you're unloveable
484,"19/12/17, 12:16:41 AM",Pranathi, But still. That's fucked up
485,"19/12/17, 12:17:02 AM",Pranathi, To have played around with your emotions and assured you that it was all fine
486,"19/12/17, 12:17:05 AM",Pranathi, It enrages me
487,"19/12/17, 12:17:14 AM",Pranathi, You are absolutely loveable dude
488,"19/12/17, 12:17:22 AM",Sush, But he doesn't think so
489,"19/12/17, 12:17:32 AM",Sush, He chose someone 5000 miles away over me
490,"19/12/17, 12:17:34 AM",Sush, An Aunty
491,"19/12/17, 12:17:37 AM",Sush, With wrinkles
492,"19/12/17, 12:17:43 AM",Sush, Wtf is wrong with her
493,"19/12/17, 12:17:46 AM",Pranathi, So what? He's some dumbass child who's choosing instead to be in a relationship with someone there's no future with
494,"19/12/17, 12:17:49 AM",Sush, Carrying on this dalliance
495,"19/12/17, 12:17:49 AM",Pranathi, Because he's got issues
496,"19/12/17, 12:18:01 AM",Sush, Yeah 
497,"19/12/17, 12:18:00 AM",Pranathi, And you've told me that yourself
498,"19/12/17, 12:18:07 AM",Sush, But no one is going to want me
499,"19/12/17, 12:18:19 AM",Sush, I'm not hideous or grumpy or mean
500,"19/12/17, 12:18:20 AM",Sush, Why?!
501,"19/12/17, 12:18:20 AM",Pranathi, That's patently untrue and you know that.
502,"19/12/17, 12:18:41 AM",Pranathi," Exactly. You're not any of those things. And even if you were, people like that find love"
503,"19/12/17, 12:18:50 AM",Sush, 
504,"19/12/17, 12:18:53 AM",Pranathi, There's no type of person who's inherently loveable
505,"19/12/17, 12:19:01 AM",Pranathi, I refuse to believe that that's true
506,"19/12/17, 12:19:03 AM",Sush, My heart has been beating fast again since yesterday
507,"19/12/17, 12:19:06 AM",Pranathi, It just isn't
508,"19/12/17, 12:19:21 AM",Pranathi, God I'm so fucking mad at him for contacting you again
509,"19/12/17, 12:19:38 AM",Pranathi, He had nothing to lose but didn't consider where you might be
510,"19/12/17, 12:19:42 AM",Pranathi, Bastard
511,"[19/12/17, 12:19:44 AM",Sush, ‎image omitted
512,"19/12/17, 12:20:01 AM",Sush, It's just like when he wanted to get back together with me
513,"19/12/17, 12:20:09 AM",Sush, He saw he wanted he had to have that's all
514,"19/12/17, 12:20:14 AM",Pranathi, Lol Rodrigo. Cuteeeee
515,"19/12/17, 12:20:22 AM",Sush, Isn't he the best 😍😂
516,"19/12/17, 12:20:57 AM",Pranathi, How can you say that and let yourself feel unloveable at the same time?
517,"19/12/17, 12:21:06 AM",Sush," Rodrigo on Valentina ""But her is more crazy. But she is a PhD in physics. Maybe she has never loved"""
518,"19/12/17, 12:21:14 AM",Pranathi, Hahahahaha
519,"19/12/17, 12:21:26 AM",Pranathi, What does that mean!
520,"19/12/17, 12:21:43 AM",Sush, He thinks physics junta are crazy and are friends with the stars
521,"19/12/17, 12:22:45 AM",Sush, Because of that Dimitris
522,"19/12/17, 12:22:59 AM",Sush, Because ultimately he chose her
523,"19/12/17, 12:23:15 AM",Pranathi," Dude you're a goddamn QUEEN. You're crushing your course. You're a baller lady coder. You are extensively read, you're beautiful, you're funny. You don't need some dumbass child to tell you these things"
524,"19/12/17, 12:23:33 AM",Sush, You're biased because you love me!!!
525,"19/12/17, 12:23:48 AM",Pranathi, I will tell you and for now that has to be enough. It definitely doesn't mean you won't hear it from some dumb man in the near future
526,"19/12/17, 12:23:58 AM",Pranathi, Haha why do you think I love you idiot?
527,"19/12/17, 12:24:00 AM",Sush, ❤️
528,"19/12/17, 12:24:02 AM",Pranathi, Because you're awesome
529,"19/12/17, 12:24:10 AM",Pranathi, I don't just randomly love everyone no?
530,"19/12/17, 12:24:19 AM",Sush, Fair 🐳❤️
531,"19/12/17, 12:24:31 AM",Sush, I feel hurt in a sort of removed way
532,"19/12/17, 12:24:39 AM",Sush, It doesn't feel crushing like it did earlier
533,"19/12/17, 12:24:42 AM",Pranathi, Yeah the hurt I completely understand
534,"19/12/17, 12:24:50 AM",Sush, It's mostly a fear of what if I never love
535,"19/12/17, 12:25:01 AM",Pranathi, I still feel remotely in pain every time I think of Nick
536,"19/12/17, 12:25:10 AM",Sush, I can totally imagine!
537,"19/12/17, 12:25:23 AM",Pranathi, And I thought of him a lot in the two hours at immigration because that was the last time I was in line there
538,"19/12/17, 12:25:28 AM",Sush, and you guys were together so long
539,"19/12/17, 12:25:35 AM",Pranathi, When I was waiting to get to HP for him to break up with me again
540,"19/12/17, 12:25:42 AM",Sush, Oh man 
541,"19/12/17, 12:25:45 AM",Pranathi, I'm just going to have to deal with it
542,"19/12/17, 12:25:52 AM",Pranathi, But it's better than it used to be
543,"19/12/17, 12:25:54 AM",Sush, Fucking Nick
544,"19/12/17, 12:25:59 AM",Pranathi, And it'll be better for you too
545,"19/12/17, 12:26:03 AM",Sush, Nick the Dick
546,"19/12/17, 12:26:24 AM",Sush, Sorry it sounded very angry in my head!!
547,"19/12/17, 12:26:36 AM",Sush, It looks frivolous in text
548,"19/12/17, 12:26:52 AM",Pranathi, Can't say when but maybe one day we'll stop feeling this constant sense of dull pain
549,"19/12/17, 12:27:05 AM",Sush, Ya I can't wait for it to stop
550,"19/12/17, 12:27:07 AM",Pranathi, With Suraj now I feel amusement more than anything
551,"19/12/17, 12:27:12 AM",Sush, Fair!
552,"19/12/17, 12:27:13 AM",Pranathi, Haha not at all frivolous
553,"19/12/17, 12:27:20 AM",Pranathi, Nick the Dick
554,"19/12/17, 12:27:21 AM",Sush, With Siddharth I just feel a sense of wasted time
555,"19/12/17, 12:27:30 AM",Sush, Wasted youth
556,"19/12/17, 12:27:48 AM",Pranathi, Mikhail the Dick-ail?

561,"19/12/17, 12:28:27 AM",Pranathi, The only one who commented recently on my face recently was Polly lol
562,"19/12/17, 12:28:28 AM",Sush," Btw, your picture is da bomb yo! 🔥 In my opinion"

571,"19/12/17, 12:29:13 AM",Pranathi, Sorry 🙈
572,"19/12/17, 12:29:24 AM",Sush, Took it off my phone for a bit

605,"19/12/17, 12:33:57 AM",Pranathi, Dude I did a very vekkamless thing today
606,"19/12/17, 12:34:15 AM",Pranathi, I was walking back home and I saw some boy outside Medici I have seen around all the time
607,"19/12/17, 12:34:21 AM",Sush, Oooh
608,"19/12/17, 12:34:24 AM",Pranathi, I don't know what came over me
609,"19/12/17, 12:34:32 AM",Pranathi, I saw him smoking and I asked for one
610,"19/12/17, 12:34:41 AM",Pranathi, Didn't even really want it but it was a great conversation starter
611,"19/12/17, 12:34:47 AM",Sush, 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
612,"19/12/17, 12:34:47 AM",Pranathi, And then he asked for my number
613,"19/12/17, 12:34:51 AM",Sush, Ayyyy
614,"19/12/17, 12:34:57 AM",Pranathi, Dude he works at Medici hahahaha

618,"19/12/17, 12:35:14 AM",Sush, Hmm can't recall!
619,"19/12/17, 12:35:14 AM",Pranathi, You know who I'm talking about?
620,"19/12/17, 12:35:24 AM",Pranathi, If you see him you'll immediately know
621,"19/12/17, 12:35:30 AM",Sush, I suppose!
622,"19/12/17, 12:35:34 AM",Pranathi, But he was UChicago undergrad and now does market research
623,"19/12/17, 12:35:46 AM",Pranathi, But also works for a think tank in Delhi
624,"19/12/17, 12:35:50 AM",Sush, Oh wow

628,"19/12/17, 12:36:21 AM",Pranathi, I am feeling very terrified for myself
629,"19/12/17, 12:36:25 AM",Sush, No that's very good
630,"19/12/17, 12:36:25 AM",Pranathi, Unnecessary
631,"19/12/17, 12:36:51 AM",Pranathi, Yes ah? Not desperate?
632,"19/12/17, 12:40:00 AM",Sush, No no
633,"19/12/17, 12:40:02 AM",Sush, Not at all
634,"19/12/17, 12:47:42 AM",Pranathi, Okay just reporting updates to you haha
635,"19/12/17, 12:47:48 AM",Pranathi, Okay I shall sleep off now
636,"19/12/17, 12:47:53 AM",Pranathi, Must wake up and write in the morning
637,"19/12/17, 1:10:56 AM",Sush, Enjoyyyy❤️
638,"19/12/17, 1:11:14 AM",Pranathi, I really want to text Andrew and ask him why he didn't reply to me
639,"19/12/17, 1:11:21 AM",Sush, No!!!
640,"19/12/17, 1:11:24 AM",Sush, Delete number
641,"19/12/17, 1:11:31 AM",Pranathi, But I just want for closure
642,"19/12/17, 1:11:33 AM",Sush, His non response is response enough
643,"19/12/17, 1:11:34 AM",Pranathi, Not to rekindle
644,"19/12/17, 1:11:37 AM",Pranathi, It's driving me insane
645,"19/12/17, 1:11:49 AM",Pranathi, 
646,"19/12/17, 1:12:02 AM",Sush, What will make you feel better to hear?
647,"19/12/17, 1:12:30 AM",Pranathi, I worry that he thinks I was too hasty and didn't give him a chance to even engage
648,"19/12/17, 1:12:37 AM",Pranathi, Like I just said bye
649,"19/12/17, 1:12:46 AM",Pranathi, Instead of raising the concern and waiting for a response
650,"19/12/17, 1:12:46 AM",Sush, You literally have him 100 chances
651,"19/12/17, 1:12:56 AM",Sush, You raised the concern multiple times
652,"19/12/17, 1:13:15 AM",Sush, And he could have responded to bye if he had wanted to
653,"19/12/17, 1:13:27 AM",Pranathi, I guess I just want to rage at him lol
654,"19/12/17, 1:13:49 AM",Pranathi, And ask him how the fuck he could disrespect someone so much that he wouldn't even respond
655,"19/12/17, 1:13:59 AM",Sush, I know 
656,"19/12/17, 1:14:10 AM",Sush, It's really this new modality of dating
657,"19/12/17, 1:14:14 AM",Sush, Zero accountability
658,"19/12/17, 1:14:32 AM",Pranathi, But by texting him that don't I get it off my chest?
659,"19/12/17, 1:14:39 AM",Pranathi, And then have nothing to lose anyway
660,"19/12/17, 1:14:51 AM",Pranathi, Like he thinks I'm clingy already
661,"19/12/17, 1:14:53 AM",Sush, You're going to wait all over again for him to respond
662,"19/12/17, 1:15:00 AM",Sush, Why open it up again?
663,"19/12/17, 1:15:11 AM",Pranathi, Yeah but what if he does
664,"19/12/17, 1:15:20 AM",Pranathi, Then maybe I'll feel better about this whole thing
665,"19/12/17, 1:15:27 AM",Pranathi, I'm still thinking about him anyway 
666,"19/12/17, 1:15:29 AM",Pranathi, I'm so lame
667,"19/12/17, 1:16:15 AM",Sush, I just think there's nothing to be gained no?
668,"19/12/17, 1:16:27 AM",Pranathi, Yeah you're right 
669,"19/12/17, 1:16:52 AM",Pranathi, I just wish at least one of these idiots I've been involved with would show some modicum of remorse
670,"19/12/17, 1:17:14 AM",Pranathi, I think I am struggling with lack of closure on so many fronts
671,"19/12/17, 1:17:24 AM",Sush, I'm sure Nick feels like shit
672,"19/12/17, 1:17:36 AM",Sush, But is waaayyyy to egotistic to say so
673,"19/12/17, 1:18:09 AM",Pranathi, I don't think he does feel like shit. He's probably constructed some story in his head where I've deserved this
674,"19/12/17, 1:18:29 AM",Sush, I can't get rid of that rooster image
675,"19/12/17, 1:19:03 AM",Sush, He's in some wolf of Wall Street type trip no
676,"19/12/17, 1:19:29 AM",Pranathi, Yeah he is
677,"19/12/17, 1:19:49 AM",Pranathi, He loves some movie about some young trader who makes it big
678,"19/12/17, 1:19:56 AM",Pranathi, Like that's his favorite movie
679,"19/12/17, 1:20:19 AM",Sush, Ughhh
680,"19/12/17, 1:20:25 AM",Sush, I'm all for being ambitious
681,"19/12/17, 1:20:31 AM",Sush, But that's kind of vulgar
682,"19/12/17, 1:20:38 AM",Pranathi, Right?
683,"19/12/17, 1:20:41 AM",Pranathi, Anyway
684,"19/12/17, 1:20:50 AM",Pranathi, I think I was going down a thought spiral with this Andrew
685,"19/12/17, 1:20:55 AM",Pranathi, Thanks for pulling me out of it
686,"19/12/17, 1:21:03 AM",Sush, 'Halt!'

695,"19/12/17, 1:21:53 AM",Pranathi, But it's so true
696,"19/12/17, 1:22:00 AM",Pranathi, All the time I am feeling these days
697,"19/12/17, 1:22:07 AM",Sush, It is true
698,"19/12/17, 1:22:11 AM",Pranathi, I think because I was around all these happily married annoying as fuck people
699,"19/12/17, 1:22:18 AM",Sush, We're all so fundamentally alone
700,"19/12/17, 1:44:05 AM",Pranathi, Yeah we are

731,"19/12/17, 11:26:45 PM",Pranathi," I woke up SO late, around noon."
732,"19/12/17, 11:26:56 PM",Pranathi, But I don't feel too bad about that considering jet lag and that I was up so late last night
733,"19/12/17, 11:27:04 PM",Pranathi, But it did feel like half my day was gone
734,"19/12/17, 11:27:08 PM",Sush, Yeah you were up till dawn almost!
735,"19/12/17, 11:27:43 PM",Sush, Do you have to work on your qualifying paper

737,"19/12/17, 11:29:51 PM",Pranathi, But I think it's okay if I take an extra week to do it even after the quarter starts.
738,"19/12/17, 11:30:22 PM",Pranathi," I would ideally like to be done with it before the quarter, but I'd also like to just be more realistic and enjoy NY without feeling super guilty for no reason"
739,"19/12/17, 11:30:31 PM",Pranathi, I'm meeting Marco on Thursday anyway so I'll talk about it then with him
740,"19/12/17, 11:30:49 PM",Pranathi, I just ended up hanging out in the lounge with Sneha and Austin and we shot (?) the shit for nearly five hours
741,"19/12/17, 11:30:59 PM",Pranathi, Then I came home and ordered pizza and am just finishing laundry
742,"19/12/17, 11:31:12 PM",Pranathi," I felt slightly guilty about ordering pizza also, but it was Domino's! So good"
743,"19/12/17, 11:36:14 PM",Sush, Haha! That sounds like a fun day!

1238,"27/12/17, 10:13:37 PM",Sush, did he seem nice and safe?
1239,"27/12/17, 10:13:50 PM",Pranathi, Yeah he was UChicago undergrad
1240,"27/12/17, 10:13:55 PM",Pranathi, Not that that makes him safe or nice
1241,"27/12/17, 10:14:00 PM",Pranathi, But he seemed okay only
1242,"27/12/17, 10:14:03 PM",Sush, lolol
1243,"27/12/17, 10:14:06 PM",Pranathi, But after what that Oliver told me
1244,"27/12/17, 10:14:14 PM",Pranathi, I am feeling sexually underconfident
1245,"27/12/17, 10:14:31 PM",Pranathi, Also I feel somewhat like I'm betraying Ajooni. Not like we're dating or anything but still
1246,"27/12/17, 10:14:40 PM",Sush, nooo you'll get your mojo once you're there if you're into it
1247,"27/12/17, 10:14:46 PM",Sush, oh hahaha
1248,"27/12/17, 10:14:49 PM",Pranathi, But even this Ajooni thing I dunno if I made a big deal of it in my head
1249,"27/12/17, 10:14:52 PM",Sush, do you _want_ to go?
1250,"27/12/17, 10:15:03 PM",Pranathi," But with her not around, it feels very distant"
1251,"27/12/17, 10:15:23 PM",Pranathi, I think so? But lots of conflicted feelings.
1252,"27/12/17, 10:15:35 PM",Pranathi, I think I am very confused in life right now.
1253,"27/12/17, 10:15:49 PM",Sush, fair enough!
1254,"27/12/17, 10:15:50 PM",Pranathi, I think I have become very very afraid of getting burnt
1255,"27/12/17, 10:16:10 PM",Sush, odds of getting burnt by random dude are pretty low?
1256,"27/12/17, 10:17:31 PM",Pranathi, Yeah true
1257,"27/12/17, 10:17:35 PM",Pranathi, I don't know let's see
1258,"27/12/17, 10:17:52 PM",Pranathi, We were talking about sex things though and he said he likes it to be hairless down there
1259,"27/12/17, 10:17:58 PM",Pranathi, Which I thought was a bad sign?
1260,"27/12/17, 10:18:04 PM",Pranathi, That he felt like he could ask that already
1261,"27/12/17, 10:18:12 PM",Pranathi, Or even make that a priority
1262,"27/12/17, 10:18:16 PM",Pranathi, Sorry this is TMI 
1263,"27/12/17, 10:18:33 PM",Sush, hahahaa
1264,"27/12/17, 10:18:48 PM",Sush, if it's going to be a 1 time thing doesn't matter
1265,"27/12/17, 10:21:40 PM",Pranathi, Yeah but I also don't want to shave down there just for some random hookup
1266,"27/12/17, 10:21:50 PM",Pranathi, Like I would have to get into the shower now and shave my legs and pubic hair
1267,"27/12/17, 10:21:56 PM",Pranathi, Which feels like a lot of effort for a hookup
1268,"27/12/17, 10:23:45 PM",Sush, Correct
1269,"27/12/17, 10:23:53 PM",Sush, Abba painful
1270,"27/12/17, 10:24:02 PM",Pranathi, So I decided I'll just meet him at Jimmy's
1271,"27/12/17, 10:24:05 PM",Pranathi, Low key hang
1272,"27/12/17, 10:24:09 PM",Pranathi, No need for sex now
1273,"27/12/17, 10:24:12 PM",Pranathi, I'm not totally sure
1274,"27/12/17, 10:24:13 PM",Sush, Smart
1275,"27/12/17, 10:24:17 PM",Pranathi, That I want to have sex with him
1276,"27/12/17, 10:24:23 PM",Sush, Good call
1277,"27/12/17, 10:24:24 PM",Pranathi, He has a mustache
1278,"27/12/17, 10:24:35 PM",Sush, Hahaha is that a turn off for you
1279,"27/12/17, 10:24:40 PM",Sush, 😂
1280,"27/12/17, 10:24:51 PM",Pranathi, When I say he has a mustache
1281,"27/12/17, 10:24:58 PM",Pranathi, He has like one of those Rajasthani level mustaches
1282,"27/12/17, 10:25:05 PM",Sush, That's awesome 😂
1283,"27/12/17, 10:25:14 PM",Sush, Like shikhar Dhawan?
1284,"27/12/17, 10:25:22 PM",Pranathi, Yeah exactly like that!
1285,"27/12/17, 10:25:29 PM",Pranathi, He was inspired when he went to Rajasthan it seems
1286,"27/12/17, 10:25:31 PM",Sush, Very trendy 😅😅😅
1287,"27/12/17, 10:25:35 PM",Sush, Lolol
1288,"27/12/17, 10:25:38 PM",Sush, Omg
1289,"27/12/17, 10:25:51 PM",Pranathi, See why I'm hesitant HA?
1290,"27/12/17, 10:26:34 PM",Sush, 😂😂😂
1291,"27/12/17, 10:26:39 PM",Sush, Jimmy's is a good idea
1292,"27/12/17, 10:26:48 PM",Pranathi, Yeah. 
1293,"27/12/17, 10:27:00 PM",Sush, also so cold I imagine
1294,"27/12/17, 10:27:18 PM",Sush, I feel like my coat won't suffice
1295,"27/12/17, 10:27:21 PM",Sush, #sigh
1296,"27/12/17, 10:28:37 PM",Pranathi, Yeah I think you'll have to get a heavier coat. My coat feels too light and it's probably on the thicker end
1297,"27/12/17, 11:15:27 PM",Sush, Ugh gross
1298,"28/12/17, 11:58:32 AM",Sush, Pranathi!
1299,"28/12/17, 11:58:38 AM",Sush, I have a question
1300,"28/12/17, 11:59:05 AM",Pranathi, Yes ask off!
1301,"28/12/17, 11:59:14 AM",Sush, I haaaaaaate my house
1302,"28/12/17, 11:59:23 AM",Sush, And Sneha hasn't found a subletter
1303,"28/12/17, 11:59:56 AM",Sush, Do you think it would be out of line to ask her to give it to me at half rent until spring after which I can pay her the regular sublet rent
1304,"28/12/17, 12:00:13 PM",Sush, She's also been saying she can't bring herself to hunt for a renter
1305,"28/12/17, 12:00:30 PM",Sush, Because I'd have to pay rent for both houses for Feb and march otherwise
1306,"28/12/17, 12:00:36 PM",Sush, Which I obv can't afford
1307,"28/12/17, 12:01:05 PM",Sush, Means I'll suggest only
1308,"28/12/17, 12:01:13 PM",Sush, She can easily say no
1309,"28/12/17, 12:04:12 PM",Sush, Tell toooo
1310,"28/12/17, 12:04:27 PM",Pranathi, Sorry I'm at these family friends' house
1311,"28/12/17, 12:04:32 PM",Pranathi," Just one sec, so sorry!"
1312,"28/12/17, 12:05:05 PM",Sush, Hahahaha cool cool take ur time!!!!
1313,"28/12/17, 12:05:30 PM",Sush, I'm just being annoying
1314,"28/12/17, 12:05:36 PM",Sush, Not actually an emergency!
1315,"28/12/17, 12:08:42 PM",Pranathi, No it's not out of line at all
1316,"28/12/17, 12:08:43 PM",Pranathi, I would ask her
1317,"28/12/17, 12:08:47 PM",Pranathi, No's are free!
1318,"28/12/17, 12:08:54 PM",Pranathi, And I don't think she'll get upset with you
1319,"28/12/17, 12:09:13 PM",Pranathi, She knows subletting is not a guarantee that that rentee will pay full price
1320,"28/12/17, 12:09:25 PM",Pranathi," Plus even if she gets upset, whatevs"
1321,"28/12/17, 12:30:39 PM",Sush, That is correct

1382,"30/12/17, 9:40:07 AM",Pranathi, The worst of the polar vortex is almost over
1383,"30/12/17, 9:40:08 AM",Sush, Hiii
1384,"30/12/17, 9:40:09 AM",Pranathi, I think
1385,"30/12/17, 9:40:11 AM",Sush, Boarded
1386,"30/12/17, 9:40:15 AM",Sush, Ugh I hope so
1387,"30/12/17, 9:40:30 AM",Sush, Sitting in flight to Abu Dhabi
1388,"30/12/17, 9:40:33 AM",Pranathi, They're still flying into Chicago?
1389,"30/12/17, 9:40:40 AM",Pranathi, Okay good good

1395,"30/12/17, 9:41:28 AM",Pranathi, Throw trepidation out the window
1396,"30/12/17, 9:41:34 AM",Sush, It all feels so pointless sometimes
1397,"30/12/17, 9:41:50 AM",Sush, Why am I going to some far away country that's cold and away from my family
1398,"30/12/17, 9:41:45 AM",Pranathi, Take one nice long thaachi
1399,"30/12/17, 9:42:07 AM",Sush, Hyderabad is so nice and warm

1401,"30/12/17, 9:42:20 AM",Sush, Na? 
1402,"30/12/17, 9:42:31 AM",Sush, Not like I'm doing some nobel winning research
1403,"30/12/17, 9:42:37 AM",Pranathi, Buuuut we decided to do this and if we hadn't done it we might have lived a life of what-ifs
1404,"30/12/17, 9:42:48 AM",Sush, That the world will be worse off without
1405,"30/12/17, 9:42:55 AM",Sush, True 
1406,"30/12/17, 9:43:00 AM",Sush, I couldn't have sat in IFMR
1407,"30/12/17, 9:43:07 AM",Pranathi, Plus we can't really deny that our lives are probably even if just a little bit enriched by this experience
1408,"30/12/17, 9:43:21 AM",Sush, True 
1409,"30/12/17, 9:43:34 AM",Pranathi, Haan so you put off one solid thookam
1410,"30/12/17, 9:43:45 AM",Pranathi, And don't resent the cold
1411,"30/12/17, 9:43:53 AM",Sush, Ya 
1412,"30/12/17, 9:44:00 AM",Sush, I hope there are no delays!!
1413,"30/12/17, 9:44:08 AM",Pranathi, If you start resenting the cold the next three months will be unlivable
1414,"30/12/17, 9:44:17 AM",Sush, Gguuhh
1415,"30/12/17, 9:44:22 AM",Sush, I ordered stuff to layer
1416,"30/12/17, 9:44:21 AM",Pranathi, Me too! When do you land her?

1419,"30/12/17, 9:44:48 AM",Pranathi, Oh very nice
1420,"30/12/17, 9:45:16 AM",Pranathi, So even if it's delayed it'll still be daytime thank god
1421,"30/12/17, 9:47:36 AM",Sush, True!
1422,"30/12/17, 3:42:09 PM",Sush, So sleeepyyyy
1423,"30/12/17, 3:42:24 PM",Sush, How are you today?
1424,"30/12/17, 5:11:29 PM",Pranathi, Helloooo Sush-meter
1425,"30/12/17, 5:11:36 PM",Pranathi, Have you reached Abu Dhabi yet?
1426,"30/12/17, 5:11:44 PM",Pranathi, I was sleeping when you texted!
1427,"30/12/17, 5:11:46 PM",Sush, Hiii
1428,"30/12/17, 5:11:52 PM",Sush, Boarded my flight to Chicago
1429,"30/12/17, 5:11:58 PM",Sush, Waiting for takeofffff
1430,"30/12/17, 5:12:00 PM",Pranathi, Oh hurraaaay
1431,"30/12/17, 5:12:08 PM",Pranathi," Listen, my conscience is killing me"
1432,"30/12/17, 5:12:09 PM",Pranathi, About Ajooni
1433,"30/12/17, 5:12:16 PM",Pranathi, It's fine I slept with that other dude no?
1434,"30/12/17, 5:12:23 PM",Pranathi, We agreed we wouldn't be in a relationship or anything
1435,"30/12/17, 5:12:28 PM",Sush, About Medici dude?
1436,"30/12/17, 5:12:29 PM",Sush, Ohh
1437,"30/12/17, 5:12:33 PM",Sush, No it's fine!
1438,"30/12/17, 5:12:39 PM",Pranathi, Pakka?
1439,"30/12/17, 5:12:41 PM",Sush, Don't have to feel guilty
1440,"30/12/17, 5:12:44 PM",Sush, Yep yep
1441,"30/12/17, 5:12:52 PM",Pranathi, Because I spoke with Sneha and she sort of made me feel like I need to talk to her about it
1442,"30/12/17, 5:12:59 PM",Pranathi, But I don't see why because it would only make her feel bad
1443,"30/12/17, 5:13:03 PM",Sush, Don't have to be exclusive unless you want to and talked about it
1444,"30/12/17, 5:13:12 PM",Pranathi, And it's not like we're really committed to each other in that sense. We've only said there are feelings
1445,"30/12/17, 5:13:17 PM",Sush, Correct
1446,"30/12/17, 5:13:20 PM",Pranathi, We haven't even spent more than a week in each others' company!
1447,"30/12/17, 5:13:24 PM",Sush, You don't owe anything at this point
1448,"30/12/17, 5:13:26 PM",Pranathi, Seems silly to rush into anything
1449,"30/12/17, 5:13:28 PM",Pranathi, Okay good
1450,"30/12/17, 5:13:34 PM",Pranathi, Thank god you're sage and wise
1451,"30/12/17, 5:13:35 PM",Sush, You have both just expressed interest
1452,"30/12/17, 5:13:47 PM",Sush, And you're seeing where it's going
1453,"30/12/17, 5:13:51 PM",Pranathi, Did you get some sleep on the flight to AD?
1454,"30/12/17, 5:13:54 PM",Sush, 😂😘
1455,"30/12/17, 5:13:58 PM",Pranathi, Yes correct. Thank goodness for you
1456,"30/12/17, 5:14:02 PM",Sush, I did - about an hour!
1457,"30/12/17, 5:14:13 PM",Pranathi, Are you planning to sleep off on this flight?
1458,"30/12/17, 5:14:23 PM",Sush, I'm hoping to!
1459,"30/12/17, 5:14:28 PM",Sush, Will take melatonin
1460,"30/12/17, 5:14:41 PM",Pranathi, Oh very nice

1462,"30/12/17, 5:15:06 PM",Sush, Ya one chome girl
1463,"30/12/17, 5:15:18 PM",Pranathi, Oh lol. Dude I realized I always get Indians when I travel international
1464,"30/12/17, 5:15:24 PM",Pranathi, I don't know if this is racial profiling or not
1465,"30/12/17, 5:17:34 PM",Sush, Hahaha
1466,"30/12/17, 5:17:44 PM",Sush, I had a Pakistani dude last time
1467,"30/12/17, 5:17:47 PM",Sush, He was v sweet
1468,"30/12/17, 5:17:54 PM",Sush, But otherwise ya Indians only
1469,"30/12/17, 5:17:58 PM",Sush, Could still be racial
1470,"30/12/17, 5:19:55 PM",Pranathi," No? Some sort of desi. Even when I was coming back from HK, where there were so few Indians to begin with, I got an Indian couple"
1471,"30/12/17, 5:20:02 PM",Pranathi, Okay have a safe flight and text me when you land!
1472,"30/12/17, 5:20:11 PM",Pranathi, I'm going to that rapper Noname's concert tonight with Ajooni's friend Eve

1477,"30/12/17, 5:24:16 PM",Sush, What is a Noname?!
1478,"30/12/17, 5:27:46 PM",Pranathi, She's a female rapper from Chicago!
1479,"30/12/17, 5:27:51 PM",Pranathi, I think I have played her music before for you
1480,"30/12/17, 5:28:00 PM",Sush, So cool!
1481,"30/12/17, 5:28:03 PM",Sush, Haan?
1482,"30/12/17, 5:28:09 PM",Sush, Maybe I'll recall if I hear!
1483,"30/12/17, 5:28:11 PM",Pranathi, Yeah very nice lyrical stuff.
1484,"30/12/17, 5:28:17 PM",Sush, Noname is a great name
1485,"30/12/17, 5:28:18 PM",Pranathi, She's almost a beat poet
1486,"30/12/17, 5:28:32 PM",Sush, My family plays a card game that no one knows the name of
1487,"30/12/17, 5:28:36 PM",Pranathi, No? She used to go by Noname Gypsy but now she's just Noname. Packs a punch

1509,"01/01/18, 3:52:52 PM",Pranathi," And so true that romantic love breeds a certain kind of care, and maybe that's what we're missing when we're single!"
1510,"01/01/18, 11:27:18 PM",Pranathi, How was the temple?

1779,"05/01/18, 12:01:38 PM",Sush, He'll be an invaluable reference
1780,"05/01/18, 12:02:03 PM",Pranathi, Are you planning to do that?
1781,"05/01/18, 12:02:14 PM",Pranathi," Think about how you want to live the next 10 weeks. If it's going to make you miserable, don't do it"
1782,"05/01/18, 12:02:33 PM",Pranathi," But if you think that it's mostly bearable and you would learn something, then do it"
1783,"05/01/18, 12:02:42 PM",Sush, I'd def learn a lot
1784,"05/01/18, 12:02:44 PM",Pranathi, Just don't feel like you have to do it for a thing you may or may not even end up doing
1785,"05/01/18, 12:02:54 PM",Sush, Let's see
1786,"05/01/18, 12:02:56 PM",Pranathi, Otherwise you'd just be paying money and time for a reference
1787,"05/01/18, 12:03:03 PM",Sush, He's so 😴😴😴 though
1788,"05/01/18, 12:03:14 PM",Sush, Worth it😅

1817,"06/01/18, 12:00:58 AM",Sush, How was your night?
1818,"06/01/18, 12:01:07 AM",Pranathi, Ahh I'm so glad
1819,"06/01/18, 12:01:17 AM",Pranathi, I was worried and felt like a dick for not replying
1820,"06/01/18, 12:01:32 AM",Pranathi, Glad it turned out to be nice! I knew you'd love the show
1821,"06/01/18, 12:01:49 AM",Pranathi, My night was fine. I went to Skylark with some sociology peeps but I got bored
1822,"06/01/18, 12:02:00 AM",Pranathi, So I came home and got a little blazed and am watching Moana
1823,"06/01/18, 12:02:04 AM",Pranathi, It's a very cute movie
1824,"06/01/18, 12:02:08 AM",Sush, Not at allllll!
1825,"06/01/18, 12:02:11 AM",Sush, Niiice
1826,"06/01/18, 12:02:22 AM",Sush, I just got home and took a warm shower and tucked myself in
1827,"06/01/18, 12:02:28 AM",Sush, Ugh forgot to take chill pill
1828,"06/01/18, 12:02:37 AM",Sush, To leave warmth or miss dose?! Lol
1829,"06/01/18, 12:02:38 AM",Pranathi, Cute. I like that you said you tucked yourself in
1830,"06/01/18, 12:02:44 AM",Pranathi, Leave warmth!
1831,"06/01/18, 12:02:50 AM",Sush, 😭😭
1832,"06/01/18, 12:02:52 AM",Pranathi, Imagine how good it'll feel when you come back
1833,"06/01/18, 12:03:06 AM",Pranathi, I am missing Nick really hard today
1834,"06/01/18, 12:03:24 AM",Pranathi, And feeling very very sad about how he ended things
1835,"06/01/18, 12:03:35 AM",Sush, It does suck hard 
1836,"06/01/18, 12:03:36 AM",Pranathi, I don't know why. It's been a while since I felt sad
1837,"06/01/18, 12:03:52 AM",Pranathi, But I think I saw Rebecca and Timna
1838,"06/01/18, 12:03:58 AM",Pranathi, Today is their anniversary
1839,"06/01/18, 12:04:03 AM",Sush, And missed coupledom?
1840,"06/01/18, 12:04:14 AM",Pranathi, I remember the evening before her first date with Timna
1841,"06/01/18, 12:04:31 AM",Pranathi, I went over because Nick had just tried to break up with me the previous day
1842,"06/01/18, 12:04:40 AM",Sush, Oh man!
1843,"06/01/18, 12:04:41 AM",Pranathi, And that was a year ago
1844,"06/01/18, 12:05:03 AM",Pranathi, I think that's when stuff started getting bad and it makes me sad it's been a year since that
1845,"06/01/18, 12:05:03 AM",Sush, Siddhartha asked how you were and I told him nick turned out to be an ass
1846,"06/01/18, 12:05:16 AM",Sush, He said to give you his good vibes!
1847,"06/01/18, 12:05:25 AM",Pranathi, Aww that's so sweet
1848,"06/01/18, 12:05:32 AM",Pranathi, 💕
1849,"06/01/18, 12:05:35 AM",Sush, That's totally fair
1850,"06/01/18, 12:05:49 AM",Sush, You're doing such a great job at life though 💕
1851,"06/01/18, 12:06:12 AM",Pranathi, Like I still miss him though. I can't believe it's been almost half a year since and I'm not over it
1852,"06/01/18, 12:06:23 AM",Pranathi, I still feel so hurt and sad about that whole thing
1853,"06/01/18, 12:06:32 AM",Pranathi, I don't know if I'm doing that great
1854,"06/01/18, 12:06:46 AM",Pranathi," Anyway, I'm done whining about it. It's just sadness and it'll pass, always does"
1855,"06/01/18, 12:06:57 AM",Pranathi, Thanks for being so kind 💕
1856,"06/01/18, 12:07:26 AM",Sush, It's reasonable to feel hurt!
1857,"06/01/18, 12:07:33 AM",Sush, Half a year isn't even that long
1858,"06/01/18, 12:07:45 AM",Sush, It's still in the process of getting better
1859,"06/01/18, 12:08:10 AM",Pranathi, Yeah. This apartment just drives me insane
1860,"06/01/18, 12:08:15 AM",Pranathi, It's seen too much haha
1861,"06/01/18, 12:08:36 AM",Sush, We _need_ to believe that these were suboptimal choices for us and we're now free to make different choices
1862,"06/01/18, 12:09:00 AM",Sush, I can imagine 
1863,"06/01/18, 12:09:12 AM",Sush, Maybe you should move to Sneha's and give me your studio hahah
1864,"06/01/18, 12:09:36 AM",Pranathi," Sometimes when I'm encountering all these other people and they also turn out to be dicks, I wonder if Nick was the best I'll ever get"
1865,"06/01/18, 12:10:05 AM",Pranathi, Because I truly believe we loved each other at one point in time. I don't think I'll ever feel that love with abandon again
1866,"06/01/18, 12:10:22 AM",Sush," You will, I promise you."
1867,"06/01/18, 12:10:43 AM",Sush," I find it hard to convince myself too sometimes, but it's true."
1868,"06/01/18, 12:10:51 AM",Pranathi, And he was so integral to my life and so important to me. It's crazy he's just gone without a trace
1869,"06/01/18, 12:11:12 AM",Sush, It's the change of routine that's also so bewildering
1870,"06/01/18, 12:11:34 AM",Pranathi, Yeah I miss having him around
1871,"06/01/18, 12:11:41 AM",Pranathi, He was a very warm presence
1872,"06/01/18, 12:11:47 AM",Pranathi, And we cuddled so much last winter haha
1873,"06/01/18, 12:11:51 AM",Pranathi, Maybe I'm just cold
1874,"06/01/18, 12:12:00 AM",Pranathi, That's why all these emotions
1875,"06/01/18, 12:12:34 AM",Sush, Hungry / tired / scared / cold
1876,"06/01/18, 12:38:37 AM",Pranathi, Yeah exactly
1877,"06/01/18, 12:38:42 AM",Pranathi, So cold!
1878,"06/01/18, 12:38:47 AM",Pranathi, I just ate something else
1879,"06/01/18, 12:38:53 AM",Pranathi, Figured I was kinda hungry too

2412,"19/01/18, 3:48:07 PM",Pranathi, I definitely think we are not taught scripts for how to balance a partner with a life surrounded by friends
2413,"19/01/18, 3:48:15 PM",Pranathi, I know I'm guilty of doing it too
2414,"19/01/18, 3:48:32 PM",Pranathi, Of course. I felt it with Swetha too
2415,"19/01/18, 3:48:35 PM",Pranathi, And Nitya
2416,"19/01/18, 3:48:47 PM",Pranathi, I'm sure I inflicted that on them
2417,"19/01/18, 3:49:06 PM",Sush, i guess it's natural also
2418,"19/01/18, 3:49:12 PM",Pranathi, I wonder how we might figure out how to do the balance better
2419,"19/01/18, 3:49:17 PM",Sush, these people are _family_ now
2420,"19/01/18, 3:49:18 PM",Pranathi, Because Rebecca does a great job of it

2422,"19/01/18, 3:49:30 PM",Sush, i thought i was too
2423,"19/01/18, 3:49:54 PM",Pranathi, We end up privileging relationships that can eventually be institutionalized in ways like marriage no?
2424,"19/01/18, 3:50:15 PM",Sush, i don't know because i've never been in a real relationship
2425,"19/01/18, 3:50:28 PM",Pranathi, As though that brings us legitimacy in the eyes of our parents or family or whatever. Like that's a socially *valid* retreating or something?
2426,"19/01/18, 3:51:04 PM",Pranathi, Yeah it's not kind to our original support system
2427,"19/01/18, 3:51:13 PM",Pranathi, It's so hurtful
2428,"19/01/18, 3:51:56 PM",Pranathi, You're really good at being a friend
2429,"19/01/18, 3:52:05 PM",Pranathi, I think that so often about you
2430,"19/01/18, 3:54:08 PM",Sush, I can be awful too!
2431,"19/01/18, 3:54:18 PM",Sush, Clearly cheth and I were terrible to each other
2432,"19/01/18, 3:54:57 PM",Pranathi," Yeah, but you invest in friendships"
2433,"19/01/18, 3:55:03 PM",Pranathi, You care deeply

2662,"20/01/18, 5:20:44 PM",Sush, Only calorie burning
2663,"20/01/18, 5:20:50 PM",Sush," No strength, skill"

2671,"20/01/18, 5:22:09 PM",Pranathi, Even ice skating I can't do for that reason
2672,"20/01/18, 5:22:15 PM",Sush, Although I guess on Indian roads you need to be more afraid of falling down
2673,"20/01/18, 5:22:30 PM",Sush, These roads are almost sterile in comparison
2674,"20/01/18, 5:22:35 PM",Pranathi, Yeah that's true

2686,"20/01/18, 5:23:36 PM",Pranathi," I was like lol, please never come to India"
2687,"20/01/18, 5:23:44 PM",Sush, Lolol

2725,"20/01/18, 5:40:15 PM",Pranathi," Ready to do anything, just contented with whatever"
2726,"20/01/18, 5:40:48 PM",Pranathi, Oh btw! I saw Erin's status message
2727,"20/01/18, 5:40:52 PM",Pranathi, Where did she get PhD admit?
2728,"20/01/18, 5:48:06 PM",Sush, I can imagine 
2729,"20/01/18, 5:48:12 PM",Sush, Ohhhh Ohio state!!!!

2753,"20/01/18, 6:06:38 PM",Sush, Jessy and Dimitris and all
2754,"20/01/18, 6:06:40 PM",Pranathi, Oh you don't like J?
2755,"20/01/18, 6:06:43 PM",Pranathi, I thought you were best friends
2756,"20/01/18, 6:06:48 PM",Sush, 😅
2757,"20/01/18, 6:06:54 PM",Sush, That's just you
2758,"20/01/18, 6:06:59 PM",Sush, I can handle weird
2759,"20/01/18, 6:07:05 PM",Sush, But these are batshitcrazy people
2760,"20/01/18, 6:07:06 PM",Pranathi, That Dimitris also looks so creepy
2761,"20/01/18, 6:07:09 PM",Pranathi, Hahaha

2763,"20/01/18, 6:07:25 PM",Sush, Yaaa what a weirdo
2764,"20/01/18, 6:07:37 PM",Sush, Rodrigo says he's weird not creepy
2765,"20/01/18, 6:07:39 PM",Sush, I disagree
2766,"20/01/18, 6:07:43 PM",Sush, He's sooooo creepy
2767,"20/01/18, 6:07:45 PM",Sush, And awkward
2768,"20/01/18, 6:07:48 PM",Sush, It's painful
2769,"20/01/18, 6:07:53 PM",Sush, Jessy is painfully awkward
2770,"20/01/18, 6:08:19 PM",Sush, I think Rustom is pretty stuck up!
2771,"20/01/18, 6:08:41 PM",Pranathi, Yeah Rostam seems kind of stuck up.
2772,"20/01/18, 6:08:54 PM",Sush, Yaaaa I'm like first of all you're 23
2773,"20/01/18, 6:08:55 PM",Pranathi, But yeah these other two are just plain bizarro
2774,"20/01/18, 6:09:00 PM",Sush, Calm down you don't know everything
2775,"20/01/18, 6:09:12 PM",Sush, Yeah 😂
2776,"20/01/18, 6:10:22 PM",Sush, I think this Rustom sees himself as being very _wordly_
2777,"20/01/18, 6:10:28 PM",Sush, Worldly lol
2778,"20/01/18, 6:10:35 PM",Sush, So much for my italicisation
2779,"20/01/18, 6:10:39 PM",Pranathi, Hahaha.
2780,"20/01/18, 6:10:47 PM",Pranathi, This worldly thing is one interesting identity
2781,"20/01/18, 6:11:08 PM",Pranathi," I know other people too who I think characterize themselves as worldly, and I wonder what it is about that that makes people think it's appealing"
2782,"20/01/18, 6:11:26 PM",Sush, Ya! It makes me feel inadequate sometimes lol - it has become a thing in my head that I've 'never gone abroad'
2783,"20/01/18, 6:11:38 PM",Sush, *it had
2784,"20/01/18, 6:12:04 PM",Pranathi, Ahh really? Yeah I remember even Tara saying that
2785,"20/01/18, 6:12:20 PM",Sush, Ya!
2786,"20/01/18, 6:12:21 PM",Pranathi, Dude i'm bored
2787,"20/01/18, 6:12:25 PM",Sush, Esp wit JPAL junta
2788,"20/01/18, 6:12:26 PM",Pranathi, They're playing video games
2789,"20/01/18, 6:12:30 PM",Pranathi, I can just leave no
2790,"20/01/18, 6:12:34 PM",Pranathi, Oh they're very snobby ah
2791,"20/01/18, 6:12:35 PM",Sush, 80% of them were foreign educated
2792,"20/01/18, 6:12:55 PM",Sush, And they'd all talk like 'you _must_ eat the trout in Malta'
2793,"20/01/18, 6:13:14 PM",Sush, I'd be like ya the dosa in Udupi is v nice and feel provincial and uncool
2794,"20/01/18, 6:13:40 PM",Pranathi, HAHA what fartbags
2795,"20/01/18, 6:13:45 PM",Sush, 😂
2796,"20/01/18, 6:13:55 PM",Sush, I guess this is how older women talk maybe idk
2797,"20/01/18, 6:14:10 PM",Sush, Even the younger ones would be like they went backpacking in Argentina
2798,"20/01/18, 6:14:16 PM",Sush, I was fresh out of insti
2799,"20/01/18, 6:14:22 PM",Sush, I only went home for holidays
2800,"20/01/18, 6:14:43 PM",Pranathi, Hmm are they all from super loaded families?
2801,"20/01/18, 6:14:57 PM",Pranathi, Being in this house no? I am reminded of what a frugal upbringing we had in the U.S.
2802,"20/01/18, 6:15:06 PM",Sush, Ya! That was one of my big realisations in development
2803,"20/01/18, 6:15:35 PM",Pranathi," They never made us feel like we didn't have much, but seeing houses like this I'm realizing"
2804,"20/01/18, 6:15:44 PM",Sush, It was wrong for me because everyone else was super rich already and didn't to support families eventually on this salary because lol no not possible
2805,"20/01/18, 6:15:52 PM",Sush, I can imagine!!
2806,"20/01/18, 6:16:08 PM",Sush, Parents are uchicago?
2807,"20/01/18, 6:16:39 PM",Sush," For many people, their salary was pocket money"
2808,"20/01/18, 6:16:53 PM",Sush, About 50% were like us only
2809,"20/01/18, 6:16:53 PM",Pranathi," Yeah that's true. It's so hard not to compare though. Whenever I went to Tara's house, I would feel really weird about inviting her over to mine. And they were also the kinds that had the driver for every small excursion"
2810,"20/01/18, 6:17:00 PM",Pranathi, Yeah profs at UChicago
2811,"20/01/18, 6:17:01 PM",Sush," Like, making a living off this"
2812,"20/01/18, 6:17:02 PM",Pranathi, Booth
2813,"20/01/18, 6:17:10 PM",Sush, Ohhh fanceee
2814,"20/01/18, 6:17:19 PM",Pranathi, Oh I hadn't realized that's what JPal kids were like
2815,"20/01/18, 6:17:30 PM",Pranathi, I assumed it was a job for everyone
2816,"20/01/18, 6:17:38 PM",Pranathi, But I guess I knew only you and Suraj
2817,"20/01/18, 6:17:41 PM",Pranathi, And other insti junta
2818,"20/01/18, 6:17:47 PM",Sush, They all worked super hard at it
2819,"20/01/18, 6:17:58 PM",Sush, And were v good at what they did
2820,"20/01/18, 6:18:10 PM",Sush, But it was totally ok that it wouldn't eventually be enough money
2821,"20/01/18, 6:18:20 PM",Sush, It was more than enough for 1 person
2822,"20/01/18, 6:18:32 PM",Sush," V comfortable, I even managed to save a bit and invest a bit"
2823,"20/01/18, 6:18:42 PM",Sush," But the moment it isn't just you, nowhere near enough"
2824,"20/01/18, 6:19:03 PM",Pranathi, Yeah I can imagine.
2825,"20/01/18, 6:19:11 PM",Pranathi, I have never done that before and I wish I had
2826,"20/01/18, 6:19:18 PM",Pranathi, Like saved up some cash just to not have any savings at all
2827,"20/01/18, 6:19:43 PM",Sush, It's practically meaningless to save up in rupees tho if you're living in America
2828,"20/01/18, 6:19:47 PM",Pranathi," I realize with this PhD thing it's very paycheck to paycheck, especially with teaching subsidizing my stipend now"
2829,"20/01/18, 6:19:51 PM",Pranathi, Yeah that's also true
2830,"20/01/18, 6:20:09 PM",Sush, You'll put fight and save 1000-2000
2831,"20/01/18, 6:20:25 PM",Sush, It takes time to save that in inr
2832,"20/01/18, 6:21:03 PM",Sush, Ya in 2 years I saved about 2k
2833,"20/01/18, 6:21:06 PM",Pranathi," Yeah. When people here say they came from poor families, some of them really did, but others just mean they weren't *as rich*."
2834,"20/01/18, 6:21:14 PM",Sush, It felt big then - > 1 lakh!
2835,"20/01/18, 6:21:20 PM",Sush, Now I'm like oh
2836,"20/01/18, 6:21:21 PM",Pranathi, It is big
2837,"20/01/18, 6:21:28 PM",Pranathi, We just think in different currency now
2838,"20/01/18, 6:21:37 PM",Pranathi, For India that's a lot. You could do a bunch with that
2839,"20/01/18, 6:21:41 PM",Sush, Correct
2840,"20/01/18, 6:21:50 PM",Sush, Ya I can be unemployed for 3 months with that
2841,"20/01/18, 6:22:07 PM",Pranathi, Yeah for sure.
2842,"20/01/18, 6:22:09 PM",Pranathi, Had maggi?
2843,"20/01/18, 6:22:14 PM",Sush, No lol
2844,"20/01/18, 6:22:37 PM",Sush, I'm eating strawberries and maple syrup
2845,"20/01/18, 6:22:40 PM",Pranathi, Mmmm

2910,"20/01/18, 6:34:12 PM",Pranathi, Do I even deserve to live?!
2911,"20/01/18, 6:34:18 PM",Sush, Lack of kardashian fundas should never be lamented
2912,"20/01/18, 6:34:27 PM",Sush, *fundaes
2913,"20/01/18, 6:34:41 PM",Pranathi," Haha I mean technically it should be ""fundas"" or ""fundae"" no?"
2914,"20/01/18, 6:34:47 PM",Pranathi," I always wondered why it was ""fundaes"""
2915,"20/01/18, 6:34:51 PM",Pranathi, Double plural
2916,"20/01/18, 6:34:58 PM",Sush, 😤
2917,"20/01/18, 6:35:07 PM",Sush, Lol trueeee
2918,"20/01/18, 6:35:15 PM",Sush, But fundaes sounds better
2919,"20/01/18, 6:35:19 PM",Pranathi, Yeah true
2920,"20/01/18, 6:35:26 PM",Pranathi, I was thinking about this whole dating thing
2921,"20/01/18, 6:35:32 PM",Pranathi, And realizing I can't be in a relationship for the next three years
2922,"20/01/18, 6:35:40 PM",Sush, Why for?
2923,"20/01/18, 6:35:46 PM",Pranathi, I will be away for three months this year and nine months next year
2924,"20/01/18, 6:36:01 PM",Pranathi, And then the year after that I'll write and probably move somewhere else
2925,"20/01/18, 6:36:10 PM",Pranathi, So it makes no sense to get into a relationship with anyone here
2926,"20/01/18, 6:36:12 PM",Pranathi, In Chicago
2927,"20/01/18, 6:36:35 PM",Sush, All this logistics can be figured out if you meet someone you ❤️
2928,"20/01/18, 6:37:03 PM",Pranathi, But I don't think I'm capable of ❤ing any more...
2929,"20/01/18, 6:37:09 PM",Sush, Nonsense
2930,"20/01/18, 6:37:10 PM",Pranathi, I feel like everyone's far too deficient lol
2931,"20/01/18, 6:37:15 PM",Sush," You are, we all are"
2932,"20/01/18, 6:37:26 PM",Sush, Until you meet someone who's not
2933,"20/01/18, 6:37:39 PM",Sush, And they'll all be deficient just in ways that aren't deal breakers
2934,"20/01/18, 6:38:04 PM",Pranathi, Yeah I guess that's true
2935,"20/01/18, 6:41:29 PM",Pranathi, Got the bus yet?

3305,"29/01/18, 10:33:30 AM",Sush, I kinda want to work out of a cafe downtown
3306,"29/01/18, 10:34:44 AM",Pranathi," Ooh, do it!"
3307,"29/01/18, 10:34:44 AM",Pranathi, Do you have anything after class?
3308,"29/01/18, 10:35:01 AM",Sush, No nothing!
3309,"29/01/18, 10:35:21 AM",Pranathi, Ooh that'll be funnnn

3311,"29/01/18, 10:35:26 AM",Pranathi, Which cafe?
3312,"29/01/18, 10:35:53 AM",Sush, Maybe just dollop on Dearborn
3313,"29/01/18, 12:08:13 PM",Sush, dude
3314,"29/01/18, 12:08:28 PM",Sush, i think i made faux pas by making fun of shehla rashid!
3315,"29/01/18, 12:08:47 PM",Sush, in front of self proclaimed commie junta
3316,"29/01/18, 12:09:10 PM",Sush, but that kaamil irritated me in the beginning something he asked about where my job offer was from etc
3317,"29/01/18, 12:09:37 PM",Sush," and then before i could explain properly also he went on a rant about neoliberal econ models  - ""not that i can't understand but I JUST DON'T CARE"""
3318,"29/01/18, 12:09:45 PM",Sush, yaar i also don't care about your fish
3319,"29/01/18, 12:09:46 PM",Sush, now what
3320,"29/01/18, 12:09:58 PM",Sush, but i'm listening politely no
3321,"29/01/18, 1:09:53 PM",Pranathi," Sorry! Was working, just saw this"
3322,"29/01/18, 1:10:07 PM",Pranathi, Ehh it's okay. I can't even remember what you said about her
3323,"29/01/18, 1:10:43 PM",Pranathi," I don't think they'll care either. I think when you declared yourself firmly as Econ student at UChicago, they realized you weren't posturing to be a commie, which lets you off the hook imo"
3324,"29/01/18, 1:11:09 PM",Pranathi, I can't believe Kamil said that about your work. That's just fucking rude
3325,"29/01/18, 1:11:41 PM",Pranathi," Take your political ideologies and shove it up your ass, Kamil"
3326,"29/01/18, 1:11:41 PM",Pranathi, *ideology

3355,"29/01/18, 4:59:40 PM",Sush, i think my extra anxiety is because of thesis
3356,"29/01/18, 4:59:45 PM",Sush, i don't know how to not psych myself out
3357,"29/01/18, 4:59:45 PM",Pranathi, Take a deep breath!

3360,"29/01/18, 5:22:06 PM",Pranathi, Sorry
3361,"29/01/18, 5:22:21 PM",Pranathi, I got caught up trying to write some sentence and tied myself into knots lol
3362,"29/01/18, 5:22:25 PM",Pranathi, I hear you so hard

3368,"29/01/18, 5:23:09 PM",Sush, I'm scared to let this thesis thing get out of hand

3376,"29/01/18, 5:24:23 PM",Sush, I just feel terrified working on it
3377,"29/01/18, 5:24:34 PM",Sush, Because it's towards thesis
3378,"29/01/18, 5:26:19 PM",Pranathi, Just forget that it's about thesis if you can
3379,"29/01/18, 5:26:24 PM",Pranathi, I know it's easier said than done
3380,"29/01/18, 5:26:35 PM",Pranathi, But pretend that it's just for a class paper
3381,"29/01/18, 5:26:50 PM",Pranathi, Don't freak yourself out reminding yourself of the magnitude of the thing

3565,"02/02/18, 7:37:32 PM",Pranathi, Remember when asking for high fives was a thing?
3566,"02/02/18, 7:37:44 PM",Sush, Lolol 🙈
3567,"02/02/18, 7:37:52 PM",Pranathi, What a weird phase
3568,"02/02/18, 7:37:57 PM",Pranathi, 🙄
3569,"03/02/18, 9:42:27 AM",Sush, Entering Uber!

3576,"03/02/18, 1:26:04 PM",Pranathi, I read on laptop mostly
3577,"03/02/18, 1:27:59 PM",Pranathi, Unless it's a very long article
3578,"03/02/18, 2:23:19 PM",Sush, Makes senseeee
3579,"03/02/18, 2:23:27 PM",Sush, I’m experimenting with printing and reading
3580,"03/02/18, 2:24:10 PM",Pranathi, Is it working better?
3581,"03/02/18, 2:24:21 PM",Pranathi, When I need to speed read I try not to print because then I get too caught up in the individual sentences
3582,"03/02/18, 2:24:21 PM",Sush, A bit!
3583,"03/02/18, 2:24:32 PM",Sush, Soooo much distraction on the laptop
3584,"03/02/18, 2:24:36 PM",Sush, Ohhh makes sense
3585,"03/02/18, 2:24:46 PM",Sush, I really need to ‘learn’ to read
3586,"03/02/18, 2:24:53 PM",Sush, Motherfucking insti

3589,"03/02/18, 2:26:55 PM",Pranathi, No other way I can read on my laptop
3590,"03/02/18, 2:26:59 PM",Pranathi, Awww
3591,"03/02/18, 2:27:03 PM",Pranathi, I also don't want you to leave UChicago
3592,"03/02/18, 2:27:09 PM",Pranathi, I'm having severe separation anxiety tbh!
3593,"03/02/18, 2:27:18 PM",Sush, SAME
3594,"03/02/18, 2:27:28 PM",Sush, I ALSO DONT WANT TO STOP BEING A STUDENT
3595,"03/02/18, 2:27:34 PM",Sush, I DONT HAVE ENOUGH KNOWLEDGE TO STOP
3596,"03/02/18, 2:27:47 PM",Sush, I AM STILL AN EMPTY RECEPTACLE
3597,"03/02/18, 2:28:01 PM",Sush, I’ll stay in Chicago!
3598,"03/02/18, 2:31:36 PM",Pranathi, Chi shut up
3599,"03/02/18, 2:31:43 PM",Pranathi, Learning doesn't have to stop!
3600,"03/02/18, 2:31:48 PM",Pranathi, And you've learned so much!
3601,"03/02/18, 2:31:56 PM",Pranathi, Yeah but you'll be a busy working bee. 
3602,"03/02/18, 2:32:09 PM",Pranathi, And I am going to have to plan to see you
3603,"03/02/18, 2:32:12 PM",Pranathi, Not just ping you for coffee
3604,"03/02/18, 3:04:39 PM",Sush, Working people are more free I feel
3605,"03/02/18, 3:04:46 PM",Sush, Because you can leave work at work
3606,"03/02/18, 3:05:02 PM",Sush, I doubt I’ll be in a job important enough to not do that haha
3607,"03/02/18, 3:11:13 PM",Sush, Alsoooo we have to go to TJ + metro
3608,"03/02/18, 4:54:14 PM",Pranathi, Yaaaaa we should go to TJ+Metro
3609,"03/02/18, 4:54:17 PM",Pranathi, When?
3610,"03/02/18, 4:54:32 PM",Pranathi," And I'm sure you'll have a very fine, fancy job that you'll love"
3611,"03/02/18, 4:54:33 PM",Pranathi, Touchwood
3612,"03/02/18, 4:54:47 PM",Pranathi," Btw, I texted that guy who randomly kissed the side of my ear"
3613,"03/02/18, 4:54:53 PM",Pranathi, And said that it was not okay
3614,"03/02/18, 4:54:56 PM",Pranathi, He apologized
3615,"03/02/18, 5:00:00 PM",Sush, Oh good! Do you feel better about it ?
3616,"03/02/18, 5:00:29 PM",Pranathi, I was actually worried that I made too much of a scene about it
3617,"03/02/18, 5:00:37 PM",Pranathi, I told Josh first and he was pretty appalled and said he'd talk to him
3618,"03/02/18, 5:00:56 PM",Pranathi, Then I said I should talk to him myself. I think this situation reminded me too much of that whole thing with Mukesh
3619,"03/02/18, 5:01:25 PM",Pranathi," So after I told him I felt super guilty about projecting or something. But then this guy replied saying, ""I get that way when I'm drunk, and that wasn't the appropriate setting for that behavior."""
3620,"03/02/18, 5:01:38 PM",Pranathi, And I replied saying there's no appropriate setting for physical contact without consent
3621,"03/02/18, 5:02:05 PM",Pranathi, He said I was right. Then I've been wondering if that was too harsh for just a peck on the cheek
3622,"03/02/18, 5:32:57 PM",Sush," No, good you reached out!"
3623,"03/02/18, 5:36:55 PM",Sush, It’s not harsh- you reached out privately
3624,"03/02/18, 5:48:01 PM",Pranathi, Yeah true
3625,"03/02/18, 5:48:19 PM",Pranathi, Dude I'm an Uber with a couple speaking entirely in Mandarin
3626,"03/02/18, 5:48:39 PM",Pranathi, Is that what it feels like for others when we speak in Tamil in an Uber?
3627,"03/02/18, 5:49:07 PM",Pranathi, Or Yoober as some call it affectionately
3628,"03/02/18, 5:49:17 PM",Pranathi, I took an yoober
3629,"03/02/18, 5:49:37 PM",Pranathi, I'm going to a concert with Rebecca and Timna and some people I met at that party
3630,"03/02/18, 5:49:57 PM",Pranathi, Kimbra ante one singer
3631,"03/02/18, 5:50:03 PM",Pranathi, Who is she? She's one girl
3632,"03/02/18, 6:02:03 PM",Sush, 😂😂
3633,"03/02/18, 6:02:08 PM",Sush, Yoobeerrr
3634,"03/02/18, 6:02:11 PM",Sush, Lolol ya
3635,"03/02/18, 6:02:24 PM",Sush, Maybe they’re saying something bitchy about someone!
3636,"03/02/18, 6:02:28 PM",Sush, Or Americans lol
3637,"03/02/18, 6:02:36 PM",Pranathi, Probably Americans lol.
3638,"03/02/18, 6:02:42 PM",Sush, 😅
3639,"03/02/18, 6:02:44 PM",Pranathi, Or our Uber driver paati
3640,"03/02/18, 6:02:59 PM",Sush, 😅😅
3641,"03/02/18, 6:03:12 PM",Pranathi, She's swerving like one crazy person
3642,"03/02/18, 6:03:21 PM",Sush, Oh man!

3647,"03/02/18, 6:04:09 PM",Sush, 🙈😅
3648,"03/02/18, 6:04:20 PM",Sush, It was supposed to be tomorrow
3649,"03/02/18, 6:04:27 PM",Sush, But this Chelsea wants to hang out tonight
3650,"03/02/18, 6:04:31 PM",Sush, So idk
3651,"03/02/18, 6:04:37 PM",Sush, I’m just sitting and reading
3652,"03/02/18, 6:04:47 PM",Pranathi, So studious girl
3653,"03/02/18, 6:05:01 PM",Sush, I’m reading a book 😅
3654,"03/02/18, 6:05:04 PM",Pranathi, I also should've worked today. But this concert sounded fun
3655,"03/02/18, 6:05:17 PM",Pranathi, Ohhh so nice which one?
3656,"03/02/18, 6:06:01 PM",Sush, The Bright Hour
3657,"03/02/18, 6:06:19 PM",Sush, It’s a memoir by a lady with terminal breast cancer
3658,"03/02/18, 6:06:40 PM",Sush," Haylee, Nina, Katherine and I are reading it together!"
3659,"03/02/18, 6:06:50 PM",Pranathi, Whaaaat so nice!
3660,"03/02/18, 6:06:55 PM",Pranathi, You have a book club

3662,"03/02/18, 6:07:11 PM",Sush, You come hang out with these people once!
3663,"03/02/18, 6:07:19 PM",Pranathi, Yeah I was just thinking that
3664,"03/02/18, 6:07:24 PM",Pranathi, They sound very cool
3665,"03/02/18, 6:07:27 PM",Sush, I want to show you them and then you!

3670,"03/02/18, 6:10:56 PM",Sush, Poh-sibly
3671,"03/02/18, 6:11:19 PM",Sush, but I also kinda just want to go back to mansueto and work on thesis
3672,"03/02/18, 6:11:27 PM",Sush, It’s soooo hard to work on it during the week
3673,"03/02/18, 6:11:38 PM",Sush, Immediate assignments end up taking so much energy
3674,"03/02/18, 6:11:46 PM",Pranathi, Yeah for sure
3675,"03/02/18, 6:11:54 PM",Pranathi, I hear you
3676,"03/02/18, 6:12:00 PM",Pranathi, I should've stayed at home really
3677,"03/02/18, 6:12:02 PM",Pranathi, 🙈
3678,"03/02/18, 6:12:03 PM",Sush, Also because I suck at planning mostly
3679,"03/02/18, 6:12:12 PM",Sush, Nooo enjoy the concert!
3680,"03/02/18, 6:12:17 PM",Pranathi, Feeling very guilty now
3681,"03/02/18, 6:12:27 PM",Sush, It’s Saturday night!
3682,"03/02/18, 6:12:34 PM",Pranathi, She's driving like a crazy person dude
3683,"03/02/18, 6:12:36 PM",Sush, What guilt
3684,"03/02/18, 6:12:42 PM",Pranathi, I'm actually scared lol
3685,"03/02/18, 6:12:43 PM",Sush, Tell her to slow down!!!!
3686,"03/02/18, 6:12:49 PM",Sush, You’re entitled to!
3687,"03/02/18, 6:13:01 PM",Pranathi, I keep telling her
3688,"03/02/18, 6:13:07 PM",Sush, One man got annoyed with me but I told him I value my life over his annoyance lol
3689,"03/02/18, 6:13:13 PM",Sush, Ugh worst
3690,"03/02/18, 6:14:14 PM",Sush, These paatis are also so uncooperative
3691,"03/02/18, 6:14:14 PM",Pranathi, Yeah also she has no idea where we're going
3692,"03/02/18, 6:14:19 PM",Pranathi, I'm so stressed out
3693,"03/02/18, 6:14:26 PM",Sush, What colour Paati is she
3694,"03/02/18, 6:14:32 PM",Sush, Either way uncooperative
3695,"03/02/18, 6:14:39 PM",Sush, Because only 2 colours lol
3696,"03/02/18, 6:14:47 PM",Pranathi, Lol like race?
3697,"03/02/18, 6:14:50 PM",Sush, ya

3699,"03/02/18, 6:15:01 PM",Pranathi, But I think she's Jamaican
3700,"03/02/18, 6:15:10 PM",Sush, Paatis here are so cranky
3701,"03/02/18, 6:16:07 PM",Pranathi, Yeah chi I hate sitting in strangers' cars

3710,"05/02/18, 3:37:30 PM",Pranathi," Yes, sorry, I was going to call you after 5. I have a deadline and I had meetings all day so couldn't work on anything"
3711,"05/02/18, 3:37:35 PM",Pranathi, Just lowkey panicking
3712,"05/02/18, 3:37:47 PM",Sush, Ok good luck good luck!! 💚
3713,"05/02/18, 3:37:57 PM",Pranathi, Well I didn't get kidnapped but I did end up having some weird knee popping thing when I was walking
3714,"05/02/18, 3:38:05 PM",Pranathi, Went to student health and they said there's some fluid build up
3715,"05/02/18, 3:38:08 PM",Sush, Ayyo!!
3716,"05/02/18, 3:38:15 PM",Pranathi, I was worried there might be a meniscus tear
3717,"05/02/18, 3:38:28 PM",Pranathi," There still might be, but she says it's unlikely considering I can still walk"
3718,"05/02/18, 3:38:39 PM",Pranathi, But I have to rest it and put ice
3719,"05/02/18, 3:38:46 PM",Sush, Ya I think those are mad painful

3874,"11/02/18, 4:16:35 PM",Sush, and that mofo just complains about food
3875,"11/02/18, 4:16:41 PM",Sush, it's really like a saas-bahu show

3890,"11/02/18, 4:20:00 PM",Sush, it'd take more to make her leave i think

3892,"11/02/18, 4:20:05 PM",Sush, but she won't
3893,"11/02/18, 4:20:31 PM",Sush," her parents have already said we will support you - this situation is ridiculous - say the word, we'll get you out"
3894,"11/02/18, 4:20:53 PM",Sush, but honestly i'd fear that they'd try and take full custody of amairah
3895,"11/02/18, 4:20:56 PM",Sush, that MIL is nuts
3896,"11/02/18, 4:21:28 PM",Pranathi, That's what happened to my mom's cousin
3897,"11/02/18, 4:21:47 PM",Pranathi," She was in an abusive relationship and her husband was crazy, crazy violent"
3898,"11/02/18, 4:21:55 PM",Pranathi, She tried to leave but they fought for custody of the child and won
3899,"11/02/18, 4:22:04 PM",Pranathi, So they've had the kid since he was 10 and he's been brainwashed against his mom
3900,"11/02/18, 4:22:15 PM",Sush, oh my god 
3901,"11/02/18, 4:22:16 PM",Pranathi," He's my brother's age now, 21, and he doesn't ever want to speak to his mom"

3903,"11/02/18, 4:22:26 PM",Sush, WHAT IS WRONG WITH PEOPLE
3904,"11/02/18, 4:22:38 PM",Pranathi, She's literally so heartbroken and has been for 11 years
3905,"11/02/18, 4:22:42 PM",Pranathi, Every time she sees my brother she cries
3906,"11/02/18, 4:22:47 PM",Pranathi, It's so horrible
3907,"11/02/18, 4:22:48 PM",Sush, oh man 
3908,"11/02/18, 4:23:00 PM",Sush, you grow a thing for 9 months and feed it and grow it and keep it
3909,"11/02/18, 4:23:10 PM",Sush, and an abusive crazy takes it away from you
3910,"11/02/18, 4:23:23 PM",Sush, and she probably even stayed longer than she wanted to for the kid
3911,"11/02/18, 4:23:24 PM",Sush, UGH
3912,"11/02/18, 4:23:51 PM",Pranathi, Yeah

3926,"11/02/18, 4:28:32 PM",Pranathi, I should read this after I go get groceries I think
3927,"11/02/18, 4:28:38 PM",Pranathi, Once sunset happens I don't feel like going outside only
3928,"11/02/18, 4:28:45 PM",Sush, correct
3929,"11/02/18, 4:28:54 PM",Sush, groceries are important also in this weather
3930,"11/02/18, 4:29:00 PM",Pranathi, What to make for lunch/dinner this week I am thinking

3939,"11/02/18, 4:30:02 PM",Sush," i'd keep chopped onion, bell peppers, tomato in the fridge"
3940,"11/02/18, 4:30:16 PM",Sush, and then i'd put that masala padad in the microwave
3941,"11/02/18, 4:30:26 PM",Sush, throw the veggies on top and sprinkle chat masala
3942,"11/02/18, 4:30:33 PM",Pranathi, OOOH

3945,"11/02/18, 4:30:39 PM",Pranathi, Such a good idea
3946,"11/02/18, 4:30:46 PM",Sush, we can also add chickpeas instead of papad
3947,"11/02/18, 4:30:46 PM",Pranathi, I don't have masala papad though 
3948,"11/02/18, 4:30:54 PM",Pranathi," Correct, like sundal types"
3949,"11/02/18, 4:30:59 PM",Sush, like a little bean salad
3950,"11/02/18, 4:31:01 PM",Sush, haan!
3951,"11/02/18, 4:31:02 PM",Pranathi, Or salad if we're being fancy
3952,"11/02/18, 4:31:15 PM",Pranathi, Sundal's a good thing to have in the fridge too I feel
3953,"11/02/18, 4:31:22 PM",Sush, correct
3954,"11/02/18, 4:31:24 PM",Pranathi, It's easy to make and it's good to have that protein with food
3955,"11/02/18, 4:31:30 PM",Sush, ya!
3956,"11/02/18, 4:31:34 PM",Sush, and cut fruits!

3959,"11/02/18, 4:31:54 PM",Sush, but so $$$$

4435,"19/02/18, 3:44:24 PM",Pranathi, They might know of some TAships outside the department also
4436,"19/02/18, 3:44:47 PM",Sush, i don't think we have a program coordinator
4437,"19/02/18, 3:45:03 PM",Pranathi, Or write to James Evans?

4444,"19/02/18, 3:45:25 PM",Pranathi, But that pays more than a TA also
4445,"19/02/18, 3:45:33 PM",Sush, ohh  do you know for what class?
4446,"19/02/18, 3:46:10 PM",Sush, is it kosher to just email a prof and ask if you can TA for them
4447,"19/02/18, 3:46:16 PM",Pranathi, Nope. I think it depends on what prof is taking the course
4448,"19/02/18, 3:46:20 PM",Sush, there's a class at harris i think i'd be a good fit for
4449,"19/02/18, 3:46:22 PM",Pranathi," Yeah, what do you have to lose?"

4539,"19/02/18, 4:09:33 PM",Pranathi," Haha Afrofuturism is actually really cool. It's the idea that African Americans have been so enslaved and maligned against in this world, that perhaps there exists a future which is far more utopian"
4540,"19/02/18, 4:09:56 PM",Pranathi," So this whole movement started off as a way of imagining these futures through art, literature, film etc."
4541,"19/02/18, 4:10:07 PM",Pranathi, HI ERIN!!
4542,"19/02/18, 4:10:16 PM",Sush, ohhh v interesting!

4578,"19/02/18, 9:22:20 PM",Sush, did he try to emotionally unload again
4579,"19/02/18, 9:22:26 PM",Pranathi, But we bumped into some of my friends

4629,"19/02/18, 9:29:25 PM",Pranathi," I don't expect to keep texting him, I stopped replying only"
4630,"19/02/18, 9:29:44 PM",Pranathi, But just some token that I'm not going to run in the opposite direction and it doesn't have to be a whole awkward thing

5802,"27/03/18, 2:31:03 PM",Pranathi, I would say to them that it sounds like they're being aggressive and it feels particularly violent considering you've agreed to their terms and conditions
5803,"27/03/18, 2:31:23 PM",Sush, Right?!
5804,"27/03/18, 2:31:31 PM",Sush, Is this not bullying right out?
5805,"27/03/18, 2:31:33 PM",Pranathi," That it doesn't make sense to be so violent when someone's being accommodating, and they have to think long and hard about their gone"

5952,"02/04/18, 4:22:36 PM",Sush, even the red quinoa didn't ruin it

6002,"04/04/18, 11:52:12 AM",Pranathi, I love the I have friends song
6003,"04/04/18, 11:52:13 AM",Sush, 😂😂😂
6004,"04/04/18, 11:52:17 AM",Sush, it's so cute no!
6005,"04/04/18, 11:52:40 AM",Sush, last week someday i was bored and everyone was busy and my head was like 'i have friends i definitely have friends' 😂
6006,"04/04/18, 11:55:02 AM",Pranathi, It's so cute!
6007,"04/04/18, 11:55:13 AM",Pranathi, Awww you definitely have friends
6008,"04/04/18, 11:55:13 AM",Pranathi, ❤
6009,"04/04/18, 11:55:20 AM",Sush, haahaha ❤!
6010,"04/04/18, 11:55:25 AM",Pranathi, And this Research Me song is you with Valentina 
6011,"04/04/18, 11:55:30 AM",Sush, ISN'T IT
6012,"04/04/18, 11:55:33 AM",Sush, 100%
6013,"04/04/18, 11:55:40 AM",Sush, i could literally see the bitch singing it
6014,"04/04/18, 11:55:49 AM",Sush, paavam maybe she's not a bitch idk
6015,"04/04/18, 11:55:56 AM",Sush, _he_ is she isn't haha
6016,"04/04/18, 11:56:06 AM",Pranathi, I'm always amused by the weird points at which guilt hits you
6017,"04/04/18, 11:56:15 AM",Sush, 😂
6018,"04/04/18, 11:56:17 AM",Pranathi, For bitching about her 
6019,"04/04/18, 11:56:32 AM",Sush, i hate when i bitch about her 
6020,"04/04/18, 11:56:37 AM",Pranathi, Why?
6021,"04/04/18, 11:56:45 AM",Sush, it feels fundamentally unfeminist or something
6022,"04/04/18, 11:56:49 AM",Sush, _he_ decided to date her
6023,"04/04/18, 11:56:54 AM",Sush, _he_ decided to treat me poorly
6024,"04/04/18, 11:57:09 AM",Sush, she was pursuing something that made her happy and was available to her
6025,"04/04/18, 11:57:31 AM",Pranathi, Yeah that's true
6026,"04/04/18, 11:57:46 AM",Pranathi, But also women can be awful to each other and internalized misogyny is definitely a thing.
6027,"04/04/18, 11:57:59 AM",Pranathi, There's no point trying to ignore that because women do act spitefully toward each other sometimes
6028,"04/04/18, 11:58:03 AM",Sush, he was a person in an 'open relationship' that she met and pursued - fully kosher
6029,"04/04/18, 11:58:19 AM",Sush, v true!
6030,"04/04/18, 11:58:26 AM",Sush, valentina owes me literally nothing tho
6031,"04/04/18, 11:58:36 AM",Pranathi, Yeah that's true.
6032,"04/04/18, 11:58:39 AM",Sush, not like shabba / sneha dating sid
6033,"04/04/18, 11:59:06 AM",Pranathi, Yeah that's totally fair. He's the one to be mad at
6034,"04/04/18, 11:59:10 AM",Pranathi, Especially because of the open relationship tag
6035,"04/04/18, 11:59:15 AM",Sush, yep!
6036,"04/04/18, 11:59:27 AM",Pranathi, Like I feel slightly more entitled to feeling angry about this Lauren woman because she knew we were in an exclusive relationship
6037,"04/04/18, 11:59:39 AM",Sush, fair!
6038,"04/04/18, 11:59:50 AM",Pranathi," And yes, she didn't know me, but I think values are about behaving with integrity even when it's not about what you owe or don't owe someone"
6039,"04/04/18, 12:00:24 PM",Sush, it takes two though
6040,"04/04/18, 12:00:35 PM",Pranathi, Yeah for sure. Nick is like 99% to blame
6041,"04/04/18, 12:00:40 PM",Sush, yeah agree
6042,"04/04/18, 12:00:49 PM",Pranathi, But there is this 1% complicity that irks me still
6043,"04/04/18, 12:00:56 PM",Pranathi, Samvita is probably a better example of that though
6044,"04/04/18, 12:01:08 PM",Sush, ys samvita was more steal-y
6045,"04/04/18, 12:01:17 PM",Pranathi, She happily took advantage of me for that election and would spend hours with me daily listening to me cry about that fellow
6046,"04/04/18, 12:01:28 PM",Sush, that's horrible
6047,"04/04/18, 12:02:09 PM",Pranathi, Yeah disgusting woman
6048,"04/04/18, 12:02:15 PM",Sush, totally!
6049,"04/04/18, 12:02:15 PM",Pranathi, I feel sorry for her though
6050,"04/04/18, 12:02:18 PM",Pranathi, I saw her at the wedding
6051,"04/04/18, 12:02:21 PM",Pranathi, Sabnam's wedding
6052,"04/04/18, 12:02:25 PM",Sush, she's soulless robot i feel
6053,"04/04/18, 12:02:29 PM",Pranathi, And I felt nothing but some weird sense of pity
6054,"04/04/18, 12:02:39 PM",Pranathi, Like poor you for still having to deal with that squib
6055,"04/04/18, 12:02:45 PM",Sush, she is also squib i think
6056,"04/04/18, 12:02:51 PM",Sush, they deserve each othre
6057,"04/04/18, 12:03:10 PM",Sush," i'm glad you escaped - i wish the process of your liberation was less painful, but PHEW"
6058,"04/04/18, 12:03:14 PM",Pranathi, Yeah happy squibness
6059,"04/04/18, 12:03:24 PM",Pranathi, PHEW only. I feel so relieved to be here on this side
6060,"04/04/18, 12:03:30 PM",Sush, correct ❤
6061,"04/04/18, 12:03:31 PM",Pranathi, Happily single doing our own things
6062,"04/04/18, 12:03:39 PM",Pranathi, We aren't doing too badly I feel ❤
6063,"04/04/18, 12:04:06 PM",Sush, we are #lit
6064,"04/04/18, 12:04:29 PM",Sush, friends friends friendly friends we have all the friends 👻
6065,"04/04/18, 12:04:45 PM",Sush, I WISH I LIVED IN A MUSICAL TV SHOW
6066,"04/04/18, 12:04:54 PM",Sush, i'm listening to glee songs now
6067,"04/04/18, 12:05:40 PM",Pranathi, Hahahaha. We do have all the friedns
6068,"04/04/18, 12:05:42 PM",Pranathi, *friends
6069,"04/04/18, 12:05:49 PM",Pranathi, I didn't know you were a glee fan!
6070,"04/04/18, 12:05:55 PM",Sush, i LOVE glee 😂😂
6071,"04/04/18, 12:06:01 PM",Sush, esp early seasons
6072,"04/04/18, 12:06:05 PM",Sush, did you ever get into it?
6073,"04/04/18, 12:06:14 PM",Pranathi, It all makes sense to me! Of course you would be into Glee!
6074,"04/04/18, 12:06:20 PM",Sush, hahahaha
6075,"04/04/18, 12:06:23 PM",Pranathi, I watched one season when it was on TV! But didn't really get into it
6076,"04/04/18, 12:06:30 PM",Sush, i'm exactly the type of lame for Glee 
6077,"04/04/18, 12:06:42 PM",Sush, ohh
6078,"04/04/18, 12:06:42 PM",Pranathi, Hahaha you're not lame
6079,"04/04/18, 12:06:47 PM",Pranathi, Own your Gleek Pride
6080,"04/04/18, 12:06:48 PM",Sush, glee is funfunfun
6081,"04/04/18, 12:07:00 PM",Pranathi, It is fun! Until people started dying lol
6082,"04/04/18, 12:07:02 PM",Sush, i LOVE when two characters sing the same song
6083,"04/04/18, 12:07:16 PM",Sush, and they bring their personalities and current life crises to bear
6084,"04/04/18, 12:07:46 PM",Sush, so exciting and drama
6085,"04/04/18, 12:08:22 PM",Pranathi, Hahaha you love drama
6086,"04/04/18, 12:08:26 PM",Pranathi, You queeeeen
6087,"04/04/18, 12:08:33 PM",Pranathi, ❤
6088,"04/04/18, 12:08:37 PM",Sush, hahaha
6089,"04/04/18, 12:08:41 PM",Sush, i love it
6090,"04/04/18, 12:09:05 PM",Sush, if i could sing i'd do musical theatre
6091,"04/04/18, 12:09:06 PM",Sush, 100%
6092,"04/04/18, 12:09:41 PM",Pranathi, I could see you for SURE in a musical!
6093,"04/04/18, 12:09:50 PM",Pranathi, I wish I was more into it
6094,"04/04/18, 12:14:54 PM",Sush, i think i'm very into escapist drama
6095,"04/04/18, 12:15:35 PM",Pranathi, Haha escapist in what way?
6096,"04/04/18, 12:16:06 PM",Sush, i feel like music offers a certain distance from the reality of the often pretty dreary circumstances that actors are singing about
6097,"04/04/18, 12:16:26 PM",Sush, it gives me leeway to construct a little fairytale out of my own blah life 
6098,"04/04/18, 12:16:54 PM",Pranathi, Yeah that makes sense. What's your favorite musical?
6099,"04/04/18, 12:17:03 PM",Pranathi, Have you seen Rent?
6100,"04/04/18, 12:17:08 PM",Sush, i haven't!
6101,"04/04/18, 12:17:13 PM",Sush, i've seen v few!
6102,"04/04/18, 12:17:18 PM",Pranathi, It's pretty good!
6103,"04/04/18, 12:17:18 PM",Sush, that's why i like bollywood i think haha
6104,"04/04/18, 12:17:25 PM",Sush, i love music in stories basically
6105,"04/04/18, 12:19:06 PM",Pranathi, That's totally fair. 
6106,"04/04/18, 12:19:21 PM",Pranathi, I like musicals but I don't listen to that music for music fixes
6107,"04/04/18, 12:19:24 PM",Pranathi, If that makes sense
6108,"04/04/18, 12:20:54 PM",Sush, fair!
6109,"04/04/18, 12:21:07 PM",Sush, i actually find it hard to connect with music that didn't come to me via a story!
6110,"04/04/18, 12:21:25 PM",Pranathi, So interestingggg I wonder what the psychology of music is
6111,"04/04/18, 12:21:47 PM",Sush," ya and also people 'discover' music in such different ways, no?"
6112,"04/04/18, 12:22:26 PM",Pranathi, Yeah for sure. I actually read an interesting chapter on that in a book I was reading for my project
6113,"04/04/18, 12:22:31 PM",Pranathi, How people consume music and find new music
6114,"04/04/18, 12:22:55 PM",Pranathi," It says that despite the changes in technology, there's a path dependency about how most people listen to music"
6115,"04/04/18, 12:23:11 PM",Pranathi, People aren't likely to change their tastes easily despite the proliferation of technology
6116,"04/04/18, 12:24:12 PM",Sush, that's so interesting!
6117,"04/04/18, 12:24:36 PM",Sush, the machine learning behind spotify's 'discover weekly' thing is also _fascinating_
6118,"04/04/18, 12:25:00 PM",Sush, and part of their assumption is that people want 'new' music that's only slightly different from what they listen to
6119,"04/04/18, 12:25:16 PM",Pranathi, Yeah so interesting!! I hate that it's all automated tbh
6120,"04/04/18, 12:25:43 PM",Pranathi, I looked for jobs at Spotify and was crushed to know there's no job for someone wanting to make hand-curated playlists
6121,"04/04/18, 12:25:54 PM",Sush, hahaha!
6122,"04/04/18, 12:26:17 PM",Sush, i kind of _love_ that behaviour can be aggregated to find macro patterns that can do these things
6123,"04/04/18, 12:26:43 PM",Sush, you really searched for making hand-curated playlists at spotify? i LOVE that
6124,"04/04/18, 12:26:55 PM",Sush, it sounds like an amazing job
6125,"04/04/18, 12:27:09 PM",Pranathi, I know. 
6126,"04/04/18, 12:27:13 PM",Sush, hahahaa
6127,"04/04/18, 12:27:16 PM",Sush, i'm amused also
6128,"04/04/18, 12:28:30 PM",Pranathi," I like that these patterns exist but I feel like it takes the whimsy out of it. I would like to have really random music thrown at me that's good just musically. I would love for my tastes to be eclectic, unpredictable, but also grounded in what's musically solid"
6129,"04/04/18, 12:29:10 PM",Sush, i hear you!
6130,"04/04/18, 12:29:24 PM",Sush, i get distracted by how _fascinating_ these algorithms are
6131,"04/04/18, 12:30:09 PM",Sush, it is kind of a pity that the era of random discovery on the internet is pretty much over
6132,"04/04/18, 12:30:16 PM",Pranathi, Yeah true 
6133,"04/04/18, 12:30:18 PM",Sush, every single thing we see is being tailored by something
6134,"04/04/18, 12:30:28 PM",Pranathi, That's so tragiccccc
6135,"04/04/18, 12:30:36 PM",Sush, i barely even read books that are not on my goodreads
6136,"04/04/18, 12:31:31 PM",Sush, ok so i'm working on a side project
6137,"04/04/18, 12:31:35 PM",Sush, just v early stages
6138,"04/04/18, 12:31:41 PM",Sush, on a LIPSTICK RECOMMENDATION ENGINE
6139,"04/04/18, 12:31:51 PM",Sush, 💄💄💄💄💄💄
6140,"04/04/18, 12:32:03 PM",Pranathi, WHAAAT
6141,"04/04/18, 12:32:06 PM",Sush, and by 'working on it' i mean i'm reading up on recommendation algos
6142,"04/04/18, 12:33:18 PM",Pranathi, Dude that sounds amaaaaazing
6143,"04/04/18, 12:33:28 PM",Pranathi, So it'll tell you what kind of lipstick to buy/

6528,"15/04/18, 11:03:20 PM",Sush, i mean i guess maybe he doesn't know the extent of the animosity between us?
6529,"15/04/18, 11:03:26 PM",Sush, i'm just annoyed at mikhail also
6530,"15/04/18, 11:03:37 PM",Sush, why couldn't he just give francisco the number or whatever

6540,"15/04/18, 11:10:20 PM",Pranathi, To string you along until he made up his mind? Not okay. And you deserve far better than someone who can't be sure. But it makes sense why you'd be chewtoying now
6541,"15/04/18, 11:10:25 PM",Pranathi, And also why you'd be embarrassed

6601,"17/04/18, 10:59:45 PM",Pranathi, He was super weird to me before class today
6602,"17/04/18, 10:59:51 PM",Sush, the one you went out with?
6603,"17/04/18, 11:00:05 PM",Pranathi," So I texted him and said if he's not interested, that's totally fine with me, but I'm addressing it because I didn't want things to get awkard"
6604,"17/04/18, 11:00:23 PM",Pranathi," And he said, ""Could've been more direct, I'm sorry!"""
6605,"17/04/18, 11:00:30 PM",Pranathi, That made me feel worse though 
6606,"17/04/18, 11:00:50 PM",Pranathi, Ewwww I feel unloveable and I know it's in my head and I didn't even really care
6607,"17/04/18, 11:00:56 PM",Pranathi, But it feels like double rejection today
6608,"17/04/18, 11:01:18 PM",Sush," ugh i'm sorry, that sounds so frustrating!"
6609,"17/04/18, 11:01:25 PM",Sush, you are SO FRIKKIN lovable tho

6614,"17/04/18, 11:02:31 PM",Pranathi, I think I should just consciously stop.
6615,"17/04/18, 11:02:40 PM",Pranathi, Like constant rejection doesn't do wonders for anyone's ego
6616,"17/04/18, 11:03:26 PM",Sush, maybe take a break?
6617,"17/04/18, 11:03:48 PM",Sush, just the nature of online dating i think lets people treat others in a cavalier manner
6618,"17/04/18, 11:04:07 PM",Pranathi, Yeah. 
6619,"17/04/18, 11:04:17 PM",Pranathi, Also Rebecca practiced her interview on breakups with me today

6638,"18/04/18, 6:43:14 PM",Sush, Maybe! I hope so
6639,"18/04/18, 6:43:17 PM",Pranathi, They have their own politics and stuff sometimes
6640,"18/04/18, 6:43:21 PM",Sush, True
6641,"18/04/18, 6:43:33 PM",Pranathi, I think you're a star only
6642,"18/04/18, 6:43:38 PM",Sush, and I also didn’t see myself as a good fit there
6643,"18/04/18, 6:43:55 PM",Sush, I hope other people will also think I’m a star 😭
6644,"18/04/18, 6:44:13 PM",Sush, It’s a v corporate-y space

7314,"13/05/18, 9:03:29 PM",Pranathi, I think he got boring
7315,"13/05/18, 9:03:36 PM",Pranathi, He stopped writing about stuff like this
7316,"13/05/18, 9:03:37 PM",Sush, Ohh ok
7317,"13/05/18, 9:03:41 PM",Pranathi, That's when he got into his scapes stuff I feel
7318,"13/05/18, 9:03:45 PM",Sush, I thought he became Sanghi or something
7319,"13/05/18, 9:04:03 PM",Pranathi," Lol no. Not to my knowledge, but ofc Sneha has way more awareness of the private lives of academics"
7320,"13/05/18, 9:04:10 PM",Pranathi, I somehow never find myself looking it up
7321,"13/05/18, 10:09:41 PM",Sush,

7331,"13/05/18, 10:13:34 PM",Sush, she stressed me out about job hunt
7332,"13/05/18, 10:13:40 PM",Sush, i ostriched her
7333,"13/05/18, 10:13:46 PM",Sush, and she is one tension party
7334,"13/05/18, 10:13:52 PM",Sush, she'll never say eh chill it'll be fine

7336,"13/05/18, 10:14:21 PM",Pranathi," Ayyo don't worry, she is just putting herself in your shoes. You come ask me"
7337,"13/05/18, 10:14:25 PM",Pranathi, I will tell you eh chill it'll be fine
7338,"13/05/18, 10:14:35 PM",Pranathi, She is thinking in a mother-like fashion
7339,"13/05/18, 10:14:47 PM",Pranathi, And also I would be most happy if someone I knew married Dhoni
7340,"13/05/18, 10:14:58 PM",Sush, right!?

7377,"14/05/18, 8:54:27 PM",Pranathi," ""I'm full of surprises"""
7378,"14/05/18, 8:54:37 PM",Pranathi, Lolol that would be funny

7381,"14/05/18, 8:55:58 PM",Pranathi, I really would say that
7382,"14/05/18, 8:56:25 PM",Pranathi, I think he's already admiring of your spunk
7383,"14/05/18, 8:56:31 PM",Sush, my instinct was 'I KNOW RIGHT?!' lol
7384,"14/05/18, 8:57:09 PM",Pranathi, Hahaha then that's what you should say
7385,"14/05/18, 8:57:15 PM",Pranathi, I know right?
7386,"14/05/18, 8:57:21 PM",Pranathi, I think that would be funny
7387,"14/05/18, 8:57:25 PM",Sush, ok i will lol
7388,"14/05/18, 8:57:29 PM",Pranathi, Go by your instinct lol
7389,"14/05/18, 8:57:33 PM",Pranathi, Mine suck apparently
7390,"14/05/18, 8:57:38 PM",Pranathi, I think this Dustin's over me
7391,"14/05/18, 8:58:02 PM",Sush, it's been two days!
7392,"14/05/18, 8:58:14 PM",Pranathi, Nooooo but it's a weird message
7393,"14/05/18, 8:58:17 PM",Pranathi," To say ""good night but we'll talk soon!"""
7394,"14/05/18, 8:58:28 PM",Pranathi, What does we'll talk soon mean? It's like please don't expect this to be a regular thing
7395,"14/05/18, 8:58:59 PM",Sush, that is a weird thing to say
7396,"14/05/18, 8:59:59 PM",Pranathi, Yeah I think I should interpret it as him being over it
7397,"14/05/18, 9:00:07 PM",Pranathi, But I don't know what went wrong...
7398,"14/05/18, 9:00:25 PM",Sush, i don't think he'd say talk soon tho
7399,"14/05/18, 9:00:29 PM",Sush, if he was done
7400,"14/05/18, 9:00:32 PM",Sush, i mean he doesn't need to
7401,"14/05/18, 9:00:46 PM",Pranathi, I guess. But it's a weirdly distancing thing to say
7402,"14/05/18, 9:01:13 PM",Sush, we don't know how he normally talks tho
7403,"14/05/18, 9:04:14 PM",Pranathi, I just asked him lol
7404,"14/05/18, 9:04:25 PM",Pranathi, Nothing to lose either way
7405,"14/05/18, 9:04:44 PM",Sush, what you asked?
7406,"14/05/18, 9:04:54 PM",Pranathi, I said
7407,"14/05/18, 9:05:13 PM",Pranathi, Just clarifying
7408,"14/05/18, 9:05:36 PM",Sush, lol done and dustin
7409,"14/05/18, 9:05:51 PM",Pranathi, I thought that was pretty funny lol
7410,"14/05/18, 9:05:58 PM",Sush, 🤦🏽‍♀😂
7411,"14/05/18, 9:06:06 PM",Pranathi, Was that a bad move?
7412,"14/05/18, 9:07:02 PM",Sush," i mean - nothing to lose, no?"
7413,"14/05/18, 9:07:09 PM",Sush," possible a bit premature, but it's ok"
7414,"14/05/18, 9:08:19 PM",Pranathi, I just figure if he's actually into it he'll rush to dissuade me of it
7415,"14/05/18, 9:08:28 PM",Pranathi, But it's possible that's not an attractive thing to do either
7416,"14/05/18, 9:08:36 PM",Pranathi, To admit vulnerability
7417,"14/05/18, 9:08:49 PM",Sush, true - and possible unhealthy for your peace of mind to set up these tests no?
7418,"14/05/18, 9:09:10 PM",Sush, like i don't want it to stress _you_ out
7419,"14/05/18, 9:09:24 PM",Pranathi, I would be less stressed out if he would just say it directly tbh
7420,"14/05/18, 9:09:33 PM",Pranathi, The weird communication games are NOT my jam
7421,"14/05/18, 9:09:53 PM",Pranathi, And either way I don't think I want to be with someone who can't just speak their mind
7422,"14/05/18, 9:10:02 PM",Sush, fair!
7423,"14/05/18, 9:10:07 PM",Pranathi, Done with these emotionally stunted men
7424,"14/05/18, 9:10:19 PM",Sush, i saw some mother's day tweet
7425,"14/05/18, 9:10:32 PM",Sush, asking to be wished for all the emotionally stunted men she's had to mother
7426,"14/05/18, 9:11:07 PM",Pranathi, Oh yeah I saw that too hahaha
7427,"14/05/18, 9:13:47 PM",Sush, omg this boy's name is ORIEL

7460,"14/05/18, 9:39:22 PM",Sush, he replied?
7461,"14/05/18, 9:39:40 PM",Pranathi, But also I think he's totally done and I am feeling like he will just not reply

8159,"28/05/18, 10:27:13 PM",Pranathi, And that she doesn't mean it to be rude but people don't mean it as a compliment
8160,"28/05/18, 10:27:28 PM",Pranathi, Didn't know what that meant because I'm not Kardashian-literate haha
8161,"28/05/18, 10:28:55 PM",Sush, 😂😂
8162,"28/05/18, 10:29:10 PM",Sush, Khloe used to look lovely
8163,"28/05/18, 10:29:16 PM",Sush, and then she lost a ton of weight
8164,"28/05/18, 10:29:30 PM",Sush, In an unhealthy sort of way
8165,"28/05/18, 10:29:41 PM",Sush, but her face is still v pretty
8166,"28/05/18, 10:29:47 PM",Sush, she also just seems nice haha
8167,"28/05/18, 10:30:06 PM",Pranathi, I felt like Rebecca thought it was rude because she was chubby
8168,"28/05/18, 10:30:30 PM",Pranathi, I just feel deeply self conscious about being perceived as chubby lol

8173,"29/05/18, 3:54:24 PM",Pranathi, I'm freaking out about this meeting we had
8174,"29/05/18, 3:54:33 PM",Pranathi, Where they basically said we're not doing enough to get jobs
8175,"29/05/18, 3:54:41 PM",Pranathi, And that we should be doing a bunch more networking
8176,"29/05/18, 3:57:43 PM",Sush, You have 2-3 years to network!
8177,"29/05/18, 3:57:49 PM",Sush, No?
8178,"29/05/18, 3:58:05 PM",Pranathi, Yeah but they're making it seem so dire
8179,"29/05/18, 3:58:11 PM",Pranathi, And Rebecca ofc is way more stressed out
8180,"29/05/18, 3:58:17 PM",Pranathi, So I had to comfort her but I am only not sure
8181,"29/05/18, 3:58:22 PM",Pranathi, So I'm a little stressed
8182,"29/05/18, 3:58:31 PM",Sush, ayyo!
8183,"29/05/18, 3:58:47 PM",Sush, these people blow it out of proportion though
8184,"29/05/18, 3:58:53 PM",Sush, To cover their asses
8185,"29/05/18, 3:59:11 PM",Sush, Take 30% of the direness they are suggesting

8188,"29/05/18, 3:59:33 PM",Pranathi," Yeah. I know I'm fine only, but it was such an annoying meeting"
8189,"29/05/18, 3:59:47 PM",Pranathi," I felt like I was being infantilized and scared into doing my work, which I hate"
8190,"29/05/18, 3:59:56 PM",Pranathi, I hate being told what to do as though I'm not already doing it
8191,"29/05/18, 3:59:58 PM",Pranathi, Yuck
8192,"29/05/18, 4:00:09 PM",Sush, Ugh that sounds v annoying!

8194,"29/05/18, 4:00:19 PM",Sush, And alarmist
8195,"29/05/18, 4:00:23 PM",Sush, Ooh how was that?
8196,"29/05/18, 4:00:23 PM",Pranathi," Then I asked her which year she's in, because I thought she was a grad student"
8197,"29/05/18, 4:00:33 PM",Pranathi, She got super offended and turns out she's a prof in Comparative Lit
8198,"29/05/18, 4:00:42 PM",Sush, omg!
8199,"29/05/18, 4:00:43 PM",Pranathi, It was really awkward 
8200,"29/05/18, 4:00:44 PM",Sush, So silly
8201,"29/05/18, 4:00:50 PM",Sush, I did that to a prof in TTIC
8202,"29/05/18, 4:00:55 PM",Sush, she was so flattered lol

8348,"05/06/18, 11:35:47 PM",Sush, babe I feel like I overstepped. I was wondering out loud and I should have been more mindful about what I was saying
8349,"05/06/18, 11:37:01 PM",Pranathi," Yeah, that was a bit of a whammy, and I think I'm already feeling kind of touchy so it just hit me in the wrong place. I didn't mean to cut the call, but I just needed to bawl a little and I didn't really want to be on the phone for that."
8350,"05/06/18, 11:37:49 PM",Sush," that is entirely fair - and if it matters at all, I don’t think you do it with men - I was very mindless in thinking out loud"
8351,"05/06/18, 11:38:27 PM",Pranathi," I don't know, maybe I do. It makes sense, but I just feel a little overwhelmed!"
8352,"05/06/18, 11:39:56 PM",Sush, I guess I was also thinking in terms of the anxiety of things going wrong - I can fully relate to this when I see other people do it - esp after Chetana I’ve found myself thinking ‘this is the end’ v often - this is probably reasonable given how the last year or so has been for us
8353,"05/06/18, 11:40:32 PM",Sush, like I was thinking maybe that’s how your mom feels
8354,"05/06/18, 11:41:20 PM",Sush, again it’s obviously speculation because I don’t know your mom - i was wondering because I have this anxiety and it sometimes manifests in are we ok are we ok
8355,"05/06/18, 11:42:13 PM",Pranathi," Yeah, I know that's how my mom feels. I just get frustrated because she's my mom and I want her to mother me, not the other way around."
8356,"05/06/18, 11:42:41 PM",Sush, Totally fair. You should get to sit back and be taken care of sometimes
8357,"05/06/18, 11:42:53 PM",Pranathi," It feels awful when it falls on me to assure her of that, and it falls on me more often than not."
8358,"05/06/18, 11:43:50 PM",Sush, Understandable! Esp when it feels accusatory
8359,"05/06/18, 11:44:21 PM",Sush, Can I call? Do you feel like talking?
8360,"05/06/18, 11:44:33 PM",Sush, I’m so sorry I upset you
8361,"05/06/18, 11:45:25 PM",Pranathi," Yeah. Anyway, I didn't really intend to discuss my mom for so long. It really isn't a big deal and I won't even think about it in the morning. But I think I'm just feeling really weirdly sensitive and emotional right now"
8362,"05/06/18, 11:45:32 PM",Pranathi, Don't apologize! But would it be okay if we spoke tomorrow?
8363,"05/06/18, 11:45:38 PM",Pranathi, I just feel easily cry-ey lol
8364,"05/06/18, 11:46:45 PM",Sush, You talk about your mom as much as you want! It’s a hugely important relationship and somehow talking about boys is more normalised!
8365,"05/06/18, 11:47:17 PM",Sush, Yes ❤️ but also it’s 100% ok to be cry-ey to me if you feel like!
8366,"05/06/18, 11:49:48 PM",Pranathi," I know! I just don't want to think about it now because it feels heavy and I'm overwhelmed by all the things I feel sad about. So I very very much love you and want to talk tomorrow, but I think I will just watch The Office and laugh at their dumb jokes for a bit. Would that be okay?"
8367,"05/06/18, 11:51:04 PM",Sush, Absolutely❤️ love you so much! and I’m sorry I was I was unthinking and daddi!
8368,"05/06/18, 11:51:25 PM",Pranathi," You stop apologizing! ❤ Good night, love you toooooo!"
8369,"06/06/18, 11:54:19 AM",Pranathi, Sorry I haven't called back yet. Thought I'd have time between my meeting and office hours
8370,"06/06/18, 11:54:33 AM",Pranathi, But it's been nonstop. I finish at 2! I'll call then?
8371,"06/06/18, 2:25:49 PM",Pranathi, Hi! Just got done

8409,"07/06/18, 12:18:41 PM",Sush, Correct
8410,"07/06/18, 12:18:54 PM",Sush, And water just feels entirely unappealing when you’re sick
8411,"07/06/18, 12:19:10 PM",Pranathi, Yeah already nose is blocked etc. so it feels not so freeing haha

9057,"29/06/18, 6:26:59 PM",Pranathi," Yeah! It's nice to see that this one is so strong. Even your other friend, Melanie!"

9143,"01/07/18, 2:04:13 PM",Pranathi, I told her to get in touch with Oviya also

9152,"01/07/18, 2:05:08 PM",Sush, I think she’s still in Madurai let me check
9153,"01/07/18, 2:05:13 PM",Pranathi, I'm getting stressed that I haven't started interviews
9154,"01/07/18, 2:05:24 PM",Pranathi," Can't rush also, but I'm just sitting around at home"
9155,"01/07/18, 2:05:40 PM",Sush, When you’ll start?
9156,"01/07/18, 2:05:41 PM",Pranathi, Anyway I am having stomach upset
9157,"01/07/18, 2:05:45 PM",Sush, Ayyo!
9158,"01/07/18, 2:05:48 PM",Sush, Paapa!
9159,"01/07/18, 2:05:52 PM",Pranathi, Ugh one whole hungama happened with that Tenma fellow
9160,"01/07/18, 2:06:10 PM",Pranathi, I forgot his name and I was swiping on Tinder Chennai just to see. Literally he was the first person
9161,"01/07/18, 2:06:14 PM",Sush, Whaat😂😂
9162,"01/07/18, 2:06:17 PM",Sush, Omg hahaha
9163,"01/07/18, 2:06:20 PM",Pranathi, Then I opened his bio after I swiped
9164,"01/07/18, 2:06:26 PM",Pranathi, Then I was like fuckkkkkk
9165,"01/07/18, 2:06:29 PM",Sush, Ouccch
9166,"01/07/18, 2:06:31 PM",Pranathi, But ofc he caught on
9167,"01/07/18, 2:06:34 PM",Sush, Lolol
9168,"01/07/18, 2:06:49 PM",Pranathi," And then I was like haha, let's just forget about it, accident!"
9169,"01/07/18, 2:07:03 PM",Sush, 🤦🏽‍♀️😂
9170,"01/07/18, 2:07:08 PM",Pranathi," He said no no, can separate. I was worried about being more forceful because then I was worried he'd not give me interview"
9171,"01/07/18, 2:07:17 PM",Pranathi, We chatted for a while and then I went off outside
9172,"01/07/18, 2:07:21 PM",Pranathi, So forgot to reply
9173,"01/07/18, 2:07:35 PM",Pranathi, That night I came home and texted and he was like suuuuuper salty
9174,"01/07/18, 2:07:41 PM",Sush, Oh no!
9175,"01/07/18, 2:07:48 PM",Pranathi, I said sorry to get back to business but when interview?
9176,"01/07/18, 2:07:55 PM",Pranathi, He said he's really busy and has to check his schedule
9177,"01/07/18, 2:08:01 PM",Sush, His dick must have shriveled up
9178,"01/07/18, 2:08:07 PM",Pranathi, Which is all BS because I think it's an ego thing
9179,"01/07/18, 2:08:10 PM",Sush, Pardon my subtlety
9180,"01/07/18, 2:08:16 PM",Sush, Ya seriously!
9181,"01/07/18, 2:08:17 PM",Pranathi, Lolol love your imagery
9182,"01/07/18, 2:08:25 PM",Pranathi, But now I'm waiting for him to get back to me
9183,"01/07/18, 2:08:31 PM",Pranathi, Which is soooo annoying
9184,"01/07/18, 2:08:39 PM",Sush, ugh ya 
9185,"01/07/18, 2:08:48 PM",Pranathi," Anyway, I've decided to sit on his head and ping him every few days"
9186,"01/07/18, 2:08:55 PM",Sush, Pack off tinder in Chennai 
9187,"01/07/18, 2:09:00 PM",Pranathi, Have to be pushy with these things
9188,"01/07/18, 2:09:04 PM",Pranathi, Yeah I deleted it
9189,"01/07/18, 2:09:10 PM",Sush, I don’t trust men to put that aside
9190,"01/07/18, 2:09:13 PM",Pranathi, I saw too many people I knew
9191,"01/07/18, 2:09:20 PM",Sush, Ugh lol
9192,"01/07/18, 2:09:45 PM",Pranathi, Yeah. So now I'm just going to wait till he gives me a date
9193,"01/07/18, 2:09:53 PM",Pranathi, He did give me other suggestions also
9194,"01/07/18, 2:10:00 PM",Pranathi, So I don't think he's too mad
9195,"01/07/18, 2:10:04 PM",Sush, Oh phew
9196,"01/07/18, 2:10:11 PM",Pranathi, But he's definitely not as ready to meet me immediately as he was
9197,"01/07/18, 2:10:18 PM",Pranathi, He said something so weird though
9198,"01/07/18, 2:10:20 PM",Sush, Take his tiny ego a couple of days to get over it I imagine
9199,"01/07/18, 2:10:22 PM",Sush, What?
9200,"01/07/18, 2:10:26 PM",Pranathi, I think he was trying to figure out my caste
9201,"01/07/18, 2:10:52 PM",Pranathi," He was like, ""Should i take you to Vyasarpadi beef biryani or Bay 146?"""
9202,"01/07/18, 2:11:07 PM",Sush, Abbah
9203,"01/07/18, 2:11:10 PM",Pranathi, Which also might be a class thing but beef...
9204,"01/07/18, 2:11:21 PM",Sush, That’s so loaded
9205,"01/07/18, 2:11:38 PM",Sush, And designed to make you feel bad about bay 146
9206,"01/07/18, 2:11:44 PM",Pranathi," I know right. Anyway, he'll probably eventually acquiesce"
9207,"01/07/18, 2:11:50 PM",Pranathi, It's just frustrating that I was so stupid
9208,"01/07/18, 2:11:55 PM",Sush, You should look like bay 146 and want to go to biryani
9209,"01/07/18, 2:11:55 PM",Pranathi, Like I could've checked the name
9210,"01/07/18, 2:12:11 PM",Sush, Tinder is so fast fast it could happen
9211,"01/07/18, 2:12:20 PM",Pranathi, Exactly. I wish I could include in my memos lol
9212,"01/07/18, 2:12:33 PM",Pranathi, Such an interesting question to ask someone to figure out caste and class status
9213,"01/07/18, 2:12:39 PM",Sush, Seriously!
9214,"01/07/18, 2:12:50 PM",Sush, and the moment you say you don’t eat meat you’re the dick there
9215,"01/07/18, 2:12:56 PM",Pranathi, I'm meeting Milind some time this week hopefully. Looks like he's on holiday
9216,"01/07/18, 2:13:02 PM",Sush, Ohh nice!
9217,"01/07/18, 2:13:07 PM",Sush, He should have good leads
9218,"01/07/18, 2:13:10 PM",Pranathi, I'm also meeting SP who's ugh but he is a Carnatic singer
9219,"01/07/18, 2:13:12 PM",Sush, And maybe even insights
9220,"01/07/18, 2:13:14 PM",Sush, Lolol
9221,"01/07/18, 2:13:17 PM",Sush, Ya he’s useful
9222,"01/07/18, 2:13:18 PM",Pranathi, And he might have something interesting to say
9223,"01/07/18, 2:13:30 PM",Sush, Even if inadvertently 😅
9224,"01/07/18, 2:13:34 PM",Pranathi, Yeah this whole not eating meat thing lol
9225,"01/07/18, 2:13:50 PM",Pranathi, Yeah he's probably going to be interesting to talk about the caste in Carnatic question with
9226,"01/07/18, 2:13:57 PM",Sush, Ya!!
9227,"01/07/18, 2:14:03 PM",Pranathi, I'm also going to some kutcheri this week

9230,"01/07/18, 2:14:17 PM",Sush, I’m excited for you to uncover all this
9231,"01/07/18, 2:14:34 PM",Sush, (and I want to vicariously uncover also)
9232,"01/07/18, 2:14:54 PM",Pranathi," Yeah it's not like I'm not doing anything, but it's just busy emailing work at this point which is frustrating. I've also emailed some Dalit activists but I'm worried they will get annoyed at both my English and my Tamil"
9233,"01/07/18, 2:14:57 PM",Pranathi, Hahaha me too!
9234,"01/07/18, 2:15:05 PM",Pranathi," I will tell you all, not to worry"
9235,"01/07/18, 2:15:11 PM",Pranathi, What are you going to do today?
9236,"01/07/18, 2:15:18 PM",Sush, Oh ya! Such a tricky line to balance
9237,"01/07/18, 2:15:24 PM",Sush, I’m on 6 back from downtown now
9238,"01/07/18, 2:15:36 PM",Pranathi, Oh you dropped her off?

9240,"01/07/18, 2:16:07 PM",Sush, We took her bag and left in the morning
9241,"01/07/18, 2:16:14 PM",Pranathi, Oh nice nice. Where does she live again?
9242,"01/07/18, 2:16:20 PM",Sush, I told her about Chetana and mikhail and cried lol
9243,"01/07/18, 2:16:27 PM",Sush, She’s in Harvard now doing the MPA
9244,"01/07/18, 2:16:48 PM",Sush, but she’s interning in DC at the world bank over he summer
9245,"01/07/18, 2:16:54 PM",Pranathi, Aww paavam! ♥️ was she comforting and kind?
9246,"01/07/18, 2:17:05 PM",Pranathi, Oh so fancy! Does she like her programme?
9247,"01/07/18, 2:17:26 PM",Sush, Ya she was! She also had a lot to share

9254,"01/07/18, 2:18:43 PM",Pranathi, My mom is so funny
9255,"01/07/18, 2:18:56 PM",Pranathi, She wanted to send my details to that guy's family
9256,"01/07/18, 2:19:17 PM",Pranathi," He seems okay only. He also interned in Waterloo! But maybe he's boring to talk to, who knows"
9257,"01/07/18, 2:19:33 PM",Pranathi," Anyway, my mom wrote a little write up about me to send and it was so cute haha"
9258,"01/07/18, 2:19:40 PM",Pranathi, She included that I like jazz and all
9259,"01/07/18, 2:19:58 PM",Sush, Omg! So cute and thoughtful!
9260,"01/07/18, 2:20:02 PM",Pranathi, I was so touched she thought about those things and she's genuinely being so chill about it
9261,"01/07/18, 2:20:16 PM",Pranathi, I told her I might say no immediately at any point
9262,"01/07/18, 2:20:23 PM",Pranathi," She was like ya ya, who cares about them"
9263,"01/07/18, 2:20:29 PM",Pranathi, This is only for you
9264,"01/07/18, 2:20:34 PM",Sush, That’s so nice! And just the right attitude!

9324,"01/07/18, 4:07:04 PM",Pranathi, I felt kinda meh because my school friend Tanvi was so lukewarm about meeting when I said I was back
9325,"01/07/18, 4:07:34 PM",Pranathi," Like she says she's busy all week and can only meet Saturday for dinner perhaps. I know people have lives and all, but it's also just annoying because I don't have anyone to hang out with here"
9326,"01/07/18, 4:07:51 PM",Pranathi, Haha I sound super petulant
9327,"01/07/18, 4:08:02 PM",Sush, Stupid Tanvi
9328,"01/07/18, 4:08:07 PM",Pranathi, I just need to get out of the house and do something social

9332,"01/07/18, 4:08:38 PM",Sush, Pucca
9333,"01/07/18, 4:08:40 PM",Pranathi, He's fine! He keeps hanging out with his friends and going to kutcheris
9334,"01/07/18, 4:08:54 PM",Pranathi, He asked me to tag along to kutcheri today but I had stomach upset so didn't want to risk
9335,"01/07/18, 4:09:15 PM",Pranathi, Amma is making poori tomorrow 😍
9336,"01/07/18, 4:09:16 PM",Sush, Paavam! Are you doing Xtra pooping

9342,"01/07/18, 4:09:44 PM",Sush, Yaaaa
9343,"01/07/18, 4:09:46 PM",Pranathi, I think it was flight food
9344,"01/07/18, 4:09:52 PM",Pranathi, Or maybe Amethyst
9345,"01/07/18, 4:10:15 PM",Pranathi, I spoke to one old classmate from school called Akshay today because I randomly dreamed about him!
9346,"01/07/18, 4:10:30 PM",Pranathi, And felt like I should reach out. It was suchhhhh a lovely nostalgic conversation
9347,"01/07/18, 4:10:44 PM",Pranathi, He's in Chennai only and I asked if we could meet
9348,"01/07/18, 4:10:46 PM",Sush, So nice!
9349,"01/07/18, 4:10:54 PM",Sush, Maybe Akshay is the man of your dreams
9350,"01/07/18, 4:10:58 PM",Pranathi, Then he said he can't tell me what exactly but he's in no condition to meet
9351,"01/07/18, 4:11:07 PM",Pranathi, That he may not be for the next decade or so
9352,"01/07/18, 4:11:13 PM",Sush, Whaat
9353,"01/07/18, 4:11:23 PM",Pranathi," My heart sort of broke and I don't know what's up, but he said he doesn't feel like being social"
9354,"01/07/18, 4:11:26 PM",Sush, What does that even mean
9355,"01/07/18, 4:11:30 PM",Sush, Paavam!
9356,"01/07/18, 4:11:30 PM",Pranathi, I wonder if it's depression or something
9357,"01/07/18, 4:11:37 PM",Pranathi, Ugh it made me so sad
9358,"01/07/18, 4:11:45 PM",Pranathi, I've just been lying in bed and tossing and turning
9359,"01/07/18, 4:11:56 PM",Pranathi, In 9th standard he cycled to my house once to surprise me
9360,"01/07/18, 4:12:13 PM",Pranathi," I brought it up today and he said he remembers everything about it, what I was wearing and all"
9361,"01/07/18, 4:12:27 PM",Sush, omg paavam 
9362,"01/07/18, 4:12:32 PM",Pranathi, And then said he wishes he could go back to those times because everything was so much simpler and the smallest things made him happy
9363,"01/07/18, 4:12:34 PM",Sush, You think he’s hurt or something?
9364,"01/07/18, 4:12:36 PM",Sush, Oh wow
9365,"01/07/18, 4:12:43 PM",Sush, Sounds like depression only 
9366,"01/07/18, 4:12:51 PM",Pranathi, Yeah. 
9367,"01/07/18, 4:12:56 PM",Pranathi, Paaaaaavam
9368,"01/07/18, 4:13:14 PM",Pranathi, God life is so hard for some people. I asked him what he was doing twice but he didn't respond
9369,"01/07/18, 4:13:31 PM",Pranathi, This boy is adopted. MS Swaminathan's grandson
9370,"01/07/18, 4:13:38 PM",Sush, So paavam 
9371,"01/07/18, 4:13:44 PM",Sush, Even Gayathri isn’t doing anything
9372,"01/07/18, 4:13:54 PM",Sush, She hasn’t been able to because of her mental health stuff
9373,"01/07/18, 4:14:14 PM",Pranathi, Aaaaand weirdly my mom also told me that that boy she's trying to wrangle into something is somehow related to this Akshay
9374,"01/07/18, 4:14:23 PM",Pranathi, That's so sad. It must feel so crippling
9375,"01/07/18, 4:14:29 PM",Sush, Oh!
9376,"01/07/18, 4:14:33 PM",Sush, Ya man

9379,"01/07/18, 4:15:19 PM",Pranathi, Book plus maybe a cold drink?
9380,"01/07/18, 4:15:29 PM",Sush, We went this morning!

9387,"01/07/18, 4:18:31 PM",Sush, She starts off with her set and then goes on to announce that she’s quitting comedy
9388,"01/07/18, 4:18:33 PM",Sush, It’s amazing
9389,"01/07/18, 4:18:41 PM",Sush, She’s so raw and vulnerable and real

9641,"03/07/18, 12:12:15 AM",Pranathi," So I told her I'll drop by tomorrow. She was very curt and said ""okay"" only. Insti profs and their egos... Cannot able to handle haha."

9723,"04/07/18, 2:17:19 AM",Sush, Even misplaced sense of pride that they grew a smart young scholar
9724,"04/07/18, 2:17:22 AM",Pranathi, And don't worry about R. You're number one bae till the end of time
9725,"04/07/18, 2:17:32 AM",Pranathi, I don't know. I don't think they're proud of me
9726,"04/07/18, 2:17:42 AM",Sush, They’re more jealous than proud
9727,"04/07/18, 2:17:51 AM",Pranathi, I told Milind my project and he was like hmmmmmmm really loudly
9728,"04/07/18, 2:17:55 AM",Pranathi," And then said, what else?"
9729,"04/07/18, 2:17:59 AM",Pranathi, I felt so dumb
9730,"04/07/18, 2:17:59 AM",Sush, You’re competition rather than their product

9734,"04/07/18, 2:18:31 AM",Pranathi," Kalpana was all like, why would you choose Sociology?"
9735,"04/07/18, 2:18:37 AM",Pranathi, Why not Anthro?
9736,"04/07/18, 2:18:53 AM",Sush, Eh?
9737,"04/07/18, 2:18:58 AM",Pranathi, And I was like well if you'd all been this helpful when I was applying maybe my life would've been different
9738,"04/07/18, 2:19:02 AM",Sush, So hung up on boundaries also
9739,"04/07/18, 2:19:03 AM",Pranathi, She doesn't like sociology it seems

9922,"06/07/18, 2:26:22 PM",Pranathi, I just got so sick of her dumb voice
9923,"06/07/18, 2:26:24 PM",Sush, Ya it’s brutal!
9924,"06/07/18, 2:26:26 PM",Sush, Lolol

9926,"06/07/18, 2:27:14 PM",Sush, Thighs are hurting from day 1 lol
9927,"06/07/18, 2:27:15 PM",Pranathi, You know that Popsugar fitness?
9928,"06/07/18, 2:27:20 PM",Sush, Ya!
9929,"06/07/18, 2:27:28 PM",Pranathi, They have more pointed exercises for parts of the body also
9930,"06/07/18, 2:27:33 PM",Pranathi, I like because they have like five min exercise videos
9931,"06/07/18, 2:27:39 PM",Pranathi, More at my level lolol
9932,"06/07/18, 2:27:40 PM",Pranathi, 
9933,"06/07/18, 2:27:53 PM",Pranathi," Anyway, interview!"
9934,"[06/07/18, 2:28:00 PM",Sush, ‎image omitted
9935,"06/07/18, 2:28:07 PM",Sush, Ya tell!
9936,"06/07/18, 2:28:09 PM",Pranathi, He was decent only! He didn't make me feel weird. He was like going on and on about his own autobiography lol
9937,"06/07/18, 2:28:17 PM",Sush, 😅
9938,"06/07/18, 2:28:20 PM",Pranathi," Which was interesting but I was also like okay, pls stop so I can ask other kostins"
9939,"06/07/18, 2:28:25 PM",Pranathi, But he answered all of them.
9940,"06/07/18, 2:28:38 PM",Pranathi," He said his stance is not ""pro Dalit but pro equality"""
9941,"06/07/18, 2:28:44 PM",Pranathi, So he actually hates the whole Brahmin hating thing
9942,"06/07/18, 2:28:50 PM",Pranathi, Which I found super interesting
9943,"06/07/18, 2:28:57 PM",Sush, Interesting
9944,"06/07/18, 2:28:57 PM",Pranathi, He said a lot of political people hate him
9945,"06/07/18, 2:29:17 PM",Pranathi," And he was like yaya, Carnatic is very beautiful"
9946,"06/07/18, 2:29:25 PM",Pranathi, The problem is that it's been institutionalized
9947,"06/07/18, 2:29:34 PM",Pranathi," That is its boon and its curse, he said"
9948,"06/07/18, 2:29:41 PM",Sush, Ooh
9949,"06/07/18, 2:29:46 PM",Sush, Quite sensible sounding
9950,"06/07/18, 2:29:53 PM",Sush, In terms of the music
9951,"06/07/18, 2:29:56 PM",Pranathi, I think he meant to say that Carnatic has been extremely centralized
9952,"06/07/18, 2:30:11 PM",Pranathi," And that if it could be decentralized, there's nothing wrong with the form"
9953,"06/07/18, 2:30:22 PM",Pranathi, Which is different from what other people say like it's too Sanskritized and all
9954,"06/07/18, 2:30:29 PM",Pranathi, But this guy has crazy eclectic influences
9955,"06/07/18, 2:30:36 PM",Pranathi," We spoke about Hindustani, jazz, hiphop"
9956,"06/07/18, 2:31:04 PM",Pranathi," And same politically also. He speaks about Ambedkar, Mandela, and Malcolm X all in the same breath."
9957,"06/07/18, 2:31:10 PM",Pranathi," Which sounds a little garbled, but it's also to see what he's getting at"
9958,"06/07/18, 2:34:25 PM",Sush, so fascinating!
9959,"06/07/18, 2:34:31 PM",Sush," sorry, i ran into someone"
9960,"06/07/18, 2:34:40 PM",Sush, he sounds so dynamic
9961,"06/07/18, 2:35:02 PM",Pranathi, Yeah. I think some of his thinking is still a little unclear
9962,"06/07/18, 2:35:06 PM",Pranathi, He was contradicting himself in places
9963,"06/07/18, 2:35:11 PM",Pranathi, But it's fascinating nonetheless
9964,"06/07/18, 2:35:30 PM",Pranathi, Apparently he went from being a hiphop producer in London to being homeless in Chennai
9965,"06/07/18, 2:35:34 PM",Pranathi, Until a few years ago
9966,"06/07/18, 2:35:46 PM",Sush, whoa 😳
9967,"06/07/18, 2:35:52 PM",Pranathi," The only thing I could think of then was, ""Fame is a fickle friend, Harry."""
9968,"06/07/18, 2:36:58 PM",Sush, Celebrity is as celebrity does!
9969,"06/07/18, 2:37:01 PM",Sush, 😂
9970,"06/07/18, 2:37:23 PM",Pranathi, Hahaha
9971,"06/07/18, 2:37:34 PM",Pranathi, Where you're going?

9973,"06/07/18, 2:38:04 PM",Sush, Going to crerar now
9974,"06/07/18, 2:38:18 PM",Sush, Trying to make a routine to apply aggressively
9975,"06/07/18, 2:44:46 PM",Pranathi, Niiiice
9976,"06/07/18, 2:44:50 PM",Pranathi, Go do chamathaa
9977,"06/07/18, 2:44:53 PM",Pranathi, I will go to sleep
9978,"06/07/18, 2:44:57 PM",Pranathi, Interviewing Deva tomorrow!
9979,"06/07/18, 2:47:18 PM",Sush, Deva is who?
9980,"06/07/18, 2:47:39 PM",Pranathi," Music composer, original gaana dude"
9981,"06/07/18, 2:47:49 PM",Sush, oh yes i recall

10002,"07/07/18, 9:32:33 PM",Sush, whaaaat
10003,"07/07/18, 9:32:55 PM",Pranathi, I was in an arcade where they were educating us on the screens about the universe
10004,"07/07/18, 9:33:02 PM",Pranathi, And how insignificant our planet is compared to theirs
10005,"07/07/18, 9:33:41 PM",Sush, 😅

10050,"08/07/18, 10:45:46 AM",Pranathi, She hates cooking 
10051,"08/07/18, 10:45:56 AM",Pranathi, Also she was cooking some chicken fish and all so I didn't even know how to help her
10052,"08/07/18, 10:46:05 AM",Pranathi," It was turning white apparently, and she was like, ""Is this normal?"""
10053,"08/07/18, 10:46:16 AM",Pranathi, I wasn't sure because none of the food we cook really turns white when it's getting cooked. 
10054,"08/07/18, 10:49:30 AM",Sush, Lolol!
10055,"08/07/18, 10:49:57 AM",Sush, That boyfriend is behaving better?
10056,"08/07/18, 10:50:15 AM",Pranathi," Ugh not really. Well, he's being nice in the short term but she says she knows she can't expect it forever"
10057,"08/07/18, 10:50:39 AM",Pranathi, He's not happy there (in America) so he's clinging on to her for the first time instead of being standoffish and toxically masculine
10058,"08/07/18, 10:50:47 AM",Pranathi, But she thinks it won't last when he goes to B school next year
10059,"08/07/18, 10:51:21 AM",Sush, Ugh he sounds terrible
10060,"08/07/18, 11:36:58 AM",Pranathi, Lol he is
10061,"08/07/18, 11:37:01 AM",Pranathi, Just finished meeting habba
10062,"08/07/18, 11:37:12 AM",Pranathi, Josh uses so many looooong sentences lol
10063,"08/07/18, 11:38:18 AM",Sush, 😂
10064,"08/07/18, 11:38:31 AM",Sush, Like yeah yeah understood
10065,"08/07/18, 11:41:18 AM",Pranathi, Haha yessss
10066,"08/07/18, 11:41:22 AM",Pranathi, What are you doing?
10067,"08/07/18, 11:41:39 AM",Sush, nothing rn
10068,"08/07/18, 11:41:43 AM",Sush, watching dear white people
10069,"08/07/18, 11:42:07 AM",Pranathi, Oh okay
10070,"08/07/18, 11:42:16 AM",Sush, i'm starting to get bored lol
10071,"08/07/18, 11:42:18 AM",Pranathi, I think I scared this Nitya into thinking she might have salmonella
10072,"08/07/18, 11:42:24 AM",Sush, what is salmonella?!
10073,"08/07/18, 11:42:25 AM",Pranathi, She said she has a bad stomach after eating her food
10074,"08/07/18, 11:42:31 AM",Pranathi, I asked if she washed her spinach and she said no
10075,"08/07/18, 11:42:37 AM",Sush, ohhhh
10076,"08/07/18, 11:42:38 AM",Sush, hahaha
10077,"08/07/18, 11:42:39 AM",Sush, yeah
10078,"08/07/18, 11:42:41 AM",Pranathi, What is salmonella ah? That bacteria haha
10079,"08/07/18, 11:42:46 AM",Sush, must wash that spinach
10080,"08/07/18, 11:42:58 AM",Sush, ohh diarrhoea causing thign?
10081,"08/07/18, 11:44:03 AM",Pranathi, Yep yep
10082,"08/07/18, 11:44:09 AM",Pranathi, It causes food poisoning
10083,"08/07/18, 11:44:18 AM",Pranathi," I feel like as a hypochondriac, I'm a terrible friend"
10084,"08/07/18, 12:27:30 PM",Sush, 😅 I mean it’s easy to tell if you have diarrhoea or not fortunately!
10085,"08/07/18, 12:27:36 PM",Sush, Not much left to the imagination
10086,"08/07/18, 12:27:40 PM",Pranathi, Haha
10087,"08/07/18, 12:27:44 PM",Pranathi, My mom is stressing me the fuck out
10088,"08/07/18, 12:28:05 PM",Pranathi, My dad and I had an argument yesterday. I said I kinda want to take the scooter for fieldwork because I'm spending so much on Ubers
10089,"08/07/18, 12:28:17 PM",Pranathi," It was just some offhand thought, I was thinking out loud"
10090,"08/07/18, 12:28:38 PM",Pranathi," My dad got so angry so quickly and was making this inane arguments, raising his voice about how I don't have learner's permit and shit"
10091,"08/07/18, 12:28:51 PM",Sush, Ayyo 
10092,"08/07/18, 12:28:57 PM",Pranathi," And I said something about him being angry for no reason, which made him get angrier. My mom just stood there silently the whole time"
10093,"08/07/18, 12:29:11 PM",Pranathi, Now today she comes and tells me that I am hurting my dad's feelings
10094,"08/07/18, 12:29:26 PM",Sush, Whaaat 
10095,"08/07/18, 12:29:31 PM",Pranathi, That I need to be more careful about my tone with him
10096,"08/07/18, 12:29:34 PM",Sush, That seems unfair
10097,"08/07/18, 12:30:04 PM",Pranathi, Yeah and when I said that she started sort of sniffling and feeling all sorry for herself because apparently she's the only one watching out for the family or some crap
10098,"08/07/18, 12:30:23 PM",Sush, Ayyo! I hateeee when they do that
10099,"08/07/18, 12:30:31 PM",Sush, It’s infuriating and self aggrandising
10100,"08/07/18, 12:31:36 PM",Pranathi, Yeah. I told her that it sucks that she wants me to just fake being happy about everything he does and says
10101,"08/07/18, 12:31:48 PM",Pranathi," She was like, ""Anyway you're leaving in a few weeks, why can't you?"""
10102,"08/07/18, 12:32:09 PM",Sush, omg this is literally the problem
10103,"08/07/18, 12:32:15 PM",Sush, Sweep everything under the carpet
10104,"08/07/18, 12:32:21 PM",Sush, Never talk about shit
10105,"08/07/18, 12:32:33 PM",Sush, Ripe for unhealthy relationships when you’re older
10106,"08/07/18, 12:32:42 PM",Pranathi," And it's always like, let's spare appa's feelings. Let's all learn how to step around his feelings and his temper and his ego"
10107,"08/07/18, 12:33:23 PM",Pranathi, Like why?! I literally said that about how I don't want him getting to be an older man who is egotistical and intolerant of criticism. And she got upset saying I was painting him in such a terrible light and how could I do that
10108,"08/07/18, 12:33:31 PM",Pranathi, I want to scream.
10109,"08/07/18, 12:33:36 PM",Sush, Ughhhhh
10110,"08/07/18, 12:33:41 PM",Sush, This whole false idea of respect
10111,"08/07/18, 12:35:22 PM",Pranathi, My brother doesn't even stand up for me
10112,"08/07/18, 12:35:25 PM",Pranathi, Not even in private
10113,"08/07/18, 12:35:30 PM",Pranathi, I even told him that
10114,"08/07/18, 12:35:40 PM",Pranathi, And he just got really defensive and said there's nothing for him to say
10115,"08/07/18, 12:35:45 PM",Pranathi, Ugh
10116,"08/07/18, 12:36:06 PM",Sush, That sucks man 
10117,"08/07/18, 12:36:20 PM",Pranathi, I worry that he's becoming toxically masculine too.
10118,"08/07/18, 12:36:45 PM",Pranathi," We had some argument about gender the other day and he didn't say a word. When I asked him why he was silent, pointed out that that was complicity, he just sat there."
10119,"08/07/18, 12:36:51 PM",Pranathi, It was so infuriating.
10120,"08/07/18, 12:37:14 PM",Sush, That is troubling!
10121,"08/07/18, 12:37:16 PM",Pranathi, I feel really distant from the three of them. Like I'm some cuckoo who has radical ideas and is muddying up the gene pool lol
10122,"08/07/18, 12:37:37 PM",Pranathi, They don't like my project at all. I can tell.
10123,"08/07/18, 12:37:55 PM",Sush, Because it raises uncomfortable questions?
10124,"08/07/18, 12:38:00 PM",Pranathi, I said something about some maami who comes home behaving in TamBrahm ways and my mom said I was being a bigot
10125,"08/07/18, 12:38:09 PM",Pranathi, That I was unfairly judging people and labeling them.
10126,"08/07/18, 12:38:20 PM",Pranathi," Yeah, pretty much. It puts them on the defensive and they'd rather not hear it."
10127,"08/07/18, 12:38:33 PM",Sush, Yeah I can 100% imagine
10128,"08/07/18, 12:38:41 PM",Sush, My dad would reach the same way
10129,"08/07/18, 12:39:01 PM",Pranathi," They won't say it to me, but it's causing a rift and that really worries me."
10130,"08/07/18, 12:39:11 PM",Pranathi," Because of course it's my job to make myself palatable to them, not the other way around."
10131,"08/07/18, 12:39:33 PM",Pranathi," I dunno, maybe this was a bad idea to do this project to begin with. Just with everything at home."
10132,"08/07/18, 12:40:55 PM",Sush," I mean, they’re going to have to find a way to be on board no?"
10133,"08/07/18, 12:41:51 PM",Pranathi," I guess, but they're not trying very hard."
10134,"08/07/18, 12:42:21 PM",Pranathi," My mom today, with her whole speech. She was basically conveying the message that I should try harder to just go along with them and not make myself noticeably radical."
10135,"08/07/18, 12:42:44 PM",Pranathi," Especially before vacation. Like, ""Please don't ruin our vacation."""
10136,"08/07/18, 12:42:53 PM",Pranathi," ""Appa's so excited, don't ruin it for him."""
10137,"08/07/18, 12:42:54 PM",Sush, ugh that is so unfair
10138,"08/07/18, 12:43:00 PM",Sush, You don’t have to listen to her though
10139,"08/07/18, 12:43:11 PM",Sush, I know it’s super hard
10140,"08/07/18, 12:43:20 PM",Sush, But I feel like conflicts will happen anyway
10141,"08/07/18, 12:43:28 PM",Sush, For some reason or other
10142,"08/07/18, 12:43:39 PM",Sush, Might as well not waste time and energy minimising yourself
10143,"08/07/18, 12:44:08 PM",Sush, Because it isn’t going to actually stave off conflict
10144,"08/07/18, 12:45:11 PM",Pranathi, Yeah
10145,"08/07/18, 12:45:26 PM",Pranathi, Rebecca asked me how it was going and I mentioned the bare minimum of all this stuff
10146,"08/07/18, 12:45:36 PM",Pranathi," She goes, ""They're crazies, I'm sorry"""
10147,"08/07/18, 12:45:58 PM",Pranathi," And in spite of all this, I don't want to speak about them that way. It was so annoying she took the liberty to say that even though I know she means well."
10148,"08/07/18, 12:46:39 PM",Pranathi," Anyway, I guess they're not really going to change themselves for me so I just have to expect conflict."
10149,"08/07/18, 12:48:17 PM",Sush, that's annoying of her!
10150,"08/07/18, 12:48:35 PM",Sush, idk - is it just inevitable for conflict to break out in close quarters?
10151,"08/07/18, 12:48:43 PM",Sush, i wonder what families it doesn't happen in look like
10152,"08/07/18, 12:48:58 PM",Sush," it's so annoying and infuriating, i'm sorry you're in the midst of it now "
10153,"08/07/18, 12:51:30 PM",Pranathi, I don't think so. I imagine there must be some functional families out there no?
10154,"08/07/18, 12:51:33 PM",Pranathi," I hope, anyway"
10155,"08/07/18, 12:52:00 PM",Pranathi, It's okay. I think I just have to remember this for next time and seriously get another apartment or something.
10156,"08/07/18, 12:52:18 PM",Sush, do you think it affects your dad less than your mom thinks?
10157,"08/07/18, 12:52:31 PM",Sush, like it's between you and him - her intervention makes it worse?
10158,"08/07/18, 12:53:01 PM",Pranathi," I think it isn't great between us. I'm noticing how averse to criticism my dad is, and how sensitive he is to comments."
10159,"08/07/18, 12:53:15 PM",Pranathi," And he won't talk about it, but he'll show it by snapping at me for something completely irrelevant."
10160,"08/07/18, 12:53:25 PM",Pranathi, Which is so toxically masculine
10161,"08/07/18, 12:53:29 PM",Pranathi, And it infuriates me more
10162,"08/07/18, 12:53:32 PM",Sush, ugh i know exactly what you mean
10163,"08/07/18, 12:53:46 PM",Pranathi, But my mom is making it even worse by coming between us
10164,"08/07/18, 12:54:00 PM",Pranathi, And then telling me to just drop the criticism of dad altogether
10165,"08/07/18, 12:54:04 PM",Sush, yeah...
10166,"08/07/18, 12:54:07 PM",Pranathi," Because I resent her, and I resent him more"
10167,"08/07/18, 12:54:15 PM",Sush, 
10168,"08/07/18, 12:54:15 PM",Pranathi, And that's a horrible feeling to have
10169,"08/07/18, 12:54:19 PM",Sush, for sure
10170,"08/07/18, 12:57:04 PM",Pranathi, It's okay. I think I'm just going to keep my project stuff to myself
10171,"08/07/18, 12:58:58 PM",Pranathi, Am I blowing this out of proportion?
10172,"08/07/18, 1:14:22 PM",Sush," no, you're not!"
10173,"08/07/18, 1:14:33 PM",Sush, i'd feel the same way
10174,"08/07/18, 1:14:43 PM",Sush," sorry, mom called"
10175,"08/07/18, 1:23:13 PM",Pranathi, No worries!
10176,"08/07/18, 1:23:20 PM",Pranathi, I think I should just go to sleep
10177,"08/07/18, 1:23:23 PM",Sush, How are you feeling?
10178,"08/07/18, 1:23:25 PM",Pranathi, I'm driving myself up the wall about this
10179,"08/07/18, 1:23:39 PM",Pranathi, *thinking about
10180,"08/07/18, 1:23:45 PM",Sush, Fair 
10181,"08/07/18, 1:23:51 PM",Pranathi, Not great. I think my mom is being manipulative
10182,"08/07/18, 1:23:59 PM",Pranathi, And I think it's really unfair and it bugs me
10183,"08/07/18, 1:24:18 PM",Pranathi, But I don't know what to do about it except say to myself it's not going to affect me
10184,"08/07/18, 1:24:22 PM",Pranathi, Even though it does
10185,"08/07/18, 1:24:33 PM",Sush, It is unfair to expect that everyone pander to the biggest male ego in the room
10186,"08/07/18, 1:24:48 PM",Pranathi, Yeah. I can't even talk to her about the gender aspect
10187,"08/07/18, 1:24:53 PM",Pranathi, She'll just say I'm making it up
10188,"08/07/18, 1:25:33 PM",Sush, True 
10189,"08/07/18, 1:26:19 PM",Sush, and it’ll sound far out radical in a way that gets their backs job
10190,"08/07/18, 1:26:26 PM",Sush, *backs up
10191,"08/07/18, 1:43:08 PM",Pranathi, Yeah
10192,"08/07/18, 1:43:12 PM",Pranathi, Okay must sleep now
10193,"08/07/18, 1:43:18 PM",Pranathi, I love you and thanks for listening to me vent!
10194,"08/07/18, 1:43:20 PM",Pranathi, ❤
10195,"08/07/18, 1:43:26 PM",Pranathi, Have a lovely day
10196,"09/07/18, 10:52:07 AM",Pranathi, Dude West Bengal really needs to get its act together lol
10197,"09/07/18, 1:05:32 PM",Sush, lolol
10198,"09/07/18, 1:05:36 PM",Sush, siliguri?

10202,"10/07/18, 10:36:58 AM",Pranathi," Helloooo! Yes yes, it's so beautiful here"
10203,"10/07/18, 10:37:16 AM",Pranathi, Except I don't get reception unless I come to lobby so I cannot able to respond or see texts!
10204,"10/07/18, 10:37:20 AM",Pranathi, How are youuuuu
10205,"10/07/18, 10:39:10 AM",Sush, So niiiicee

10209,"10/07/18, 10:40:09 AM",Pranathi, And apologies if I'm very slow to respond
10210,"10/07/18, 10:40:14 AM",Sush, Just continuing to chill
10211,"10/07/18, 10:40:17 AM",Sush, No worriesss
10212,"10/07/18, 10:40:16 AM",Pranathi, Even wifi is cranky
10213,"10/07/18, 10:40:23 AM",Sush, It’ll be nice to cut off also no
10214,"10/07/18, 10:40:37 AM",Pranathi, Yeah I thought I'd just sit here in the lobby for 10 mins to check email
10215,"10/07/18, 10:40:55 AM",Pranathi, We have book chapter work so that's the one thing I need to check phone for
10216,"10/07/18, 10:41:03 AM",Pranathi, But once I go back to my room anyway there's no wifi
10217,"10/07/18, 10:41:10 AM",Sush, Ohh okok

10239,"10/07/18, 10:43:34 AM",Pranathi, There's some Tam fellows sitting here bemoaning lack of signal

10284,"12/07/18, 8:55:33 PM",Sush, They didn’t let me go to the pool because my membership as a student expired 🤬
10285,"12/07/18, 8:55:45 PM",Sush, and then I ate a ton of chocolate and pita chips and Maggi

10290,"12/07/18, 10:50:05 PM",Pranathi, I'm also pretty grumpy. I have a bad stomach from eating something like some lame NRI
10291,"12/07/18, 10:50:22 PM",Pranathi, And I've been throwing up
10292,"12/07/18, 10:50:43 PM",Pranathi, So this car drive down the mountain has not been fun
10293,"12/07/18, 10:51:30 PM",Pranathi," Haven't upchucked from the car yet, so trying to stay asleep to prevent that from happening"
10294,"12/07/18, 10:51:31 PM",Pranathi, But Gangtok was really really beautiful

10310,"13/07/18, 10:33:33 AM",Pranathi, In close quarters
10311,"13/07/18, 10:33:42 AM",Pranathi, I'm getting snappy about everything
10312,"13/07/18, 10:33:58 AM",Sush, i can imagine!
10313,"13/07/18, 10:34:07 AM",Sush, holidays are also 24/7 family

10322,"[13/07/18, 10:41:13 AM",Pranathi, ‎image omitted
10323,"13/07/18, 10:41:28 AM",Pranathi, I finished Serious Men and Open City.
10324,"13/07/18, 10:41:49 AM",Sush, so cute! and lol @ army thing
10325,"13/07/18, 10:42:00 AM",Sush, so beautiful!!
10326,"13/07/18, 10:42:06 AM",Sush, ooh i'm just about 15% through
10327,"13/07/18, 10:42:25 AM",Pranathi, My mom insisted on wearing her coat PLUS shawl even though it was only like 12 degrees out and I had to not facepalm
10328,"13/07/18, 10:42:31 AM",Sush, 😂
10329,"13/07/18, 10:42:43 AM",Sush, look at you and your little denim jacket ❤
10330,"13/07/18, 10:42:44 AM",Pranathi, It's a weirdly disjointed book no?
10331,"13/07/18, 10:42:50 AM",Pranathi, Hahaha ❤
10332,"13/07/18, 10:42:53 AM",Sush, it is!
10333,"13/07/18, 10:43:01 AM",Sush, it feels very _male_ so far
10334,"13/07/18, 10:43:13 AM",Sush, ooh how did you like Serious Men?
10335,"13/07/18, 10:43:19 AM",Pranathi, I only wore it because mom insisted that I not die of pneumonia
10336,"13/07/18, 10:43:26 AM",Sush, hahaha
10337,"13/07/18, 10:43:38 AM",Pranathi, It is very very male and I seriously abhorred the protagonist by the end
10338,"13/07/18, 10:43:48 AM",Pranathi, Not to prejudice but I imagine you'll come to the same conclusion
10339,"13/07/18, 10:43:59 AM",Sush, i can see it coming
10340,"13/07/18, 10:44:04 AM",Pranathi, The only other contemporary Nigerian author I've read is Chimamanda
10341,"13/07/18, 10:44:11 AM",Sush, same
10342,"13/07/18, 10:44:12 AM",Pranathi, And I never like her protagonists either
10343,"13/07/18, 10:44:16 AM",Sush, haha yeah
10344,"13/07/18, 10:44:17 AM",Pranathi, I just can't identify with them
10345,"13/07/18, 10:44:19 AM",Sush, esp in americannah
10346,"13/07/18, 10:44:26 AM",Pranathi, Yeahhh especially that one
10347,"13/07/18, 10:44:34 AM",Sush, i think i liked the one in purple hibiscus
10348,"13/07/18, 10:44:42 AM",Pranathi," Then I realized Teju Cole and her are friends, he thanks her in the acks"
10349,"13/07/18, 10:45:13 AM",Sush, ohhhh
10350,"13/07/18, 10:45:18 AM",Pranathi, Yeah that was a lovely book. So steeped in detail
10351,"13/07/18, 10:45:34 AM",Pranathi, This book is so pompous and I don't care for the circularity of the writing style
10352,"13/07/18, 10:45:48 AM",Pranathi, Every time he mentioned some opera I wanted to shoot him
10353,"13/07/18, 10:45:52 AM",Sush, I KNOW
10354,"13/07/18, 10:45:55 AM",Sush, so much...exposition
10355,"[13/07/18, 10:46:31 AM",Pranathi, ‎image omitted
10356,"13/07/18, 10:46:40 AM",Sush, omg YAK ❤ ❤ ❤
10357,"13/07/18, 10:47:06 AM",Pranathi, Dude this place is so beautiful. I'm surprised at my family for picking such an... adventurous spot
10358,"13/07/18, 10:47:09 AM",Sush, are they smelly?!
10359,"13/07/18, 10:47:13 AM",Pranathi, Near Nathula we had to even hike a little
10360,"13/07/18, 10:47:18 AM",Sush, so nice!
10361,"13/07/18, 10:47:21 AM",Pranathi, Yeah erumamaadu types
10362,"13/07/18, 10:47:29 AM",Pranathi, Their poop is sfinkh
10363,"13/07/18, 10:47:29 AM",Sush, 😂
10364,"13/07/18, 10:47:31 AM",Pranathi, Stinky
10365,"13/07/18, 10:47:44 AM",Pranathi, And Serious Men! I really liked how quickly it read
10366,"13/07/18, 10:47:52 AM",Pranathi, I started reading it this afternoon and I'm done
10367,"13/07/18, 10:48:12 AM",Pranathi, But it's also interesting and unsettling some of this Ayyan Mani's thoughts
10368,"13/07/18, 10:48:15 AM",Pranathi, Reminded me of JJ
10369,"13/07/18, 10:48:29 AM",Sush, ya!!
10370,"13/07/18, 10:48:32 AM",Pranathi, What did you think of it?
10371,"13/07/18, 10:48:36 AM",Sush, i liked it a lot
10372,"13/07/18, 10:48:42 AM",Sush, i read it many years ago
10373,"13/07/18, 10:48:52 AM",Sush, so i only remember broad story
10374,"13/07/18, 10:49:08 AM",Sush, even ayyan mani's kid's plot is fascinating
10375,"13/07/18, 10:49:21 AM",Pranathi, Yeah I reeeeally like that. The whole play on handicap and genius
10376,"13/07/18, 10:49:25 AM",Sush, yeah!
10377,"13/07/18, 10:49:51 AM",Pranathi, I also like how Ayyan and the Acharya character end up colluding
10378,"13/07/18, 10:50:06 AM",Sush, yaa! i didn't really see that coming
10379,"13/07/18, 10:50:09 AM",Pranathi, It ends up being this weird marriage of convenience and grudging respect
10380,"13/07/18, 10:50:15 AM",Sush, correct!
10381,"13/07/18, 10:50:18 AM",Pranathi, It was counterintuitive
10382,"13/07/18, 10:50:26 AM",Pranathi, But also so clearly there all along!
10383,"13/07/18, 10:50:33 AM",Sush, acharya's affair is so awks
10384,"13/07/18, 10:50:37 AM",Pranathi, Soooo awks
10385,"13/07/18, 10:50:43 AM",Pranathi, It made me very uncomfortable to read
10386,"13/07/18, 10:50:50 AM",Sush, yeah 
10387,"13/07/18, 10:50:54 AM",Pranathi, Especially the description of the sex scene which honestly was rape
10388,"13/07/18, 10:51:03 AM",Pranathi, And it scared me tbh
10389,"13/07/18, 10:51:16 AM",Sush, no???
10390,"13/07/18, 10:51:23 AM",Pranathi, She doesn't say once that she likes it or even consents
10391,"13/07/18, 10:51:32 AM",Pranathi, And he's like forcing her. He's her dad's she
10392,"13/07/18, 10:51:33 AM",Pranathi, She
10393,"13/07/18, 10:51:36 AM",Pranathi, Age
10394,"13/07/18, 10:51:45 AM",Pranathi, To me that is terrrrrifying
10395,"13/07/18, 10:51:46 AM",Sush, v v unsettling
10396,"13/07/18, 10:52:10 AM",Sush, ugh apparently sadanand menon was in a 'relationship' with someone in the dept
10397,"13/07/18, 10:52:10 AM",Pranathi, And the only reason he concedes is because of his bruised ego that she's been ignoring him
10398,"13/07/18, 10:52:32 AM",Pranathi, It just made me despise men more
10399,"13/07/18, 10:52:39 AM",Pranathi, Ughhhh ours or ACJ?
10400,"13/07/18, 10:52:41 AM",Sush, this acharya is a hideous embodiment of straight male brahmin privilege
10401,"13/07/18, 10:52:48 AM",Sush, ours
10402,"13/07/18, 10:52:55 AM",Pranathi, A student?
10403,"13/07/18, 10:53:03 AM",Sush, apparently
10404,"13/07/18, 10:53:06 AM",Sush, no idea who
10405,"13/07/18, 10:54:16 AM",Pranathi, Damn I find that so creepy
10406,"13/07/18, 10:54:21 AM",Pranathi, I knew him before insti
10407,"13/07/18, 10:54:27 AM",Sush, oh yeah?
10408,"13/07/18, 10:54:40 AM",Pranathi, I was part of some dance documentary for my teacher
10409,"13/07/18, 10:54:47 AM",Pranathi, So we spent a few days filming in Spaces
10410,"13/07/18, 10:54:51 AM",Sush, ohhh
10411,"13/07/18, 10:54:53 AM",Pranathi, And she and Sadanand were very close
10412,"13/07/18, 10:55:09 AM",Pranathi, It's weird but not surprising to see this stuff come out about him
10413,"13/07/18, 10:55:21 AM",Pranathi, I honestly just don't trust men
10414,"13/07/18, 10:55:35 AM",Pranathi," Even reading the Acharya bit, I was like ofc he would"
10415,"13/07/18, 10:55:43 AM",Sush, yeah 
10416,"13/07/18, 10:55:50 AM",Pranathi, I hated how he described signs of his wife aging
10417,"13/07/18, 10:55:57 AM",Pranathi, It was so misogynistic
10418,"13/07/18, 10:56:00 AM",Sush, they give us exactly 0 reasons to trust / respect them
10419,"13/07/18, 10:56:02 AM",Sush, i knowwwww
10420,"13/07/18, 10:56:19 AM",Sush, that reminded me of siddharth
10421,"13/07/18, 10:56:20 AM",Pranathi, It made me crave a woman author but even that doesn't really mean anything
10422,"13/07/18, 10:56:27 AM",Pranathi, Ew I hate Siddharth
10423,"13/07/18, 10:56:37 AM",Sush, i'm sure acharya was no looker
10424,"13/07/18, 10:56:44 AM",Sush, and never worked out a day in his life
10425,"13/07/18, 10:56:49 AM",Sush, or ironed his freaking clothes
10426,"13/07/18, 10:56:50 AM",Pranathi, Brb? Having dinner! Sorry
10427,"13/07/18, 10:56:54 AM",Pranathi, 💕
10428,"13/07/18, 10:57:01 AM",Sush, sure! 😘
10429,"13/07/18, 11:18:26 AM",Pranathi, Back!
10430,"13/07/18, 11:18:52 AM",Pranathi," Yeah, there's a point when Acharya's wife leaves off to Chennai and he's like ummm where do I get fresh underwear"
10431,"13/07/18, 11:19:24 AM",Pranathi, I was really annoyed by the silencing around women characters in that book. None of the chapters are told from any of the female characters' perspectives
10432,"13/07/18, 4:07:15 PM",Sush, Sorry I fell asleeeep
10433,"13/07/18, 4:07:22 PM",Sush, Ugh ya asshole

10443,"13/07/18, 9:39:51 PM",Pranathi, Seems like she is Delhi based

10448,"13/07/18, 9:40:13 PM",Sush, Haha!😘
10449,"13/07/18, 9:40:19 PM",Sush, Ugh I haven’t left the house
10450,"13/07/18, 9:40:21 PM",Pranathi, 💕
10451,"13/07/18, 9:40:31 PM",Pranathi, Nightly walk happening?
10452,"13/07/18, 9:40:37 PM",Sush, ya in ten
10453,"13/07/18, 9:40:47 PM",Pranathi, Oh good good. What was for dinner?
10454,"13/07/18, 9:41:05 PM",Sush, I had a really late lunch and a bunch of crap through the day
10455,"13/07/18, 9:41:08 PM",Pranathi, You cooked something yem yem
10456,"13/07/18, 9:41:14 PM",Sush, Naaah
10457,"13/07/18, 9:41:24 PM",Sush, I barely got out of bed today 🤦🏽‍♀️
10458,"13/07/18, 9:41:26 PM",Pranathi, Ohh got it. Yeah I've been eating so much crap
10459,"13/07/18, 9:41:32 PM",Sush, Not very fun 🦕
10460,"13/07/18, 9:41:49 PM",Sush, Did you enjoy he food in Gangtok??
10461,"13/07/18, 9:41:54 PM",Pranathi, Ugh I know those days. It feels luxurious until it doesn't and then you start feeling shitty
10462,"13/07/18, 9:42:01 PM",Sush, Exactlyyy
10463,"13/07/18, 9:42:25 PM",Sush, I think literally my body can’t handle it
10464,"13/07/18, 9:42:45 PM",Pranathi, It was decent! Our resort's food was incrediblyyyy overpriced. A plate of parathas with two pieces was 500 rupees
10465,"13/07/18, 9:42:53 PM",Pranathi, Plus it tasted like shite
10466,"13/07/18, 9:43:04 PM",Sush, I also like this 
10469,"13/07/18, 9:43:14 PM",Sush, Uggghhj
10470,"13/07/18, 9:43:20 PM",Sush, That’s the worst
10471,"13/07/18, 9:43:20 PM",Pranathi," So we had to go to the town for food, but that was like 45 mins away. When we did also it was street food mainly"
10472,"13/07/18, 9:43:26 PM",Pranathi," Which I love, momos and all"
10473,"13/07/18, 9:43:33 PM",Pranathi, And this giant momo called Tai pho
10474,"13/07/18, 9:43:37 PM",Sush, Ooh!
10475,"13/07/18, 9:43:38 PM",Pranathi, But it really messed with my stomach
10476,"13/07/18, 9:43:44 PM",Sush, Ayyo I can imagine
10477,"13/07/18, 9:43:54 PM",Sush, Eat gentle home food now
10478,"13/07/18, 9:44:03 PM",Pranathi," We went to this lovely cafe tho, which overlooked Kanchenjunga!"
10479,"13/07/18, 9:44:16 PM",Sush, Ohh so nice!
10480,"13/07/18, 9:44:25 PM",Pranathi, It was called Bakers Cafe and it has the loveliest honey lemon ginger tea
10481,"13/07/18, 9:44:30 PM",Sush, 😍
10482,"13/07/18, 9:44:51 PM",Sush, Our maid in cal - Pari made greaaaat lemon tea 😍
10483,"13/07/18, 9:45:08 PM",Pranathi," Yeah my body feels wasted when I don't have some movement, totally understand. I feel so under the weather when I lay in bed"
10484,"13/07/18, 9:45:15 PM",Pranathi, I wonder if our brains connect it with sickness
10485,"13/07/18, 9:45:20 PM",Sush, Possibly
10486,"13/07/18, 9:45:23 PM",Pranathi, Oooh yummy!
10487,"13/07/18, 9:45:25 PM",Sush, I just feel so gross
10488,"13/07/18, 9:45:42 PM",Pranathi, Ten minutes la go walk and it will all feel sorted out
10489,"13/07/18, 9:45:46 PM",Sush, So easy to sink into self pity also!
10490,"13/07/18, 9:50:14 PM",Pranathi, I love this list
10491,"13/07/18, 9:50:31 PM",Pranathi, I think you do a VERY good job of showing up for friends 💕
10492,"13/07/18, 9:50:37 PM",Pranathi, And I love you and miss you
10493,"13/07/18, 9:50:55 PM",Pranathi, Yeah it's so easy to sink into self pity. Go buy yourself some ice cream ♥️
10494,"13/07/18, 9:51:32 PM",Pranathi, It will make you happy happy!
10495,"13/07/18, 9:51:42 PM",Pranathi, I like this recipe club idea haha

10499,"13/07/18, 9:56:14 PM",Pranathi, Aww yay that makes me happy to hear! This list has some nice pointers also tho
10500,"13/07/18, 9:56:22 PM",Pranathi, Stuff I hadn't thought of but would like to do!
10501,"13/07/18, 9:56:25 PM",Sush, No? It’s so thoughtful and nice
10502,"13/07/18, 9:56:37 PM",Pranathi, Ayyo yeah I forgot about that. But that's less than ten days away now!
10503,"13/07/18, 9:56:57 PM",Sush, Yesss final stretch
10504,"13/07/18, 9:57:03 PM",Pranathi, What flavor you will buy when ice cream ban is lifted?
10505,"13/07/18, 9:57:16 PM",Sush, Sea salt caramel!!!!
10506,"13/07/18, 9:57:24 PM",Pranathi, Yaaaaaammmyyyyy
10507,"13/07/18, 9:57:28 PM",Sush, Pucca
10508,"13/07/18, 9:57:34 PM",Pranathi, You like sea salt caramel in other stuff also?
10509,"13/07/18, 9:57:38 PM",Pranathi, Like brownie?
10510,"[13/07/18, 9:57:55 PM",Sush, ‎image omitted
10511,"13/07/18, 9:58:00 PM",Pranathi, Oooh I totally forgot about this one recipe I have
10512,"13/07/18, 9:58:09 PM",Sush, I like sea salt caramel in anything!
10513,"13/07/18, 9:58:09 PM",Pranathi, Hi cutie 😘
10514,"13/07/18, 9:58:16 PM",Pranathi, You have such a pretty nose
10515,"13/07/18, 9:58:29 PM",Pranathi, Okay so I learned this one serving size molten lava cake recipe
10516,"13/07/18, 9:58:36 PM",Sush, Omg have I told you how my nose grew in adulthood
10517,"13/07/18, 9:58:43 PM",Pranathi, It is verrrrry easy. Chocolate cake with molten sea salt caramel center
10518,"13/07/18, 9:58:46 PM",Sush, Or at least after I was a teenager
10519,"13/07/18, 9:58:58 PM",Sush, Oh yammy! Pls make😍
10520,"13/07/18, 9:59:01 PM",Pranathi, It is most excellent with a dollop of vanilla ice cream and I think I must make it for us when I am back
10521,"13/07/18, 9:59:08 PM",Pranathi, Whaaat how it grew? Telling lies?
10522,"13/07/18, 9:59:10 PM",Sush, sounds amazeee
10523,"13/07/18, 9:59:23 PM",Sush, Maybe! I had a realllyyyy chappe mooku
10524,"13/07/18, 9:59:26 PM",Sush, Like non existent
10525,"13/07/18, 9:59:43 PM",Sush, then it grew a bit in my teenage years somehow
10526,"13/07/18, 10:00:03 PM",Pranathi, Omg that's so cute. I want to see chappe mooku Sush!
10527,"13/07/18, 10:00:15 PM",Sush, I’ll find baby photo
10528,"13/07/18, 10:00:18 PM",Pranathi, I also had chappe mooku but then I grew this kodamolaga looking one
10529,"13/07/18, 10:00:20 PM",Sush, No mooku at all
10530,"13/07/18, 10:00:26 PM",Pranathi, Which is not even nice so ugh what's the point
10531,"13/07/18, 10:00:37 PM",Sush, kodamolaga it seems 😂
10532,"13/07/18, 10:00:42 PM",Pranathi, I told my dad
10533,"13/07/18, 10:00:47 PM",Pranathi, That he gave me the ugliest nose
10534,"13/07/18, 10:00:55 PM",Pranathi, I think he felt sad. He hid his nose lol
10535,"13/07/18, 10:01:08 PM",Sush, 😂😂
10536,"13/07/18, 10:01:14 PM",Sush, Why you don’t like your nose
10537,"13/07/18, 10:01:25 PM",Sush, It’s a nice nose only!
10538,"13/07/18, 10:01:50 PM",Pranathi, It's an okayyyy nose
10539,"13/07/18, 10:02:02 PM",Pranathi, Mom has waaay cuter nose
10540,"13/07/18, 10:02:10 PM",Sush, Your mom is so small
10541,"13/07/18, 10:02:18 PM",Pranathi, No?
10542,"13/07/18, 10:02:26 PM",Pranathi, Gives me a complex lo
10543,"13/07/18, 10:02:27 PM",Pranathi, Lol
10544,"13/07/18, 10:02:37 PM",Sush, You are also tiny
10545,"13/07/18, 10:02:39 PM",Sush, See that photo
10546,"13/07/18, 10:02:52 PM",Pranathi, You should see her thighs tho man
10547,"13/07/18, 10:03:05 PM",Pranathi, They're like white people thighs
10548,"13/07/18, 10:03:32 PM",Pranathi, But it's sad because she's only that way since she has thyroidism
10549,"13/07/18, 10:03:36 PM",Sush, Ohhh
10550,"13/07/18, 10:03:40 PM",Sush, Paapa!
10551,"13/07/18, 10:03:40 PM",Pranathi, She doesn't even want to be so thin I think
10552,"13/07/18, 10:03:55 PM",Sush, I miss my depression weight 😭
10553,"13/07/18, 10:04:06 PM",Sush, Clothes fit me so easily
10554,"13/07/18, 10:04:13 PM",Pranathi, Haha don't say like thatttt
10555,"13/07/18, 10:04:21 PM",Pranathi, You're so much happier now and that counts for something
10556,"13/07/18, 10:04:31 PM",Pranathi, A lot of somethings
10557,"13/07/18, 10:04:41 PM",Pranathi, But also I hear you. Since coming back I've put on some four five kilos
10558,"13/07/18, 10:04:57 PM",Pranathi, I miss being able to watch my diet but at the same time I love home food
10559,"13/07/18, 10:05:01 PM",Sush, but I was so hot 😭
10560,"13/07/18, 10:05:13 PM",Sush, Stock up on Home food!
10561,"13/07/18, 10:05:12 PM",Pranathi, Why does being thin always have to be at a cost!
10562,"13/07/18, 10:05:17 PM",Pranathi," Happiness, food"
10563,"13/07/18, 10:05:22 PM",Sush, That will go off when you return
10564,"13/07/18, 10:05:25 PM",Pranathi, You are SOOOO
10566,"13/07/18, 10:05:45 PM",Pranathi, Perhaps hotter because you don't have circles round your eyes and laughter comes easily and all that
10567,"13/07/18, 10:05:58 PM",Sush, I acquired a jawline and collarbones for a brief period and lost them promptly
10568,"13/07/18, 10:11:30 PM",Pranathi, Haha both of which you still have
10569,"13/07/18, 10:11:39 PM",Pranathi, You are just seeing yourself with harsh goggles
10570,"13/07/18, 10:11:44 PM",Pranathi, Hoggles
10571,"13/07/18, 10:11:47 PM",Sush, buried under mounds of flesh!
10572,"13/07/18, 10:12:06 PM",Pranathi, No I refuse to let you see yourself like that
10573,"13/07/18, 10:12:13 PM",Pranathi, Imagine if you said that about me
10574,"[13/07/18, 10:12:22 PM",Sush, ‎image omitted
10575,"13/07/18, 10:12:25 PM",Pranathi, It would very hurtful
10576,"13/07/18, 10:12:31 PM",Pranathi, So you don't say about yourself also
10577,"13/07/18, 10:12:39 PM",Sush, Trueeeee
10578,"13/07/18, 10:12:43 PM",Sush, I’m just wallowing
10579,"13/07/18, 10:12:43 PM",Pranathi, Flowers so niceeeeee
10580,"13/07/18, 10:12:49 PM",Sush, Ok I will step out of the house
10581,"13/07/18, 10:12:51 PM",Pranathi, You bought?
10582,"13/07/18, 10:12:57 PM",Sush, Joanna brought!
10583,"13/07/18, 10:13:01 PM",Pranathi, Yes you must get out and breathe night air
10584,"13/07/18, 10:13:07 PM",Pranathi, She also seems to know how to show up
10585,"13/07/18, 10:13:09 PM",Pranathi, With flowers!
10586,"[13/07/18, 10:16:14 PM",Pranathi, ‎image omitted
10587,"13/07/18, 11:11:58 PM",Pranathi, I hear you're hanging out with Uday! ❤
10588,"14/07/18, 12:19:25 AM",Sush, Hiiiii
10589,"14/07/18, 12:19:37 AM",Sush, Yes I am hanging out with him tomorrow
10590,"14/07/18, 12:19:47 AM",Sush, 😊
10591,"14/07/18, 12:19:56 AM",Sush, Almost home now
10592,"14/07/18, 12:20:03 AM",Sush," Went for a walk, drank a beer"
10593,"14/07/18, 12:20:47 AM",Pranathi, Niiiiiice
10594,"14/07/18, 12:20:51 AM",Pranathi, Sounds lovely!
10595,"14/07/18, 12:20:55 AM",Pranathi, Where did you get beer?
10596,"14/07/18, 12:20:59 AM",Sush, Jimmy’s
10597,"14/07/18, 12:21:19 AM",Sush, We tried to go to Ida noyes but they close at 11 in the summer it seems
10598,"14/07/18, 12:21:29 AM",Pranathi, Oh lame Ida Noyes
10599,"14/07/18, 12:21:38 AM",Pranathi, I just spoke to Tara
10600,"14/07/18, 12:21:41 AM",Pranathi, Lol
10601,"14/07/18, 12:21:54 AM",Pranathi, It made me feel depressed slightly
10602,"14/07/18, 12:22:11 AM",Pranathi, Do you feel better now that you've been out?
10603,"14/07/18, 12:22:39 AM",Sush, Ayyo how is she
10604,"14/07/18, 12:22:44 AM",Sush, I do feel better!
10605,"14/07/18, 12:23:15 AM",Pranathi, She's annoying. I don't think we should be friends
10606,"14/07/18, 12:23:47 AM",Pranathi, She went out for dinner and drinks and all okay. I was trying to ask her about that but she got stuck on some story about work and watching the match and how fun it is to chat with some dude who's a trader
10607,"14/07/18, 12:24:06 AM",Pranathi," And then I told her about Sikkim and she was like, ""Nice nice, then what else?"" After I went on for like five mins"
10608,"14/07/18, 12:24:20 AM",Sush, Pah
10609,"14/07/18, 12:24:24 AM",Pranathi, She just has no imagination.
10610,"14/07/18, 12:24:29 AM",Pranathi, I pretended my mom was calling me and hung up
10611,"14/07/18, 12:24:40 AM",Pranathi, I feel slightly bad but also she's stopped making an effort too
10612,"14/07/18, 12:25:00 AM",Pranathi, I think maybe I was too obvious when she came to Chicago that I wasn't interested in her work life.
10613,"14/07/18, 12:25:04 AM",Sush, It sounds like you consistently feel worse after speaking to her as compared to before
10614,"14/07/18, 12:25:06 AM",Pranathi, And that's all she wanted to talk about
10615,"14/07/18, 12:25:16 AM",Pranathi, Yeah. That's a pretty bad sign no. She takes no interest in my life
10616,"14/07/18, 12:25:23 AM",Pranathi, Plus I get this sense that she thinks my work is crap
10617,"14/07/18, 12:25:34 AM",Sush, Have you tried telling her you feel like she takes no interest?
10618,"14/07/18, 12:25:52 AM",Sush, Obvs that’s no easy conversation
10619,"14/07/18, 12:26:05 AM",Pranathi," I feel bad for saying this, but I don't know if I care enough to have that conversation."
10620,"14/07/18, 12:26:17 AM",Pranathi, She just doesn't care about the same things that I do. And I don't care about the things that she does.
10621,"14/07/18, 12:26:29 AM",Pranathi, I don't want to hear her judgment of my research.
10622,"14/07/18, 12:26:37 AM",Sush, that's entirely fair
10623,"14/07/18, 12:26:39 AM",Pranathi, She tried to get into an argument with me about qualitative work.
10624,"14/07/18, 12:26:55 AM",Sush, 🤦🏽‍♀🤦🏽‍♀
10625,"14/07/18, 12:26:55 AM",Pranathi, And I don't want to hear it from her because it's aggravating after she ignores every other attempt to make conversation.
10626,"14/07/18, 12:27:08 AM",Sush, totally reasonable
10627,"14/07/18, 12:27:23 AM",Pranathi," She's just also really selfish. I don't like that. And if I told her also, she'd at most try to pretend she cares for my sake."
10628,"14/07/18, 12:27:28 AM",Pranathi, She doesn't really give a rat's ass what I do.
10629,"14/07/18, 12:27:51 AM",Pranathi," So I think that's over, and we'll probably be cordial but no more."
10630,"14/07/18, 12:27:59 AM",Pranathi, I think it was easier to be friends with her when I was dating Nick.
10631,"14/07/18, 12:28:16 AM",Sush, i guess she understood him>
10632,"14/07/18, 12:28:19 AM",Pranathi," They were both so similar. Obsessed with money, status. So being friends with her was almost validating of Nick's flaws."
10633,"14/07/18, 12:28:26 AM",Sush, hmm
10634,"14/07/18, 12:28:42 AM",Sush, that sounds tiresome to be very proximate to
10635,"14/07/18, 12:28:45 AM",Pranathi, And vice versa
10636,"14/07/18, 12:29:10 AM",Pranathi, Yeah. I think it's okay to let this friendship go. I don't think she's that desperate to hold on either.
10637,"14/07/18, 12:29:29 AM",Pranathi, She has enough new friends and I've only been reaching out the past few times anyway.
10638,"14/07/18, 12:29:35 AM",Pranathi, Ugh it just makes me feel sad though.
10639,"14/07/18, 12:29:46 AM",Sush, that is sad 
10640,"14/07/18, 12:29:50 AM",Pranathi," Anywayyyy, that's life I guess."
10641,"14/07/18, 12:30:00 AM",Sush, but also valid and legitimate if you want to distance yourself
10642,"14/07/18, 12:30:47 AM",Pranathi, Yeah. I don't like how I feel around her.
10643,"14/07/18, 12:30:53 AM",Pranathi, Or how I feel like I'm perceived by her.
10644,"14/07/18, 12:31:16 AM",Pranathi, As some sort of hippie freewheeling no good loser with not an ounce of pragmatism
10645,"14/07/18, 12:31:32 AM",Pranathi, Maybe it's in my head also
10646,"14/07/18, 12:31:35 AM",Sush," that's absurd, at best"

10850,"16/07/18, 12:25:16 AM",Pranathi," If she can just pack it and give me so that it's secure, that would be great"
10851,"16/07/18, 12:25:20 AM",Pranathi, I don't want it to break or something
10852,"16/07/18, 12:25:35 AM",Sush, Ya! My dad is in Chennai haha he loves that shit
10853,"16/07/18, 12:25:42 AM",Pranathi, And so exciting!! DSLR. I've been on the lookout for one but they're so expensive haha
10854,"16/07/18, 12:25:49 AM",Sush, They are!!
10855,"16/07/18, 12:26:00 AM",Pranathi, Loves packing things securely ah?
10856,"16/07/18, 12:26:02 AM",Sush, My sister doesn’t use this one anymore it was like her starter camera
10857,"16/07/18, 12:26:08 AM",Sush, Ya he loves packing stuff weirdo
10858,"16/07/18, 12:26:24 AM",Pranathi, Very nice! That'll be such a nice hobby to cultivate!
10859,"16/07/18, 12:26:39 AM",Sush, Ya! I already enjoy taking pictures on my phone
10860,"16/07/18, 12:26:46 AM",Sush, It’ll give me something to walk around for
10861,"16/07/18, 12:26:52 AM",Pranathi, And what are the two other things you wanted?
10862,"16/07/18, 12:26:59 AM",Pranathi, That lipstick and one more thing
10863,"16/07/18, 12:27:11 AM",Sush, Oh ya scarlet drill!
10864,"16/07/18, 12:27:33 AM",Sush, Other thing was Meenakshi ammal but pack that - I’ll get after I move to new place
10865,"16/07/18, 12:28:23 AM",Sush, Lipstick don’t go out of your way at all - not super important or anything
10866,"16/07/18, 12:28:35 AM",Pranathi, There's a Health and Glow by where I live so it should be easy only!
10867,"16/07/18, 12:28:43 AM",Sush, Ok yay!
10868,"16/07/18, 12:28:45 AM",Pranathi, And I'll see if I can get Meenakshi  Ammal also.
10869,"16/07/18, 12:28:57 AM",Sush, No Meenakshi ammal will be heavy also
10870,"16/07/18, 12:29:31 AM",Sush, and maybe I can flick my sister’s copy when I go 👻
10871,"16/07/18, 12:29:43 AM",Pranathi, Haha okay got it 
10872,"16/07/18, 12:29:58 AM",Sush, Have you had any new interviews?
10873,"16/07/18, 12:30:19 AM",Pranathi, A few more I'm trying to line up. One guy who does hiphop and gaana
10874,"16/07/18, 12:30:21 AM",Pranathi, Some MC Vijay
10875,"16/07/18, 12:30:26 AM",Pranathi, And also a bunch of Carnatic people
10876,"16/07/18, 12:30:52 AM",Pranathi," These gaana artists only I'm feeling intimidated to meet alone, and I also feel vacation inertia all of a sudden. Like I just want to sit at home and read books"
10877,"16/07/18, 12:31:04 AM",Sush, Nice! It’s so fascinating how non Brahmin Tamil boys find a resonance in hip hop and rap
10878,"16/07/18, 12:31:14 AM",Sush," Even the dancing, no?"
10879,"16/07/18, 12:31:23 AM",Pranathi, Yeah! I guess it makes a lot of sense
10880,"16/07/18, 12:31:28 AM",Sush, Fair enough!
10881,"16/07/18, 12:31:35 AM",Pranathi, There's an obvious undertone of resistance that they see as similar to their art
10882,"16/07/18, 12:31:44 AM",Sush, Like an expression of resistance ?
10883,"16/07/18, 12:31:47 AM",Sush, Ya!!
10884,"16/07/18, 12:31:47 AM",Pranathi, And this aspirational character of the music also
10885,"16/07/18, 12:31:53 AM",Sush, So true
10886,"16/07/18, 12:31:55 AM",Pranathi," Kaasu, panam, dhuddu, money money"
10887,"16/07/18, 12:32:05 AM",Pranathi, Lol
10888,"16/07/18, 12:32:12 AM",Pranathi," Bling, gold, Bugatti"
10889,"16/07/18, 12:32:16 AM",Pranathi, Same to same ditto sentiment
10890,"16/07/18, 12:32:17 AM",Sush, 💸💸💸
10891,"16/07/18, 12:32:56 AM",Pranathi, Btw!
10892,"16/07/18, 12:33:02 AM",Pranathi, I went to CreaShakti play with Yashasvini
10893,"16/07/18, 12:33:06 AM",Pranathi, Did I tell you?
10894,"16/07/18, 12:33:16 AM",Sush, Ohh! No you didn’t! Tell meee
10895,"16/07/18, 12:33:18 AM",Pranathi, This was day before
10896,"16/07/18, 12:33:20 AM",Sush, Was it Dolls?
10897,"16/07/18, 12:33:27 AM",Pranathi, So it's that Dushyanth's play. She asked me to come along
10898,"16/07/18, 12:33:28 AM",Pranathi," Yeah, Dolls!"
10899,"16/07/18, 12:33:35 AM",Pranathi," Namita was in it also, and some people I know from school times"
10900,"16/07/18, 12:33:38 AM",Sush, Oh nice! How was it?
10901,"16/07/18, 12:33:53 AM",Pranathi, That Dushyanth kept saying how I was a CS product and I didn't know how to tell him I've never acted in a single one of his plays lol
10902,"16/07/18, 12:33:55 AM",Sush, I talked to Dushyanth in December and he was v excited about it
10903,"16/07/18, 12:34:00 AM",Pranathi, But he let us watch it for free
10904,"16/07/18, 12:34:08 AM",Pranathi, Which I thought was very cute and nice!
10905,"16/07/18, 12:34:10 AM",Sush, 😂😂
10906,"16/07/18, 12:34:14 AM",Sush, So sweet
10907,"16/07/18, 12:34:18 AM",Pranathi, It was pretty decent! I liked some of the stories a lot
10908,"16/07/18, 12:34:23 AM",Pranathi, The rest I found slightly entitled
10909,"16/07/18, 12:34:29 AM",Pranathi," There was one girl, Subhiksha or something"
10910,"16/07/18, 12:34:31 AM",Sush, Each actor wrote it herself no?
10911,"16/07/18, 12:34:39 AM",Sush, Subhiksha Raman?
10912,"16/07/18, 12:34:50 AM",Sush, Lol I follow her on insta she seems to be the worssssttt
10913,"16/07/18, 12:34:55 AM",Sush, I hate-follow her
10914,"16/07/18, 12:35:20 AM",Pranathi, She told some dumb story about how her biggest bane in life is that she has rich daddy who's tryign to give her money. And she did some monoacting level piece about being in an airport and having the *worst* day because she lost her luggage and now she has to pay for extra luggage or some crap
10915,"16/07/18, 12:35:28 AM",Pranathi, And it ends with her asking her dad for money
10916,"16/07/18, 12:35:31 AM",Pranathi, It was so cringeworthy
10917,"16/07/18, 12:35:38 AM",Sush, Ewwww
10918,"16/07/18, 12:35:56 AM",Sush, YAK
10919,"16/07/18, 12:36:00 AM",Pranathi, She also name-dropped and talked about how she met Dhoni and Irfan Pathan because she dropped her dad's name
10920,"16/07/18, 12:36:06 AM",Pranathi, He's some cricket jersey exporter or something
10921,"16/07/18, 12:36:08 AM",Pranathi, I eye rolled so hard
10922,"16/07/18, 12:36:10 AM",Sush, Grosssssssss
10923,"16/07/18, 12:36:48 AM",Sush, Oh I’ve unfollowed her lol I wanted to show you
10924,"16/07/18, 12:36:51 AM",Sush, She’s terrible
10925,"16/07/18, 12:36:53 AM",Pranathi," One of my friends also performed. I know her from school, who I knew sort of peripherally really but she showed up at culturals allllll the time."
10926,"16/07/18, 12:36:58 AM",Sush, Her account is private now
10927,"16/07/18, 12:37:04 AM",Sush, How was she?
10928,"16/07/18, 12:37:09 AM",Sush, And how was Namita?
10929,"16/07/18, 12:37:12 AM",Pranathi, Edho terrible sentence construction but you get the drift
10930,"16/07/18, 12:37:25 AM",Pranathi, She did a piece on when she first discovered she got vitiligo
10931,"16/07/18, 12:37:38 AM",Sush, What is that?
10932,"16/07/18, 12:37:40 AM",Pranathi," It was quite good actually. It was less acting, and more of a TED talk type thing"
10933,"16/07/18, 12:37:48 AM",Pranathi, It's the thing that gives you patches of lighter skin
10934,"16/07/18, 12:37:55 AM",Sush, Ohh ok ok
10935,"16/07/18, 12:37:59 AM",Sush, Interesting!
10936,"16/07/18, 12:37:59 AM",Pranathi, Her mom also spoke
10937,"16/07/18, 12:38:18 AM",Pranathi, She's that Jayanthi Sabesh or whatever. I hated her piece. It was about how her maamiyar was so cool and helped everyone in that family become successful
10938,"16/07/18, 12:38:27 AM",Pranathi, Although I think Dushyanth helped write parts of that piece
10939,"16/07/18, 12:38:36 AM",Sush, 🤦🏽‍♀️
10940,"16/07/18, 12:38:58 AM",Pranathi, Namita's piece was good. It was about beauty standards. She has curly hair now. I didn't even realize how curly her hair was. She did a whole thing on straighteners and mascara. But it was all like spoken word
10941,"16/07/18, 12:39:04 AM",Pranathi, I was genuinely happy to see her though!
10942,"16/07/18, 12:39:15 AM",Pranathi, She was also very surprised to see me there and she was pretty sweet
10943,"16/07/18, 12:39:20 AM",Sush, Nice!
10944,"16/07/18, 12:39:43 AM",Sush, I didn’t know her but was wary because people called her baby snega lol
10945,"16/07/18, 12:39:45 AM",Pranathi, That girl's a very good writer.
10946,"16/07/18, 12:40:12 AM",Pranathi, Haha she was very strange in insti. But Yashasvini and I were talking about how everyone in insti sort of put on a public facade and we didn't really know anybody beyond a quick fix label
10947,"16/07/18, 12:40:26 AM",Sush, Correct
10948,"16/07/18, 12:40:35 AM",Sush, How is Yashasvini?
10949,"16/07/18, 12:40:57 AM",Pranathi, But paavam she's graduated and all. I felt so old! She's doing theater full time now and lives in Virugambakkam or something
10950,"16/07/18, 12:41:06 AM",Sush, That’s so cool!
10951,"16/07/18, 12:41:12 AM",Sush, Is she still dating Vaishwath
10952,"16/07/18, 12:41:19 AM",Pranathi, Yashasvini is fine! She got engaged no. She's also starting a new job next month
10953,"16/07/18, 12:41:33 AM",Pranathi, No idea. We didn't really hang out that much also! Namita was busy being with the rest of the cast and all
10954,"16/07/18, 12:41:38 AM",Sush, Oh yaaa nice! She finished her teaching stint no?
10955,"16/07/18, 12:41:56 AM",Pranathi," Yep, she finished and now she's chilling for a few weeks before starting work"
10956,"16/07/18, 12:42:01 AM",Pranathi, Paavam she has some back condition and all
10957,"16/07/18, 12:42:05 AM",Sush, Nice
10958,"16/07/18, 12:42:07 AM",Pranathi, So she's been getting intense physio
10959,"16/07/18, 12:42:08 AM",Sush, Ohh paapa!
10960,"16/07/18, 12:42:15 AM",Pranathi, That's why she's at home now
10961,"16/07/18, 12:42:29 AM",Pranathi, She has this crippling back pain and her muscles in the lower half of her body need repairing
10962,"16/07/18, 12:42:36 AM",Sush, Oh gosh 
10963,"16/07/18, 12:42:44 AM",Pranathi, She was telling me about this prof Joe Karackattu! You remember him?
10964,"16/07/18, 12:42:50 AM",Sush, Ya!
10965,"16/07/18, 12:42:59 AM",Sush, He was very very nice to Gayathri
10966,"16/07/18, 12:43:08 AM",Sush, What did she say I’m so curious
10967,"16/07/18, 12:43:16 AM",Sush, Wait I’ll call?
10968,"16/07/18, 12:43:28 AM",Pranathi, Paavam this happened to him
10969,"16/07/18, 12:43:30 AM",Pranathi, Yeah call!
10970,"16/07/18, 12:43:43 AM",Pranathi, I'll have to go in ten minutes and shower my mom will yell but call off after reading article

11007,"16/07/18, 9:44:58 PM",Pranathi, And coming back sounds nearly impossible
11008,"16/07/18, 9:45:12 PM",Sush, totally understand

11034,"16/07/18, 9:48:29 PM",Sush, he clearly has no ideas that can stand on their own
11035,"16/07/18, 9:49:00 PM",Pranathi, Yeah. He can't even thread together a simple plot
11036,"16/07/18, 9:49:16 PM",Pranathi, It's like when an artist drops a can of paint on his canvas and calls it post-modern.
11037,"16/07/18, 9:49:16 PM",Sush, first 20% of the book - no plot yet
11038,"16/07/18, 9:49:24 PM",Sush, except some random girlfriend in sf

11044,"16/07/18, 9:49:50 PM",Pranathi, I wonder if only men can read that without the sense that it's terrible
11045,"16/07/18, 9:49:56 PM",Pranathi, What did he say?
11046,"16/07/18, 9:50:17 PM",Sush, like she was some turning point in his life - only then did it dawn on him that women have complex inner lives or smth like that
11047,"16/07/18, 9:50:34 PM",Sush," i'm being a bit reductionist while paraphrasing, but sort of to that effect"
11048,"16/07/18, 9:50:42 PM",Pranathi, Ughhh
11049,"16/07/18, 9:50:57 PM",Sush, i had never seen ferrante as 'women's writing'
11050,"16/07/18, 9:50:57 PM",Pranathi, Uday will read some very high faluting philosophers just for fun with no sense of irony
11051,"16/07/18, 9:51:02 PM",Sush, lolol
11052,"16/07/18, 9:51:02 PM",Pranathi, That's the kind of person he is.
11053,"16/07/18, 9:51:09 PM",Pranathi, We don't even know if Ferrante is really a woman
11054,"16/07/18, 9:51:21 PM",Pranathi, Wouldn't it be the coolest thing if it was a man using a woman's name as a pseudonym
11055,"16/07/18, 9:51:25 PM",Sush, i feel like she HAS to be
11056,"16/07/18, 9:51:38 PM",Sush, men don't write women that well
11057,"16/07/18, 9:51:49 PM",Sush," it's too intimate, she knows too much"
11058,"16/07/18, 9:52:07 PM",Pranathi, That's true
11059,"16/07/18, 9:52:33 PM",Sush, i can't imagine a man writing that book without at least 300% more references to lila's boobs 
11060,"16/07/18, 9:52:39 PM",Pranathi, Hahaha
11061,"16/07/18, 9:52:55 PM",Pranathi, Honestly that's how I found out Sidney Sheldon was a man
11062,"16/07/18, 9:53:01 PM",Sush, hahahaha!
11063,"16/07/18, 9:53:04 PM",Pranathi, It was just so sexualizing
11064,"16/07/18, 9:53:26 PM",Pranathi, Uday is one trippy fellow
11065,"16/07/18, 9:53:37 PM",Pranathi," Btw, word of warning. If he invites you to his house, find a way not to go unless you want to be attacked by his cat"
11066,"16/07/18, 9:53:38 PM",Sush, he's sooo earnest it seems
11067,"16/07/18, 9:53:43 PM",Sush, omg ok
11068,"16/07/18, 9:53:52 PM",Pranathi, That thing pounces from across the room and it literally attached itself to my shin with its jaws
11069,"16/07/18, 9:53:55 PM",Sush, i'll say i have allergy
11070,"16/07/18, 9:53:56 PM",Pranathi, and it HURT

11074,"16/07/18, 9:55:14 PM",Pranathi, I know. Pet people are so annoying
11075,"16/07/18, 9:55:24 PM",Pranathi, I don't know if I could be with someone who wants to have pets
11076,"16/07/18, 9:55:30 PM",Sush, i cant marry a pet owner
11077,"16/07/18, 9:55:32 PM",Pranathi," Maybe a cute, well-behaved dog"
11078,"16/07/18, 9:55:33 PM",Pranathi, Definitely not a cat
11079,"16/07/18, 9:55:44 PM",Sush, i'd prefer a little cat
11080,"16/07/18, 9:55:43 PM",Pranathi, But dogs require so much attention and care
11081,"16/07/18, 9:55:52 PM",Sush, or a FOX
11082,"16/07/18, 9:55:53 PM",Pranathi, I don't know. It all seems too much tbh
11083,"16/07/18, 9:55:55 PM",Pranathi, I'd prefer a little human
11084,"16/07/18, 9:55:58 PM",Sush, have you seen fox_kuzma?!
11085,"16/07/18, 9:55:59 PM",Pranathi, A fox hahaha

11097,"16/07/18, 9:57:34 PM",Pranathi, The thing with animals is that they use their teeth so much
11098,"16/07/18, 9:57:39 PM",Pranathi, And I am scared of things that can puncture skin
11099,"16/07/18, 9:57:46 PM",Sush, correct!!

11104,"16/07/18, 9:58:04 PM",Pranathi, They raised us to be afraid of animals

11108,"16/07/18, 9:58:31 PM",Pranathi, That's why I enjoyed lifting weights so much
11109,"16/07/18, 9:58:37 PM",Pranathi, It made me feel like I was going against my socialization

11129,"16/07/18, 10:02:36 PM",Pranathi, I feel like she will think I am some special kind of slovenly slob
11130,"16/07/18, 10:02:50 PM",Sush, no my mom and i have both told her you are ACES and she wants to meet you also!
11131,"16/07/18, 10:02:53 PM",Pranathi, She seems so put together from her Instagram

11150,"16/07/18, 10:06:54 PM",Sush, It’s so extra and slightly too unfiltered
11151,"16/07/18, 10:07:23 PM",Pranathi, Wait I have to see it. 
11152,"16/07/18, 10:08:09 PM",Sush, 😬
11153,"16/07/18, 10:08:27 PM",Pranathi, I think it's very cute!
11154,"16/07/18, 10:08:36 PM",Pranathi, And extra and all is in the eye of the beholder
11155,"16/07/18, 10:08:39 PM",Pranathi, Don't see yourself as extra
11156,"16/07/18, 10:08:41 PM",Pranathi, ❤

11158,"16/07/18, 10:08:46 PM",Sush, ❤ 😘
11159,"16/07/18, 10:09:00 PM",Sush, i figure i should show my fans my unfiltered self now and then
11160,"16/07/18, 10:09:09 PM",Sush, so they won't be too intimated by my usual perfection
11161,"16/07/18, 10:09:15 PM",Sush, 👻👻👻👻👻
11162,"16/07/18, 10:09:22 PM",Pranathi, That's true. Must remind them that you woke up like dis.

11172,"16/07/18, 10:10:05 PM",Sush, ohhh
11173,"16/07/18, 10:10:10 PM",Pranathi, I thought he was for like ten seconds and then I realized he's just a quizzer.
11174,"16/07/18, 10:10:13 PM",Pranathi, Who can mug up facts
11175,"16/07/18, 10:10:19 PM",Sush, ohhhh

11179,"16/07/18, 10:12:18 PM",Pranathi, Oh Suraj lolol
11180,"16/07/18, 10:12:24 PM",Pranathi, I hate that he has his own emoji
11181,"16/07/18, 10:12:52 PM",Pranathi, Sometimes I forget I dated Suraj
11182,"16/07/18, 10:13:02 PM",Pranathi, It's like one of those awful memories I just want to repress
11183,"16/07/18, 10:13:12 PM",Sush, totes fairrrr
11184,"16/07/18, 10:15:11 PM",Pranathi, I just made an appointment with the dermatologist
11185,"16/07/18, 10:15:19 PM",Pranathi, I want to figure out this sudden dandruff situation
11186,"16/07/18, 10:15:25 PM",Sush, ohh very good
11187,"16/07/18, 10:15:28 PM",Pranathi, He gave me one shampoo last time that worked really well
11188,"16/07/18, 10:15:34 PM",Pranathi, And also I have an embarrassing condition
11189,"16/07/18, 10:15:35 PM",Sush, nice!
11190,"16/07/18, 10:15:41 PM",Sush, kya?
11191,"16/07/18, 10:15:49 PM",Sush, means you don't have to see if you odn't want to
11192,"16/07/18, 10:15:57 PM",Pranathi, You will laugh/judge if I tell and I am feeling embarrassed but I also want to tell
11193,"16/07/18, 10:16:04 PM",Pranathi, Because I have to tell someone and I am having hypochondria
11194,"16/07/18, 10:16:11 PM",Sush, tell to
11195,"16/07/18, 10:16:14 PM",Sush, i won't laugh
11196,"16/07/18, 10:16:16 PM",Pranathi, You won't laugh?
11197,"16/07/18, 10:16:19 PM",Pranathi, Promise?
11198,"16/07/18, 10:16:27 PM",Sush, ok i might laugh a little but i DEFINITELY won't judge
11199,"16/07/18, 10:16:39 PM",Pranathi, Haha okay
11200,"16/07/18, 10:16:46 PM",Pranathi, So basically I have a skin tag down there
11201,"16/07/18, 10:17:08 PM",Pranathi, On my butt hole. I got it checked out in America because I was worried
11202,"16/07/18, 10:17:14 PM",Sush, ohh i remember this
11203,"16/07/18, 10:17:17 PM",Pranathi, And that lady says it happens if you have big booty or exert too much pressure
11204,"16/07/18, 10:17:24 PM",Pranathi, Which is so embarrassing
11205,"16/07/18, 10:17:37 PM",Pranathi, But she said usually it has to be frozen off and that's too expensive in America
11206,"16/07/18, 10:17:50 PM",Sush, pfft it isn't embarrassing
11207,"16/07/18, 10:17:51 PM",Pranathi, I figure they can probably do it here because India
11208,"16/07/18, 10:17:57 PM",Pranathi, ARE YOU SURE
11209,"16/07/18, 10:17:57 PM",Sush, oh ya true
11210,"16/07/18, 10:18:00 PM",Sush, 100%
11211,"16/07/18, 10:18:05 PM",Pranathi, I live in mortal embarrassment of this everyday
11212,"16/07/18, 10:18:13 PM",Sush, noooo
11213,"16/07/18, 10:18:22 PM",Sush, people have ALL KINDS OF THINGS on their bodies
11214,"16/07/18, 10:18:28 PM",Sush, i have mad stretch marks
11215,"16/07/18, 10:18:42 PM",Sush, does the skin tag irritate you physically
11216,"16/07/18, 10:18:58 PM",Pranathi, Not really!
11217,"16/07/18, 10:19:08 PM",Pranathi, But sometimes I get really self conscious about it
11218,"16/07/18, 10:19:13 PM",Pranathi, And especially when having sex.
11219,"16/07/18, 10:19:17 PM",Pranathi, Not that I am having sex
11220,"16/07/18, 10:19:25 PM",Pranathi, But I don't want it to become some sort of complex
11221,"16/07/18, 10:19:30 PM",Sush, fair
11222,"16/07/18, 10:19:35 PM",Sush, no harm finding out i guess!
11223,"16/07/18, 10:19:51 PM",Pranathi, And also it just feels like a gross thing
11224,"16/07/18, 10:19:57 PM",Pranathi, Because ofc I went online and googled it
11225,"16/07/18, 10:20:09 PM",Pranathi, And people have these discussion boards where they say they're embarrassed about it
11226,"16/07/18, 10:20:18 PM",Pranathi," Or worse, their partners post saying that they feel turned off by it"
11227,"16/07/18, 10:20:28 PM",Pranathi, UGH but also those people must be idiots
11228,"16/07/18, 10:20:32 PM",Sush, ya!
11229,"16/07/18, 10:20:53 PM",Pranathi, Raffaella and I were talking about this.
11230,"16/07/18, 10:20:54 PM",Sush, i was convinced that mikhail broke up with me because i have stretch marks for a week or so
11231,"16/07/18, 10:21:09 PM",Pranathi, She had some procedure and it would leave a scar down there. She didn't want to get it done for the longest time because of how it would look.
11232,"16/07/18, 10:21:26 PM",Pranathi," But then she was like, if this is the reason someone doesn't want to have sex with me, then I shouldn't be having sex with them in the first place."
11233,"16/07/18, 10:21:40 PM",Sush, true
11234,"16/07/18, 10:21:52 PM",Pranathi, God. I also have crazy stretch marks. But I think we all need to tell each other it's okay
11235,"16/07/18, 10:21:59 PM",Pranathi, Normalize the imperfect body
11236,"16/07/18, 10:22:03 PM",Pranathi," Whatever ""imperfect"" means"
11237,"16/07/18, 10:22:06 PM",Sush, true
11238,"16/07/18, 10:22:08 PM",Pranathi, Who decides what perfection is anyway.
11239,"16/07/18, 10:22:11 PM",Sush, non airbrushed butts
11240,"16/07/18, 10:22:16 PM",Sush, i hate my butt lol
11241,"16/07/18, 10:22:22 PM",Pranathi, Ooh I'd follow that Instagram handle.
11242,"16/07/18, 10:22:26 PM",Sush, i think it's strong that's all
11243,"16/07/18, 10:22:34 PM",Pranathi, I really hate my butt too.
11244,"16/07/18, 10:22:43 PM",Pranathi," I have scars, stretch marks, now this."
11245,"16/07/18, 10:22:46 PM",Sush, but i did squats the other day and could barely walk for 2 days lol
11246,"16/07/18, 10:23:02 PM",Sush, i wonder if men feel this way at all
11247,"16/07/18, 10:23:27 PM",Pranathi, Men definitely feel this way. But probably can't articulate it to themselves also
11248,"16/07/18, 10:23:33 PM",Pranathi, I know Nick was crazy insecure about his body
11249,"16/07/18, 10:23:49 PM",Pranathi, I think American men especially have crazy body issues
11250,"16/07/18, 10:23:56 PM",Sush, probably
11251,"16/07/18, 10:24:09 PM",Sush, indian men seem happy with their paunches / skinny arms
11252,"16/07/18, 10:24:21 PM",Pranathi, Yeah. My brother is looking like one uncle and unabashedly eats
11253,"16/07/18, 10:24:24 PM",Pranathi, I'm almost glad
11254,"16/07/18, 10:24:34 PM",Sush, ya good only!
11255,"16/07/18, 10:24:36 PM",Pranathi, I'd prefer that to him feeling guilty about eating
11256,"16/07/18, 10:24:38 PM",Sush, unnecessary hangups
11257,"16/07/18, 10:24:40 PM",Pranathi, But I also envy him.
11258,"16/07/18, 10:24:53 PM",Pranathi, I wish I could eat that uninhibitedly
11259,"16/07/18, 10:24:57 PM",Sush, ya food is sooo tied with guilt
11260,"16/07/18, 10:25:03 PM",Sush, i enjoyed my little parathas today
11261,"16/07/18, 10:25:11 PM",Sush, they were fun to roll out!
11262,"16/07/18, 10:25:38 PM",Pranathi, Oh yeahhh!
11263,"16/07/18, 10:25:46 PM",Pranathi, So fancy! How you made?
11264,"16/07/18, 10:25:46 PM",Pranathi, Tell me process 
11265,"16/07/18, 10:25:57 PM",Sush, hahaha
11266,"16/07/18, 10:26:11 PM",Sush," i kneaded off wheat with a little salt, oil and water"
11267,"16/07/18, 10:26:18 PM",Sush, left it to rest for 30 mins
11268,"16/07/18, 10:26:54 PM",Sush," then i boiled a baby potato, grated paneer, tiny chopped onions and a little coriander with green chilli, turmeric, salt, ajwain"
11269,"16/07/18, 10:27:02 PM",Sush, mashed it together
11270,"16/07/18, 10:27:43 PM",Pranathi, Yummmm
11271,"16/07/18, 10:27:43 PM",Sush," then i tried 2 methods haha - one is roll out two discs and place filling in between, close and roll out and the other is roll out one disc, place filling, close it up and roll out again"
11272,"16/07/18, 10:27:46 PM",Pranathi, That sounds so good
11273,"16/07/18, 10:28:09 PM",Pranathi, Which worked better?
11274,"16/07/18, 10:28:21 PM",Sush, the second has higher filling to wheat ratio
11275,"16/07/18, 10:28:27 PM",Sush, but the first _looks_ better 
11276,"16/07/18, 10:28:36 PM",Sush, and rolls beautifully
11277,"16/07/18, 10:28:52 PM",Pranathi, Ahhh that makes sense!
11278,"16/07/18, 10:29:05 PM",Pranathi, I am always in favor of high filling to dough ratio though
11279,"16/07/18, 10:29:11 PM",Sush, how did your  birthday dinner turn out?
11280,"16/07/18, 10:29:13 PM",Pranathi, Especially after mess parathas that were mostly maavu
11281,"16/07/18, 10:29:15 PM",Sush, means your dad's
11282,"16/07/18, 10:29:19 PM",Sush, omg yes
11283,"16/07/18, 10:29:26 PM",Sush, and uncooked slimy onions
11284,"16/07/18, 10:29:31 PM",Pranathi," My grandmom no, she boils potatoes and then grates them so that it rolls out in the paratha more evenly"
11285,"16/07/18, 10:29:41 PM",Pranathi," Ew yeah, I hated those onions."
11286,"16/07/18, 10:29:47 PM",Sush, ohhh
11287,"16/07/18, 10:29:53 PM",Sush, i should try that!
11288,"16/07/18, 10:29:57 PM",Sush, no lumps
11289,"16/07/18, 10:30:07 PM",Pranathi," The dinner was so good! I made quesadillas, fajitas and guac"
11290,"16/07/18, 10:30:10 PM",Pranathi, My dad helped cook which was fun
11291,"16/07/18, 10:30:16 PM",Pranathi, He was such a good little helper
11292,"16/07/18, 10:30:18 PM",Sush, Yammy!
11293,"16/07/18, 10:30:21 PM",Sush, Hahaha so cute
11294,"16/07/18, 10:30:22 PM",Pranathi, And my mom left the kitchen which was nice
11295,"16/07/18, 10:30:29 PM",Pranathi, Dude avocados here are HUGE
11296,"16/07/18, 10:30:34 PM",Pranathi, They're like three times the size of the TI ones
11297,"16/07/18, 10:30:45 PM",Pranathi, They look very different
11298,"16/07/18, 10:31:46 PM",Sush, Whoaaa
11299,"16/07/18, 10:31:48 PM",Pranathi," Did I tell you about the etymology of the word ""avocado""?"
11300,"16/07/18, 10:31:54 PM",Sush, Where you found?
11301,"16/07/18, 10:31:57 PM",Sush," No, say!"
11302,"16/07/18, 10:32:06 PM",Pranathi, Pazhamudir Nilayam! They're everywhere actually
11303,"16/07/18, 10:32:21 PM",Pranathi, Avocado comes from a Mayan word for testicles. Avocados grow in pairs and they're low-hanging fruit
11304,"16/07/18, 10:32:22 PM",Pranathi, No joke
11305,"16/07/18, 10:32:26 PM",Sush, Ohhhh

11311,"16/07/18, 10:33:29 PM",Sush, today was a fail day except for paratha
11312,"16/07/18, 10:34:39 PM",Pranathi, No fail days
11313,"16/07/18, 10:34:51 PM",Pranathi, All days are what they are only. And you are amazing
11314,"16/07/18, 10:36:06 PM",Sush, That is toh correct 😘😂
11315,"16/07/18, 10:36:16 PM",Sush, I was so bored all day

11328,"16/07/18, 11:04:22 PM",Pranathi, I feel so much better sighhh
11329,"16/07/18, 11:04:36 PM",Pranathi, Sometimes I get stressed when I put off work. Then I get into a rut and I can't do it also and I feel horrible about myself
11330,"16/07/18, 11:36:16 PM",Sush, Good good! Ya that pattern is the worst
11331,"16/07/18, 11:45:23 PM",Pranathi, I love this Costas

11335,"16/07/18, 11:54:23 PM",Sush, it must be so grounding no? to get this feedback during fieldwork?
11336,"17/07/18, 12:07:49 AM",Pranathi, Yesss it makes me feel less like I'm OB adichufying here
11337,"17/07/18, 6:32:26 AM",Pranathi, I am booooooored
11338,"17/07/18, 6:32:36 AM",Pranathi, Are you awake? ❤

11348,"17/07/18, 6:52:12 AM",Pranathi, I love when news/research can make you feel better about things you're not supposed to be too proud of haha
11349,"17/07/18, 6:53:09 AM",Sush, I knkw😂
11350,"17/07/18, 6:53:28 AM",Sush, My tenth boards English exam essay was about how gossip was therapeutic
11351,"17/07/18, 6:53:29 AM",Sush, Lol
11352,"17/07/18, 6:53:37 AM",Sush, No wonder I didn’t do well
11353,"17/07/18, 6:53:43 AM",Pranathi, Hahaha
11354,"17/07/18, 6:53:59 AM",Pranathi, So trippy
11355,"17/07/18, 6:54:11 AM",Pranathi, Only you would try to shock the exam correcting people 
11356,"17/07/18, 6:54:28 AM",Sush, Why for me 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️
11357,"17/07/18, 6:54:53 AM",Sush, Some Aunty in Lucknow must’ve been like wtf 3/10
11358,"17/07/18, 6:55:14 AM",Sush, Ok that was ageist and classist
11359,"17/07/18, 6:55:40 AM",Pranathi, HAhaha
11360,"17/07/18, 6:55:41 AM",Pranathi, Issok
11361,"17/07/18, 6:55:51 AM",Pranathi, I feel like all my PCness is being tested so hard being here
11362,"17/07/18, 6:55:58 AM",Sush, hahaha
11363,"17/07/18, 6:56:09 AM",Pranathi, I was taken by my dad along with mom and brother to visit his friend's family
11364,"17/07/18, 6:56:21 AM",Pranathi, Which I think is so patriarchal. It's not like my whole family will be prevailed upon to visit my mom's friend
11365,"17/07/18, 6:56:32 AM",Pranathi, And I hated the idea of it completely because I hate his friend and his family
11366,"17/07/18, 6:56:49 AM",Pranathi, That uncle made some really awful comment about how they were looking for houses and they wouldn't live in one house because it was a Muslim house
11367,"17/07/18, 6:57:00 AM",Sush, Oh gosh 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️
11368,"17/07/18, 6:57:04 AM",Pranathi," And I mentioned that to my dad later, and he got upset with ME."
11369,"17/07/18, 6:57:16 AM",Pranathi," He was like, ""If you're so judgmental then you won't have any friends. Everyone will have some faults."""
11370,"17/07/18, 6:57:31 AM",Pranathi," And I told him I decide which faults to let slip, and bigotry isn't one."
11371,"17/07/18, 6:57:34 AM",Pranathi, He got reeeeeally mad.
11372,"17/07/18, 6:57:46 AM",Sush, Ayyo!
11373,"17/07/18, 6:58:03 AM",Sush, So true though that it’s a personal choice as to which faults you let slip
11374,"17/07/18, 6:58:08 AM",Sush, So nicely you have said
11375,"17/07/18, 6:58:24 AM",Pranathi, Aww thanks for affirming me ya
11376,"17/07/18, 6:58:30 AM",Pranathi, I feel like I am going crazy in this house
11377,"17/07/18, 6:58:36 AM",Pranathi, Like nothing I do is acceptable apparently
11378,"17/07/18, 6:58:41 AM",Pranathi, I am just holed up in my room pretending to work
11379,"17/07/18, 6:58:55 AM",Sush, Ayyo 
11380,"17/07/18, 6:59:01 AM",Pranathi, I sound like an angsty teenager and I'm whining to you kaalam kathaala!
11381,"17/07/18, 6:59:05 AM",Pranathi, Sorry!
11382,"17/07/18, 6:59:12 AM",Sush, Hahaha no no I can totally sympathise
11383,"17/07/18, 6:59:26 AM",Sush, I’ve def felt this way at home
11384,"17/07/18, 7:00:00 AM",Sush, Did I tell you my mom and sister literally didn’t talk to me for like 3 hrs after I said I’d probably vote congress next election lol
11385,"17/07/18, 7:00:10 AM",Pranathi, Seriously/
11386,"17/07/18, 7:00:11 AM",Pranathi, ?
11387,"17/07/18, 7:00:22 AM",Pranathi, Hahaha sounds like something my family would definitely do
11388,"17/07/18, 7:00:27 AM",Sush, Well they were flabbergasted lol
11389,"17/07/18, 7:00:30 AM",Pranathi," I mean, first my dad would yell though"
11390,"17/07/18, 7:00:36 AM",Sush, and dad was so happy lolol
11391,"17/07/18, 7:00:40 AM",Pranathi, Hahaha
11392,"17/07/18, 7:01:08 AM",Sush, But ya man my bp shoots up when dad starts discussing Modi
11393,"17/07/18, 7:01:17 AM",Sush, And you end up getting drawn into engaging
11394,"17/07/18, 7:01:23 AM",Sush, However much you want to ignore
11395,"17/07/18, 7:01:30 AM",Sush, Because it’s such flagrant BS
11396,"17/07/18, 7:01:39 AM",Pranathi, Yeahhhh. I wish I had the zen like abilities required to deal with dad-ly creatures
11397,"17/07/18, 7:01:52 AM",Sush, Srsly
11398,"17/07/18, 7:02:00 AM",Sush, Also so unfair that the onus is on us to ignore
11399,"17/07/18, 7:02:12 AM",Sush, Legitimises their behaviour also
11400,"17/07/18, 7:02:17 AM",Pranathi," Yeah. My mom also knows he's being ridiculous, but asks me to just let it slide"
11401,"17/07/18, 7:02:22 AM",Pranathi," Because ""anyway I'm leaving soon"""
11402,"17/07/18, 7:02:30 AM",Pranathi, Which I think is just dumb for the long run
11403,"17/07/18, 7:02:35 AM",Sush, Ya it is
11404,"17/07/18, 7:02:36 AM",Pranathi, He's going to get more and more set in his ways.
11405,"17/07/18, 7:02:49 AM",Sush, Leaving or not he’s your dad you’re his daughter
11406,"17/07/18, 7:02:56 AM",Pranathi," Literally every time I challenge him, I'm the only one who's challenged him in like forever"
11407,"17/07/18, 7:03:11 AM",Pranathi, My brother is soooo passive man
11408,"17/07/18, 7:03:17 AM",Pranathi, And he idol worships my dad it feels like
11409,"17/07/18, 7:03:30 AM",Pranathi," Which annoys me and makes me feel excluded at some level, but also I don't want to be included"
11410,"17/07/18, 7:03:37 AM",Pranathi, Because they're so.... male.
11411,"17/07/18, 7:04:10 AM",Sush, Ya 
11412,"17/07/18, 7:04:14 AM",Sush, It suits them so nicely
11413,"17/07/18, 7:04:29 AM",Pranathi, Yeah. My dad rewards him in subtle ways for not challenging him
11414,"17/07/18, 7:04:42 AM",Pranathi," If I walk into the room, they'll continue the conversation like I didn't just enter"
11415,"17/07/18, 7:04:50 AM",Pranathi, Like zero effort to even explain what they're talking about
11416,"17/07/18, 7:04:59 AM",Pranathi, That annoying way that men have of just having conversations among themselves.
11417,"17/07/18, 7:05:03 AM",Pranathi, It's driving me INSANE
11418,"17/07/18, 7:05:04 AM",Sush, omg ya
11419,"17/07/18, 7:05:16 AM",Sush, Purusha pesara
11420,"17/07/18, 7:05:21 AM",Pranathi, Ewwww
11421,"17/07/18, 7:05:32 AM",Pranathi, And my mom is also so passive
11422,"17/07/18, 7:05:38 AM",Pranathi, I try to get her on my side and at least vent sometimes
11423,"17/07/18, 7:05:50 AM",Pranathi, She'll get worried that I am dissing family members and tell me to shush basically
11424,"17/07/18, 7:05:56 AM",Pranathi, It's so frustrating.
11425,"17/07/18, 7:06:00 AM",Pranathi," Okay done with rant, sorry!"
11426,"17/07/18, 7:06:02 AM",Sush, That’s so annoying 
11427,"17/07/18, 7:06:02 AM",Pranathi, I am going on an don
11428,"17/07/18, 7:06:04 AM",Pranathi, *and on
11429,"17/07/18, 7:06:18 AM",Sush, Chee no you have to get it out of your system also
11430,"17/07/18, 7:06:44 AM",Sush, At least to the degree that talking about it can
11431,"17/07/18, 7:06:47 AM",Pranathi, Yeah. I am actually just deeply disappointed in my lack of allyship with my brother
11432,"17/07/18, 7:06:55 AM",Pranathi, He just doesn't seem to give a shit how I'm feeling
11433,"17/07/18, 7:07:10 AM",Pranathi, And I'm almost resentful that I stuck my neck out for him and had that whole yelling match with dad about his depression
11434,"17/07/18, 7:07:23 AM",Sush, That does suck 
11435,"17/07/18, 7:07:23 AM",Pranathi," We haven't even talked about his depression once, and he doesn't even try to come talk to me"
11436,"17/07/18, 7:07:40 AM",Sush, Oh man that is also so frustratingly male
11437,"17/07/18, 7:07:43 AM",Pranathi," I tried a few times, we bonded a little over music. But he doesn't ask about my life"
11438,"17/07/18, 7:07:53 AM",Pranathi, He'll just walk behind my dad like a little pet
11439,"17/07/18, 7:08:00 AM",Pranathi, Ughhhh
11440,"17/07/18, 7:08:02 AM",Pranathi, It is so male
11441,"17/07/18, 7:08:22 AM",Pranathi," Anyway, he's going off for a few days to Pilani"
11442,"17/07/18, 7:08:34 AM",Pranathi, He's meeting friends and it was supposed to be his convocation
11443,"17/07/18, 7:08:41 AM",Pranathi, It'll give us some space I guess
11444,"17/07/18, 7:08:41 AM",Sush, Ohhh
11445,"17/07/18, 7:08:45 AM",Sush, Yeah true
11446,"17/07/18, 7:09:09 AM",Sush, So unfortunate though that he isn’t seeing you
11447,"17/07/18, 7:09:14 AM",Pranathi," I think I'm in that really shitty part of being home that's sort of right in the middle. So all the feels of me arriving after forever are gone, and they haven't thought about me leaving yet"
11448,"17/07/18, 7:09:27 AM",Sush, Haha I knoowwww
11449,"17/07/18, 7:09:40 AM",Pranathi, Yeah. I think he gets annoyed at me when I tell him to stop yelling. He's just so loud.
11450,"17/07/18, 7:09:44 AM",Pranathi, Imagine if Jonathan was your brother
11451,"17/07/18, 7:09:48 AM",Sush, 😂
11452,"17/07/18, 7:09:53 AM",Pranathi, And he was behaving in all these male ways
11453,"17/07/18, 7:10:03 AM",Sush, TAKE UP LESS SPACE
11454,"17/07/18, 7:10:12 AM",Pranathi, He takes up SO MUCH SPACE
11455,"17/07/18, 7:10:28 AM",Pranathi," Even the TV, he just assumes it's his to watch unless I ask"
11456,"17/07/18, 7:10:34 AM",Pranathi, And then he'll sigh really loudly and pass me the remote
11457,"17/07/18, 7:10:39 AM",Pranathi, EW
11458,"17/07/18, 7:10:47 AM",Sush, 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️
11459,"17/07/18, 7:10:55 AM",Sush, So freaking male
11460,"17/07/18, 7:11:06 AM",Pranathi, YUCK. Who will even tell him it's fucked up if not me?
11461,"17/07/18, 7:11:16 AM",Pranathi, My mom doesn't like me saying aaaanything to him. Not like she says
11462,"17/07/18, 7:11:16 AM",Sush, Ya my dad will also just come change no matter who is watching
11463,"17/07/18, 7:11:19 AM",Pranathi, And my dad doesn't even notice
11464,"17/07/18, 7:11:25 AM",Sush, We just have to lump it
11465,"17/07/18, 7:11:39 AM",Pranathi, Ugh. That's so frustrating no.
11466,"17/07/18, 7:11:45 AM",Sush, Extremely
11467,"17/07/18, 7:11:47 AM",Pranathi," It's just like, ""My resources, all mine."""
11468,"17/07/18, 7:11:55 AM",Sush, By default
11469,"17/07/18, 7:12:07 AM",Sush, And like you said with the sighing
11470,"17/07/18, 7:12:22 AM",Sush, You took my resources so you’re forcing me to snatch back
11471,"17/07/18, 7:12:32 AM",Sush, And then when I do you’re like ugh so rude with the snatching
11472,"17/07/18, 7:13:05 AM",Pranathi, Yeahhhh. Even with the yelling. How can he get annoyed? He does it when I'm trying to sleep
11473,"17/07/18, 7:13:14 AM",Pranathi, And gets annoyed that I can't sleep through his yelling
11474,"17/07/18, 7:13:23 AM",Sush, Lol that’s nuts
11475,"17/07/18, 7:13:23 AM",Pranathi, He plays metal music loudly at like 7 in the morning
11476,"17/07/18, 7:13:29 AM",Sush, Nooooo
11477,"17/07/18, 7:13:39 AM",Pranathi, He's literally a trope of himself
11478,"17/07/18, 7:15:51 AM",Pranathi," Dude my mom just gave me a ""beauty tip"""
11479,"17/07/18, 7:15:56 AM",Pranathi," For my ""receding hairline"""
11480,"17/07/18, 7:16:07 AM",Pranathi," She was like, ""You were worried about tha tno?"
11481,"17/07/18, 7:16:10 AM",Sush, No no no no
11482,"17/07/18, 7:16:15 AM",Pranathi," And I said no... She goes, ""You only said."""
11483,"17/07/18, 7:16:22 AM",Pranathi, I definitely hadn't thought about it
11484,"17/07/18, 7:16:28 AM",Pranathi, Is my hairline receding?
11485,"17/07/18, 7:16:32 AM",Sush, You have a luscious head of hair!
11486,"17/07/18, 7:16:56 AM",Pranathi, Ugh my mom is also such a traitor man
11487,"17/07/18, 7:17:15 AM",Sush, Honestly if there’s one problem you needn’t worry about it’s probably that
11488,"17/07/18, 7:17:27 AM",Pranathi, I actually feel like shit about how I look at home
11489,"17/07/18, 7:17:33 AM",Pranathi, Which is the opposite of how it should be
11490,"17/07/18, 7:17:37 AM",Pranathi, I don't even make an effort at home
11491,"17/07/18, 7:17:51 AM",Pranathi, I wear such shitty clothes and all
11492,"17/07/18, 7:18:02 AM",Sush, And that needs to be ok
11493,"17/07/18, 7:18:06 AM",Pranathi, I feel also horrible about bitching about my family this much
11494,"17/07/18, 7:18:23 AM",Pranathi, But I just feel so claustrophobic here sometimes
11495,"17/07/18, 7:18:34 AM",Sush, No I get you’re at this point where you’re like I want to be cherishing you idiots but you’re SO ANNOYING
11496,"17/07/18, 7:18:46 AM",Pranathi," It's that weird claim that parents seem to have to challenging self-esteem, just because they raised you and shit."
11497,"17/07/18, 7:19:06 AM",Pranathi, Yeah EXACTLY. Like I'm looking to have a good time but it's literally a comedy of errors constantly
11498,"17/07/18, 7:19:23 AM",Sush, Ugh ya I’m like you only made me
11499,"17/07/18, 7:19:25 AM",Sush, Now you keep
11500,"17/07/18, 7:19:32 AM",Sush, Take what you made
11501,"17/07/18, 7:20:10 AM",Pranathi, Haha yeah. I just want them to not be on the project of improving me constantly
11502,"17/07/18, 7:20:40 AM",Pranathi, They don't seem to see that it's a subjective endeavor and they may as well reconcile themselves to accepting who I am
11503,"17/07/18, 7:23:13 AM",Sush, Fair
11504,"17/07/18, 7:23:35 AM",Sush, Esp annoying because we’re expected to accept who they are
11505,"17/07/18, 7:23:40 AM",Sush, Without ‘judgement’
11506,"17/07/18, 7:28:04 AM",Pranathi, Yeah.
11507,"17/07/18, 7:28:11 AM",Pranathi, Gahhhh family's so complicated
11508,"17/07/18, 7:28:14 AM",Pranathi, Unnecessarily so.
11509,"17/07/18, 7:35:15 AM",Pranathi, I'm reading histories of African countries. I realized I know so little!
11510,"17/07/18, 8:11:15 AM",Pranathi, Uday informs me that you're also reading Open City
11511,"17/07/18, 8:11:22 AM",Pranathi," Gee thanks Uday, you've known Sush for half a sec hahaha"
11512,"17/07/18, 8:11:31 AM",Pranathi, OFC I know she's reading Open City
11513,"17/07/18, 8:11:38 AM",Pranathi, Aka me getting all possessive haha

11535,"17/07/18, 11:15:04 AM",Pranathi," They're like zero stakes, you can always say no"
11536,"17/07/18, 11:18:30 AM",Sush, meet off!

11562,"17/07/18, 11:35:59 AM",Pranathi, So she has to be at least somewhat progressive for a Tambrahm I thought
11563,"17/07/18, 11:37:44 AM",Sush, Correct
11564,"17/07/18, 11:37:46 AM",Sush, Paapa!

11567,"17/07/18, 11:38:05 AM",Pranathi, It gives some social insurance
11568,"17/07/18, 11:38:11 AM",Sush, true!
11569,"17/07/18, 11:38:19 AM",Sush, And like he can’t ghost you or anything
11570,"17/07/18, 11:38:42 AM",Sush, Can’t believe that’s an actual consideration lol
11571,"17/07/18, 11:38:48 AM",Pranathi, Haha I know right. That's so pathetic

12082,"20/07/18, 2:05:15 PM",Sush, easy to make off
12083,"20/07/18, 2:06:18 PM",Pranathi, Yum yum
12084,"20/07/18, 2:06:33 PM",Pranathi, I've had more paneer per day this past month than I did all of this past year put together
12085,"20/07/18, 2:06:48 PM",Pranathi, I'm almooooost sick of it
12086,"20/07/18, 2:07:20 PM",Pranathi, But not because that's high treason

12089,"20/07/18, 10:42:05 PM",Sush, Wtf!
12090,"20/07/18, 10:42:10 PM",Sush, what a little weirdo
12091,"20/07/18, 11:22:57 PM",Pranathi, Dude I'm going to stab this Uday also
12092,"20/07/18, 11:23:02 PM",Pranathi, He's so snarky about vegetarianism
12093,"20/07/18, 11:23:47 PM",Pranathi," He asked what I'm doing today and I said I'm going to Cream Center with this boy. He was like, ""Oh Cream Center, always a site of pure veg romance"""
12094,"20/07/18, 11:23:57 PM",Pranathi, It would be funny if I didn't know he hated vegetarianism visceraly
12095,"20/07/18, 11:24:02 PM",Pranathi, *viscerally
12096,"20/07/18, 11:24:14 PM",Pranathi, That one time I told you Sneha and I went over for dinner at his place? He didn't make anything veg!
12097,"20/07/18, 11:24:20 PM",Pranathi, He made some goat curry and chicken biryani
12098,"20/07/18, 11:24:27 PM",Pranathi, I told him I was vegetarian but he didn't give a shit
12099,"20/07/18, 11:24:30 PM",Sush, That is soooo rude!!
12100,"20/07/18, 11:24:36 PM",Sush, Don’t freaking invite then
12101,"20/07/18, 11:24:39 PM",Pranathi, Fortunately I had taken some pasta salad
12102,"20/07/18, 11:24:48 PM",Pranathi, Which he ate like 3/4ths of also
12103,"20/07/18, 11:24:51 PM",Pranathi, I was so mad that day
12104,"20/07/18, 11:25:06 PM",Sush, That is VERY rude
12105,"20/07/18, 11:25:26 PM",Pranathi, Yeah. He think he's fighting Brahminism or something
12106,"20/07/18, 11:25:31 PM",Pranathi, It's so misguided and terrible
12107,"20/07/18, 11:25:33 PM",Sush, Pah
12108,"20/07/18, 11:25:56 PM",Sush, He told me also that he grew up vegetarian but his Marxist rebellion made him eat him
12109,"20/07/18, 11:25:59 PM",Sush, K
12110,"20/07/18, 11:26:12 PM",Sush, Made him eat meat
12111,"20/07/18, 11:26:15 PM",Sush, Sorry 😂
12112,"20/07/18, 11:26:19 PM",Pranathi, Yeah I like how unironically calls himself a Marxist. Meaning I don't like it at all lol
12113,"20/07/18, 11:26:25 PM",Sush, 😂
12114,"20/07/18, 11:26:29 PM",Pranathi, HAHA that was a funny typo
12115,"20/07/18, 11:26:38 PM",Pranathi, He would've gotten along so well with these Arya Prakash types
12116,"20/07/18, 11:26:50 PM",Sush, Abacus school and Edinburgh
12117,"20/07/18, 11:26:54 PM",Pranathi, Chumma grandstanding about how woke he is by eating meat
12118,"20/07/18, 11:27:05 PM",Sush, Fertile breeding ground for Marxists
12119,"20/07/18, 11:27:09 PM",Pranathi, LOL
12120,"20/07/18, 11:27:32 PM",Pranathi, I'm annoyed at his whole condescension about vegetarians man
12121,"20/07/18, 11:27:38 PM",Pranathi, I almost want to tell him off
12122,"20/07/18, 11:27:45 PM",Sush, Tell him off!
12123,"20/07/18, 11:27:49 PM",Pranathi, He keeps doing it and I feel like he's goading me into saying something
12124,"20/07/18, 11:27:54 PM",Pranathi, But then he wins
12125,"20/07/18, 11:28:06 PM",Pranathi, Cause then he can make it about offended Brahmin being offended
12126,"20/07/18, 11:28:16 PM",Sush, Ya he probably thinks he’s pushing your boundaries for you 🤮
12127,"20/07/18, 11:28:23 PM",Pranathi, Grosssss
12128,"20/07/18, 11:28:25 PM",Pranathi, Men are so gross
12129,"20/07/18, 11:28:32 PM",Sush, They truly are
12130,"20/07/18, 11:28:41 PM",Pranathi, My brother and I were talking about this Comicstaan
12131,"20/07/18, 11:28:50 PM",Pranathi, You know it? Some stand up comedy reality show that's just released
12132,"20/07/18, 11:29:03 PM",Sush, Ya I’ve heard about it haven’t watched
12133,"20/07/18, 11:29:18 PM",Pranathi, And I said I hate when male stand up comedians yell with rage to be funny
12134,"20/07/18, 11:29:54 PM",Pranathi, As though they're not already entitled to displays of anger and rage otherwise
12135,"20/07/18, 11:30:10 PM",Pranathi, And it's frankly discomfiting to see a man being given a stage and being applauded to yell and scream and rant
12136,"20/07/18, 11:30:31 PM",Pranathi, Ofc my brother got annoyed and said I shouldn't make generalizations
12137,"20/07/18, 11:30:36 PM",Pranathi, 👍
12138,"20/07/18, 11:31:04 PM",Pranathi, Okay I'm just ranting now
12139,"20/07/18, 11:31:06 PM",Pranathi, How was dinner?!
12140,"20/07/18, 11:31:11 PM",Pranathi, Are they still there?
12141,"21/07/18, 1:02:52 AM",Sush, hiiii
12142,"21/07/18, 1:02:55 AM",Sush, sorry sorry!
12143,"21/07/18, 1:03:08 AM",Sush, rodrigo came over suddenly
12144,"21/07/18, 1:03:21 AM",Sush, stand up comedy is soooo gendered
12145,"21/07/18, 1:03:37 AM",Sush, like can you get thru one set without making masturbation gesture PLIS
12146,"21/07/18, 1:30:52 AM",Pranathi, Oooh Rodrigo
12147,"21/07/18, 1:30:55 AM",Pranathi, ;)
12148,"21/07/18, 1:31:29 AM",Pranathi, Yeah lol men's ostentatious displays of male sexuality are NOT funny. They're scary really
12149,"21/07/18, 1:31:37 AM",Pranathi, I'm going on date lolol
12150,"21/07/18, 1:31:42 AM",Pranathi, My arms are so hairy
12151,"[21/07/18, 1:32:28 AM",Pranathi, ‎image omitted
12152,"21/07/18, 1:46:40 AM",Sush, Oooh good luccckkk
12153,"21/07/18, 11:20:07 AM",Sush, How was ittttt
12154,"21/07/18, 11:20:31 AM",Sush, Tell me EVERYTHING!
12155,"21/07/18, 11:32:35 AM",Pranathi, HIII
12156,"21/07/18, 11:32:47 AM",Pranathi, It was actually way better than I expected
12157,"21/07/18, 11:32:51 AM",Pranathi, He seems really put together in life
12158,"21/07/18, 11:33:03 AM",Pranathi, He fashions himself as a tech dude. Which I can get onboard with mostly
12159,"21/07/18, 11:33:14 AM",Pranathi, But he seems to have fun. He likes to hike and all
12160,"21/07/18, 11:33:24 AM",Pranathi," And he plays tabla, so we talked about music for a long while"
12161,"21/07/18, 11:33:32 AM",Pranathi, He also seems really kind and decent and polite
12162,"21/07/18, 11:33:34 AM",Sush, Niiice!
12163,"21/07/18, 11:33:36 AM",Sush, Ayyy
12164,"21/07/18, 11:33:47 AM",Pranathi," And he's dated, is on online dating apps and all"
12165,"21/07/18, 11:34:00 AM",Pranathi, And it didn't seem like he was saying that was in the past. Like he's still doing all that simultaneously
12166,"21/07/18, 11:34:04 AM",Pranathi, Which made me feel relieved
12167,"21/07/18, 11:34:15 AM",Sush, That’s nice! So he’s also being chill about it
12168,"21/07/18, 11:34:20 AM",Pranathi," And we were able to talk honestly about this, and that there are like zero expectations"
12169,"21/07/18, 11:34:23 AM",Pranathi, I think we're on the same page
12170,"21/07/18, 11:34:29 AM",Pranathi, That we're seeing it just as our parents introducing us
12171,"21/07/18, 11:34:30 AM",Sush, How great!!
12172,"21/07/18, 11:34:40 AM",Pranathi, And we'll keep talking maybe but zero commitment or obligation
12173,"21/07/18, 11:34:40 AM",Sush, Did you feel attractions?
12174,"21/07/18, 11:34:45 AM",Pranathi, He seemed to be really into me
12175,"21/07/18, 11:34:56 AM",Sush, You are a catch!
12176,"21/07/18, 11:35:16 AM",Pranathi, I think I like him too but with lots of reservations. I don't know if that's just a natural response after everything and my total lack of trust in men
12177,"21/07/18, 11:35:29 AM",Pranathi, Or if it's me being overly critical of him
12178,"21/07/18, 11:35:32 AM",Sush, That is v fair
12179,"21/07/18, 11:35:33 AM",Pranathi, Some things he said I was like hmmm
12180,"21/07/18, 11:35:39 AM",Sush, Where does he live in America?
12181,"21/07/18, 11:35:53 AM",Pranathi, But I am also trying to not try to overanalyze what he said and form opinions right away
12182,"21/07/18, 11:36:01 AM",Pranathi, This was literally first meeting and he seemed mostly very lovely
12183,"21/07/18, 11:36:09 AM",Sush, So nice!
12184,"21/07/18, 11:36:15 AM",Pranathi, He lives in San Diego
12185,"21/07/18, 11:36:19 AM",Sush, I’m so glad you decided to meet him!!
12186,"21/07/18, 11:36:31 AM",Pranathi," And haha, thanks ya. ❤ I felt a little validated today!"
12187,"21/07/18, 11:36:43 AM",Pranathi, It was nice feeling like I could be around a guy and not want to sock him in the face
12188,"21/07/18, 11:36:51 AM",Sush, Hahaha!
12189,"21/07/18, 11:37:02 AM",Sush, Correct 😘
12190,"21/07/18, 11:37:21 AM",Pranathi, 
12191,"21/07/18, 11:37:32 AM",Pranathi," Or not, whenever it feels like one of us isn't interested anymore"
12192,"21/07/18, 11:37:36 AM",Sush, Very nice!
12193,"21/07/18, 11:37:39 AM",Pranathi, But he didn't even know the meaning of ghost
12194,"21/07/18, 11:37:42 AM",Sush, What did parents say
12195,"21/07/18, 11:37:54 AM",Sush, Hahaha
12196,"21/07/18, 11:38:02 AM",Pranathi, I told him about my experiences with online dating and Nick and all. He also told me some stuff. But he seems to be seedha saadha
12197,"21/07/18, 11:38:02 AM",Sush, Good sign 😂
12198,"21/07/18, 11:38:05 AM",Pranathi, Like no dumb stuff
12199,"21/07/18, 11:38:09 AM",Pranathi, Like ghosting
12200,"21/07/18, 11:38:15 AM",Sush, Ohh ya that’s good
12201,"21/07/18, 11:38:26 AM",Pranathi, My mom asked if everything was okay and it all went fine
12202,"21/07/18, 11:38:29 AM",Pranathi, I said ya
12203,"21/07/18, 11:38:42 AM",Pranathi, She seemed mostly relieved because she had guilt that she made me feel trapped or something apparently
12204,"21/07/18, 11:38:48 AM",Pranathi," I said no no, it was a fun afternoon only"
12205,"21/07/18, 11:38:54 AM",Pranathi, And then she left it
12206,"21/07/18, 11:39:04 AM",Sush, Good good 
12207,"21/07/18, 11:39:05 AM",Pranathi," It was fairly miraculous, her level of chill"
12208,"21/07/18, 11:39:10 AM",Pranathi, Dad didn't really talk about it
12209,"21/07/18, 11:39:11 AM",Sush, That’s amazing
12210,"21/07/18, 11:39:19 AM",Pranathi, But he'll probably ask my mom and divine thusly
12211,"21/07/18, 11:39:27 AM",Pranathi, He's too awkward to talk to me about boys
12212,"21/07/18, 11:39:46 AM",Pranathi, So I am also mostly glad I met him. He seems very chill and down to earth
12213,"21/07/18, 11:39:55 AM",Pranathi," A little paavam though, which worries me"
12214,"21/07/18, 11:40:03 AM",Pranathi, But it's okay. He doesn't seem judgmental about what I might do
12215,"21/07/18, 11:40:04 AM",Pranathi, I think!
12216,"21/07/18, 11:40:24 AM",Sush, Yeah as long as he’s choosing to be paavam!
12217,"21/07/18, 11:40:59 AM",Pranathi," Yes, I think so. I can't figure out his whole moral compass yet"
12218,"21/07/18, 11:41:12 AM",Pranathi, The way he talked about money was like he really enjoys having it
12219,"21/07/18, 11:41:21 AM",Pranathi, He saved quite a bit of it from when he worked for Microsoft from what I gather
12220,"21/07/18, 11:41:23 AM",Pranathi, And he likes spending it
12221,"21/07/18, 11:41:37 AM",Sush, Did it sound like nick/Tara?
12222,"21/07/18, 11:41:40 AM",Pranathi, I don't know how he felt when I told him I'm basically broke and I have no savings
12223,"21/07/18, 11:41:54 AM",Pranathi," He didn't respond, but I don't think his silence meant he was judging me"
12224,"21/07/18, 11:42:13 AM",Pranathi," He could've been, but I can't say it was definitely dhuddu aasai like them. Maybe he was just quiet out of respect also"
12225,"21/07/18, 11:42:21 AM",Pranathi, Like what to say when someone says they're broke?
12226,"21/07/18, 11:42:25 AM",Sush, True
12227,"21/07/18, 11:42:36 AM",Sush, ‘don’t worry’ is condescending
12228,"21/07/18, 11:42:50 AM",Pranathi, He doesn't read fiction!
12229,"21/07/18, 11:42:52 AM",Sush, There is really no correct response
12230,"21/07/18, 11:42:52 AM",Pranathi, That also bothers me
12231,"21/07/18, 11:43:01 AM",Pranathi, But I can't control someone's hobbies
12232,"21/07/18, 11:43:07 AM",Pranathi, And he seems fairly aware of the world at large
12233,"21/07/18, 11:43:10 AM",Sush, Haha 😂
12234,"21/07/18, 11:43:14 AM",Pranathi, I just don't know if he has that creative impulse
12235,"21/07/18, 11:43:26 AM",Sush, yaaa I’m also mildly skeptical when people don’t fiction
12236,"21/07/18, 11:43:38 AM",Sush, Does he like tv cinema etc tho?
12237,"21/07/18, 11:43:57 AM",Pranathi, Yeah. We didn't get around to talking about it although he mentioned in his email that he does TV movies etc.
12238,"21/07/18, 11:44:03 AM",Pranathi, We talked a lot a lot a lot
12239,"21/07/18, 11:44:09 AM",Pranathi, I liked that conversation barely flagged and time flew by
12240,"21/07/18, 11:44:13 AM",Sush, Very good!!
12241,"21/07/18, 11:44:17 AM",Pranathi, We spoke from 12 to 4
12242,"21/07/18, 11:44:22 AM",Sush, Lovely!
12243,"21/07/18, 11:44:27 AM",Sush, So many boys can’t do that
12244,"21/07/18, 11:44:42 AM",Pranathi, I know. It was just a relief to not sit there goading him and prodding him into answering questions
12245,"21/07/18, 11:44:45 AM",Pranathi, Just to have something to do there
12246,"21/07/18, 11:45:00 AM",Sush, I can imagine!!
12247,"21/07/18, 11:45:02 AM",Pranathi, I like his sister a lot!
12248,"21/07/18, 11:45:08 AM",Pranathi, I don't even know her but she seems super similar to me
12249,"21/07/18, 11:45:17 AM",Sush, Northwestern girl?
12250,"21/07/18, 11:45:21 AM",Pranathi, Even he was slightly taken aback by how similar we seemed apparently
12251,"21/07/18, 11:45:25 AM",Sush, He should visit her lol
12252,"21/07/18, 11:45:26 AM",Pranathi, Yeah Sociology girl at Northwestern
12253,"21/07/18, 11:45:35 AM",Pranathi, And she got hired at Carleton as assistant prof just now
12254,"21/07/18, 11:45:46 AM",Pranathi, She's defending this winter
12255,"21/07/18, 11:45:55 AM",Sush, How fancy!
12256,"21/07/18, 11:46:05 AM",Sush, For some reason I assumed she was undergrad
12257,"21/07/18, 11:46:09 AM",Pranathi, Yeah haha. He also told me to visit if things pick up etc. He said San Diego is really chill and he'd be happy to host me
12258,"21/07/18, 11:46:15 AM",Pranathi, No she's older than him
12259,"21/07/18, 11:46:19 AM",Pranathi, Akka
12260,"21/07/18, 11:46:24 AM",Sush, Nice!
12261,"21/07/18, 11:46:39 AM",Pranathi, I would like to visit San Diego and get free acco
12262,"21/07/18, 11:46:41 AM",Pranathi, But we'll see lol
12263,"21/07/18, 11:46:49 AM",Pranathi, He's endlessly on probation
12264,"21/07/18, 11:46:57 AM",Pranathi, I expect him to do something to shoot himself in the foot
12265,"21/07/18, 11:46:59 AM",Sush, Correct 😂
12266,"21/07/18, 11:47:08 AM",Sush, Can’t hurt to be wary
12267,"21/07/18, 11:47:25 AM",Pranathi, Yeah I told him I would be
12268,"21/07/18, 11:47:28 AM",Pranathi, Lol
12269,"21/07/18, 11:47:40 AM",Pranathi, I was upfront about everything when he asked.
12270,"21/07/18, 11:47:59 AM",Pranathi, Which was nice for me because I didn't feel the need to skirt around some of the stuff I would normally on a first date
12271,"21/07/18, 11:48:13 AM",Pranathi, He felt easy to talk to. Although I noticed he doesn't curse at all
12272,"21/07/18, 11:48:25 AM",Pranathi, His eyes widened every time I said fuck. Which wasn't that many times as a result
12273,"21/07/18, 11:48:44 AM",Pranathi, I have to go talk to my grandmother for just a bit. I will brb.

12284,"21/07/18, 9:01:29 PM",Pranathi, Yummmm I still haven't tried your palak paneer I think!
12285,"21/07/18, 9:02:02 PM",Pranathi, That sounds like a very fun time. 
12286,"21/07/18, 9:02:31 PM",Pranathi, Did Rodrigo ask for poori again? 
12287,"21/07/18, 9:03:09 PM",Pranathi, I wish I was there for Pitchfork!
12288,"21/07/18, 9:03:21 PM",Pranathi, I see pictures and it looks like fun
12289,"21/07/18, 9:56:31 PM",Sush, Yaaay!

12291,"21/07/18, 9:56:55 PM",Sush, I think I can’t hang out with him without her 😅
12292,"21/07/18, 9:57:06 PM",Pranathi, Hahaha
12293,"21/07/18, 9:57:13 PM",Pranathi, Too boring?
12294,"21/07/18, 9:57:23 PM",Pranathi, Which movie?
12295,"21/07/18, 9:58:23 PM",Sush, It’s just awkward I think
12296,"21/07/18, 9:58:28 PM",Sush, And she is so much more fun lol
12297,"21/07/18, 9:58:37 PM",Sush, Nayak

12301,"21/07/18, 9:59:07 PM",Pranathi, Women are so much more interesting
12302,"21/07/18, 9:59:21 PM",Pranathi, I wish we were attracted to them
12303,"21/07/18, 9:59:37 PM",Pranathi, Ooh yeah I saw it was playing
12304,"21/07/18, 10:00:00 PM",Sush, I know lol

12307,"21/07/18, 10:00:19 PM",Sush, Ya I learned for a little over a year
12308,"21/07/18, 10:00:23 PM",Pranathi, It's so hard to remember languages you learned as a kid!
12309,"21/07/18, 10:00:27 PM",Sush, Third language
12310,"21/07/18, 10:00:35 PM",Pranathi, I learned Spanish for a year as a kid and barely remember anything
12311,"21/07/18, 10:00:44 PM",Pranathi, Unless you practice at home ofc
12312,"21/07/18, 10:00:47 PM",Sush, Ya it’s hard to remember unless you’re in touch
12313,"21/07/18, 10:00:50 PM",Sush, Correct
12314,"21/07/18, 10:00:57 PM",Sush, Maybe I should learn Bangla again
12315,"21/07/18, 10:01:03 PM",Sush, Or just learn to read Tamil!
12316,"21/07/18, 10:01:06 PM",Pranathi, Hey you remember I was raving about Jonathan Gold?
12317,"21/07/18, 10:01:11 PM",Pranathi, One food writer?
12318,"21/07/18, 10:01:16 PM",Pranathi, He died 
12319,"21/07/18, 10:01:29 PM",Pranathi, And yeah I also want to learn Tamil formally!
12320,"21/07/18, 10:02:21 PM",Pranathi, I think it's a pity I was in Chennai for so long and I didn't learn Tamil at school
12321,"21/07/18, 10:02:29 PM",Sush, Ohh 
12322,"21/07/18, 10:02:33 PM",Sush, Paapa was he old?
12323,"21/07/18, 10:02:41 PM",Pranathi, No he was 57
12324,"21/07/18, 10:02:42 PM",Sush, We’ll learn together if I stay in Chicago!
12325,"21/07/18, 10:02:49 PM",Sush, Oh man how did he die!
12326,"21/07/18, 10:02:52 PM",Pranathi, Yesss that would be so nice
12327,"21/07/18, 10:02:55 PM",Pranathi, Pancreatic cancer
12328,"21/07/18, 10:02:59 PM",Sush, Paapa!
12329,"21/07/18, 10:03:12 PM",Pranathi, No? I feel so sorry. I felt like he spoke to my soul
12330,"21/07/18, 10:03:24 PM",Pranathi," So intense, but true! His writing was so beautiful"
12331,"21/07/18, 10:04:05 PM",Sush, I will google him
12332,"[21/07/18, 10:05:13 PM",Pranathi, ‎image omitted
12333,"21/07/18, 10:05:25 PM",Pranathi, Sorry I'm going on about this 
12334,"21/07/18, 10:05:39 PM",Pranathi, I just got my period today and I am feeling heavily hormonal
12335,"21/07/18, 10:05:41 PM",Sush, So evocative!
12336,"21/07/18, 10:06:07 PM",Pranathi," No? Especially as a vegetarian, it creates a whole rich world of images and sensations"
12337,"21/07/18, 10:06:21 PM",Sush, Yeah!
12338,"21/07/18, 10:06:31 PM",Sush, I’ve never really been into food writing tho
12339,"21/07/18, 10:06:53 PM",Sush, Maybe I haven’t read the right writing
12340,"21/07/18, 10:07:08 PM",Pranathi, Yeah and it's also a funny medium
12341,"21/07/18, 10:07:20 PM",Pranathi, Food is something you taste and smell and see
12342,"21/07/18, 10:07:35 PM",Pranathi," So it's a hard thing to do, to translate that into writing"
12343,"21/07/18, 10:07:39 PM",Pranathi, Hard to do it well anyway
12344,"21/07/18, 10:07:42 PM",Sush, True!
12345,"21/07/18, 10:07:58 PM",Sush, I like food writing when it’s about a person I guess
12346,"21/07/18, 10:08:17 PM",Sush, Like a person’s relationship with food is such a personal window into who they are
12347,"21/07/18, 10:08:49 PM",Pranathi, Makes sense!
12348,"21/07/18, 10:08:56 PM",Pranathi, It's such a primal connection
12349,"21/07/18, 10:09:01 PM",Pranathi, What you're doing!
12350,"21/07/18, 10:15:35 PM",Sush, I’m doing little bit work
12351,"21/07/18, 10:15:42 PM",Sush, Then will go for walk with Rodrigo
12352,"21/07/18, 10:16:21 PM",Pranathi, So cute!
12353,"21/07/18, 10:16:30 PM",Pranathi, Have a nice walk ❤
12354,"21/07/18, 10:39:06 PM",Sush, what are you doing with your grandmommmm
12355,"21/07/18, 11:19:45 PM",Pranathi, Not much! I'm actually trying to work
12356,"21/07/18, 11:19:50 PM",Pranathi, But it's so frustrating
12357,"21/07/18, 11:20:00 PM",Pranathi, Marco just emailed me saying he needs all the maps in crazy high res
12358,"21/07/18, 11:20:17 PM",Pranathi, But my map projects are on the desktop of a lab computer on campus
12359,"21/07/18, 11:20:24 PM",Pranathi, So I have to wait till I get back
12360,"21/07/18, 11:20:48 PM",Pranathi," Except he's being really impatient. Which I also think is slightly unfair since he didn't tell me this stuff, and he told me I'm done with maps stuff, so I didn't bring that work with me"
12361,"21/07/18, 11:21:15 PM",Pranathi," Plus I could've worked on it if I'd saved it to the cloud as I thought I had, but I think that upload failed. Each of these project files is maaaasssive"
12362,"21/07/18, 11:21:34 PM",Pranathi," Sorry all random ranting basically, but I'm just stressing about work and about coming back and having to take care of myself again lol"
12363,"22/07/18, 12:32:01 AM",Sush, ayyo that's annoying!
12364,"22/07/18, 12:32:14 AM",Sush, let me know if it's anything i can go and  upload for you?
12365,"22/07/18, 12:32:58 AM",Pranathi, It will be very stressful to find someone to let you in and to find the folder and all I think. 
12366,"22/07/18, 12:33:07 AM",Pranathi, I really appreciate you offering though ❤ That is so very kind!
12367,"22/07/18, 12:33:29 AM",Sush, Let me know if you need me to anyway tho ❤
12368,"22/07/18, 12:33:28 AM",Pranathi," If it was not summer, I could've asked Austin but everyone's away now"
12369,"22/07/18, 12:33:38 AM",Sush, ohh
12370,"22/07/18, 12:33:41 AM",Pranathi, I willllll thank you so muchhhh

12376,"22/07/18, 12:34:11 AM",Sush, so i dragged rodrigo to the law school
12377,"22/07/18, 12:34:18 AM",Pranathi, Did you?
12378,"22/07/18, 12:34:19 AM",Sush, but it was drained 😢😢😢
12379,"22/07/18, 12:34:22 AM",Pranathi, Splash I mean
12380,"22/07/18, 12:34:23 AM",Pranathi, Oh no!

12382,"22/07/18, 12:34:33 AM",Pranathi, Summer?
12383,"22/07/18, 12:35:11 AM",Sush, i think because tomorrow is sunday maybe

12385,"22/07/18, 12:35:28 AM",Sush, maybe they clean / change on sundays or something
12386,"22/07/18, 12:35:40 AM",Pranathi, Ohh makes sense. So annoying though!
12387,"22/07/18, 12:35:42 AM",Pranathi, I wish we could go to the lake late at night
12388,"22/07/18, 12:35:44 AM",Pranathi, It would be so nice
12389,"22/07/18, 12:35:50 AM",Sush, yaaa i hyped it so much for rodrigo lol

12392,"22/07/18, 12:36:04 AM",Pranathi, He always does such cute things with you
12393,"22/07/18, 12:36:11 AM",Sush, then we made up stories about the random art there
12394,"22/07/18, 12:36:34 AM",Sush, he called some corner the heart of the mayan civilization 
12395,"22/07/18, 12:37:25 AM",Pranathi, What hahaha
12396,"22/07/18, 12:37:28 AM",Pranathi, So funny that boy
12397,"22/07/18, 12:37:40 AM",Pranathi, Does he like Coco?
12398,"22/07/18, 12:37:46 AM",Pranathi, I feel like I could see him as that little boy
12399,"22/07/18, 12:37:52 AM",Sush, hahaahaha!
12400,"22/07/18, 12:37:55 AM",Sush, yeah! he does!
12401,"22/07/18, 12:38:03 AM",Pranathi, Like when he was a kutti payyan

12403,"22/07/18, 12:38:16 AM",Sush," and also like, observe it!"
12404,"22/07/18, 12:38:19 AM",Sush, it seems so lovely
12405,"22/07/18, 12:38:30 AM",Pranathi, Yeah! It's such a lovely concept
12406,"22/07/18, 12:38:42 AM",Pranathi, The Pilsen festival is happening in August I think!
12407,"22/07/18, 12:38:48 AM",Pranathi, We should go see
12408,"22/07/18, 12:43:08 AM",Sush, what they'll do in pilsen festival?
12409,"22/07/18, 12:43:27 AM",Sush, i'm very confused by these festivals
12410,"22/07/18, 12:43:36 AM",Sush, there was something on 53rd street today
12411,"22/07/18, 12:43:50 AM",Pranathi, Haan? Block party or something?
12412,"22/07/18, 12:43:52 AM",Pranathi, Why confused?
12413,"22/07/18, 12:44:01 AM",Sush," ya,  block party"
12414,"22/07/18, 12:44:16 AM",Sush," like, i never know what to do "
12415,"22/07/18, 12:44:37 AM",Pranathi, Lolol
12416,"22/07/18, 12:44:51 AM",Pranathi, I think it's just to go there and eat food and yell to friends over the loud music
12417,"22/07/18, 12:44:59 AM",Pranathi, And pay for things that you think you need but definitely don't
12418,"22/07/18, 12:45:05 AM",Sush, 😂
12419,"22/07/18, 12:45:11 AM",Pranathi," In other words, it's a chance for them to make revenue off of you"
12420,"22/07/18, 12:45:18 AM",Pranathi, Convincing you into thinking you're having fun
12421,"22/07/18, 12:45:19 AM",Pranathi, Lol
12422,"22/07/18, 12:45:20 AM",Sush, ok that's fair 😂
12423,"22/07/18, 12:45:24 AM",Pranathi, 
12424,"22/07/18, 12:45:29 AM",Pranathi, Sad no.
12425,"22/07/18, 12:45:33 AM",Sush, lolol
12426,"22/07/18, 12:45:37 AM",Pranathi, Festivals are nothing like festivals here.
12427,"22/07/18, 12:45:44 AM",Sush, YEAH

12429,"22/07/18, 12:45:52 AM",Pranathi, There's a buzz in the air
12430,"22/07/18, 12:45:57 AM",Sush, i'm always like ugh so noise and crowd and traffic
12431,"22/07/18, 12:46:09 AM",Sush, i guess christmas and july 4 and thanksgiving etc are like that

12441,"22/07/18, 12:54:05 AM",Pranathi, And yessss I would love a Diwali party!
12442,"22/07/18, 12:54:11 AM",Sush, i think mostly because my mama made it v fun!
12443,"22/07/18, 12:54:26 AM",Sush, he's a bit of a pyromaniac!
12444,"22/07/18, 12:56:59 AM",Pranathi, So lovely! This is the naughty uncle your mom was talking about no?
12445,"22/07/18, 12:57:20 AM",Sush, that's her cousin 
12446,"22/07/18, 12:57:24 AM",Pranathi, I am feeling very indignant about my house right now. My mom still follows the old don't come into kitchen or puja room rule when I'm on my period
12447,"22/07/18, 12:57:24 AM",Sush, this is her younger brother
12448,"22/07/18, 12:57:30 AM",Sush, but he's as bad
12449,"22/07/18, 12:57:31 AM",Pranathi, She says she doesn't care but it's because of the koil
12450,"22/07/18, 12:57:36 AM",Sush, together they're awful
12451,"22/07/18, 12:57:36 AM",Pranathi, And what will people think.
12452,"22/07/18, 12:57:38 AM",Sush, ayyo!
12453,"22/07/18, 12:57:44 AM",Sush, that's v annoying
12454,"22/07/18, 12:57:45 AM",Pranathi, It makes me so mad so sad so humiliated
12455,"22/07/18, 12:58:00 AM",Sush, how will 'people' even know
12456,"22/07/18, 12:58:15 AM",Pranathi, We had a fight about it last time when I tried to engage. She said it's not personal but she can't make exceptions for me because it's unfair
12457,"22/07/18, 12:58:33 AM",Pranathi, Lol unfair it seems
12458,"22/07/18, 12:58:35 AM",Pranathi, I hate it so much
12459,"22/07/18, 12:58:41 AM",Sush, that's nuts it's literally your house
12460,"22/07/18, 12:58:58 AM",Pranathi, Yeah. It makes me feel really upset at her
12461,"22/07/18, 12:59:01 AM",Pranathi, And resentful
12462,"22/07/18, 12:59:08 AM",Pranathi, Like how could she do that to her own daughter
12463,"22/07/18, 1:00:12 AM",Pranathi, Anyway. I leave in less than 10 days so it's okay I guess
12464,"22/07/18, 1:00:58 AM",Sush, it's so hard to shake these things up!
12465,"22/07/18, 1:01:26 AM",Pranathi, I'm writing about it because I don't know how else to let go of the rage I'm feeling about it
12466,"22/07/18, 1:01:51 AM",Sush, fair 
12467,"22/07/18, 1:02:12 AM",Sush, 'Adulthood is completely understanding why Britney Spears shaved her head'
12468,"22/07/18, 1:02:53 AM",Pranathi, HAHA.
12469,"22/07/18, 1:03:02 AM",Pranathi, Did you come up with this?
12470,"22/07/18, 1:03:05 AM",Pranathi, Brilliant.
12471,"22/07/18, 1:09:04 AM",Pranathi, Can I send you what I wrote!
12472,"22/07/18, 1:11:41 AM",Pranathi, Actually never mind haha it is just whining anyway
12473,"22/07/18, 1:11:51 AM",Pranathi, I had one of my interviewees reschedule again

12654,"22/07/18, 11:35:21 AM",Pranathi, Actually who am I kidding. I'd have to have so much more talent to do music lol
12655,"22/07/18, 11:35:43 AM",Pranathi," Anyway, I don't think he's that cute. He's very small made. Which always is a turn off with me for men"

12793,"22/07/18, 12:57:23 PM",Sush, it's so fucking rude to ask someone to JUSTIFY their choices to you
12794,"22/07/18, 12:57:39 PM",Sush, mohar asked me 1000 questions about whether my degree was worth the time and money
12795,"22/07/18, 12:57:42 PM",Sush, like wtf - who ARE you
12796,"22/07/18, 12:57:47 PM",Pranathi, Wtf who the hell IS he?

12798,"22/07/18, 12:57:59 PM",Pranathi, Never heard this name. Sounds like one choot
12799,"22/07/18, 12:58:03 PM",Pranathi, MORON MOHAR
12800,"22/07/18, 12:58:06 PM",Sush, ya!
12801,"22/07/18, 12:58:10 PM",Sush, chetana's friend no wonder
12802,"22/07/18, 12:58:11 PM",Pranathi, Roll you in MORTAR
12803,"22/07/18, 12:58:17 PM",Pranathi, can't believe he did that ugh
12804,"22/07/18, 12:58:18 PM",Sush, it was SO ANNOYING
12805,"22/07/18, 12:58:26 PM",Sush, i was almost in tears
12806,"22/07/18, 12:58:34 PM",Pranathi, Awwww baby!!!
12807,"22/07/18, 12:58:42 PM",Sush, and haylee and chelsea and nina also stressed me out a bit
12808,"22/07/18, 12:58:48 PM",Pranathi, Noooo what's wrong with this fool
12809,"22/07/18, 12:58:51 PM",Sush, nina is reacting weirdly to their jobs
12810,"22/07/18, 12:58:58 PM",Pranathi, Means?
12811,"22/07/18, 12:58:59 PM",Sush, she wants to go to business school it seems
12812,"22/07/18, 12:59:05 PM",Sush, like all of a sudden
12813,"22/07/18, 12:59:19 PM",Sush, because she is surrounded by people making $$
12814,"22/07/18, 12:59:33 PM",Sush, i'm like i'm fucking unemployed till sept can we not
12815,"22/07/18, 12:59:40 PM",Sush, and we spent like 2 HOURS talking about it
12816,"22/07/18, 12:59:53 PM",Pranathi, Omg that sounds awful. 
12817,"22/07/18, 1:00:08 PM",Pranathi, Do they not realize that you'd feel awful listening to them?
12818,"22/07/18, 1:00:14 PM",Pranathi, That sounds very entitled and selfish
12819,"22/07/18, 1:00:20 PM",Pranathi, Sorry if that's out of line but it is
12820,"22/07/18, 1:00:26 PM",Sush, they keep saying i don't actually have to worry
12821,"22/07/18, 1:00:41 PM",Sush, because there is no diff between their profiles and mine and it's just a matter of time
12822,"22/07/18, 1:01:04 PM",Sush, haylee was like i have ZERO concern for you because i'm 100% sure you'll land something you like
12823,"22/07/18, 1:01:08 PM",Pranathi," That's condescending though. Because whatever the case, you are worrying right now and that is valid"
12824,"22/07/18, 1:01:20 PM",Sush, but for nina it's like she doesn't have 'money-making skillset' or something
12825,"22/07/18, 1:01:25 PM",Sush, idk
12826,"22/07/18, 1:01:26 PM",Pranathi, You don't have to brush your anxieties aside because they'd rather not hear it
12827,"22/07/18, 1:01:45 PM",Sush, yeah - they're very good at building me up when i'm anxious
12828,"22/07/18, 1:01:52 PM",Sush, but nina's anxiety was triggering for me
12829,"22/07/18, 1:02:14 PM",Pranathi," Or maybe they do, I don't know if I'm speaking with very little knowledge of them or what happened. But I can imagine that it was stressful to hear them go on about it"
12830,"22/07/18, 1:02:23 PM",Sush, it was v stressful!
12831,"22/07/18, 1:02:35 PM",Pranathi," Like, now is not the time Nina"
12832,"22/07/18, 1:02:41 PM",Sush, and nina's being kinda silly about it also
12833,"22/07/18, 1:02:58 PM",Pranathi, She's just sad that everyone else is getting jobs or something?
12834,"22/07/18, 1:03:10 PM",Pranathi, Isn't she getting $$ too?
12835,"22/07/18, 1:03:21 PM",Sush," no, she works as a research analyst or something at booth"
12836,"22/07/18, 1:03:33 PM",Sush, and she has a history masters
12837,"22/07/18, 1:03:42 PM",Sush, she makes ~ $50k
12838,"22/07/18, 1:03:49 PM",Sush, which isn't bad at all!
12839,"22/07/18, 1:03:59 PM",Pranathi, Yeah!! I'd love that kind Do money
12840,"22/07/18, 1:04:03 PM",Pranathi, *of

12842,"22/07/18, 1:04:17 PM",Pranathi, Especially with a history masters
12843,"22/07/18, 1:04:26 PM",Sush, she's comparing with haylee and chelsea which is silly
12844,"22/07/18, 1:04:37 PM",Sush, it's a whole other industry
12845,"22/07/18, 1:04:38 PM",Sush, ALSo

12849,"22/07/18, 1:05:59 PM",Sush, no judgement but it's interesting that that seems to be a given
12850,"22/07/18, 1:06:16 PM",Pranathi, So interextingggg
12851,"22/07/18, 1:06:25 PM",Pranathi, How did that come up?
12852,"22/07/18, 1:06:35 PM",Sush, we were talking about long term plans
12853,"22/07/18, 1:06:45 PM",Sush, and they kinda plan their careers for the next 5 years
12854,"22/07/18, 1:06:47 PM",Sush, 'until babies'
12855,"22/07/18, 1:08:53 PM",Pranathi, So interesting
12856,"22/07/18, 1:08:58 PM",Pranathi, Did they ask about your plans?
12857,"22/07/18, 1:09:11 PM",Pranathi, That's kind of stressful in its own way
12858,"22/07/18, 1:09:19 PM",Sush, ya they were asking about how my parents managed to make a 2-working-parents family work
12859,"22/07/18, 1:09:25 PM",Sush, which was so interesting to me
12860,"22/07/18, 1:09:43 PM",Pranathi, Paavam this whole conversation sounds so intense!
12861,"22/07/18, 1:09:49 PM",Sush, it was lol

12868,"22/07/18, 1:10:51 PM",Pranathi," Like hey, this is going to happen, trigger warning"

12874,"22/07/18, 1:11:09 PM",Pranathi, That's fair
12875,"22/07/18, 1:11:34 PM",Pranathi," I think I would feel insecure if everyone around me was like minting money too, but also I know what I've gotten myself into"
12876,"22/07/18, 1:11:47 PM",Pranathi," Like sociology is not for making money, and history is definitely not"
12877,"22/07/18, 1:12:12 PM",Sush," ya....similarly for H&C, no point comparing with engineers / finance junta"
12878,"22/07/18, 1:12:14 PM",Pranathi, But it's hard to reconcile that I guess with the reality of earning less than friends if money matters that much
12879,"22/07/18, 1:12:35 PM",Pranathi, What's H&C again?
12880,"22/07/18, 1:12:42 PM",Sush, haylee and chelsea hahaha sorry
12881,"22/07/18, 1:12:54 PM",Pranathi, Oh lolol I thought it was some type of job
12882,"22/07/18, 1:13:00 PM",Pranathi, I was very confused
12883,"22/07/18, 1:13:01 PM",Sush, sometimes i'm also like i'm _never_ going to make nearly as much money as vinay or pojo
12884,"22/07/18, 1:13:25 PM",Pranathi, Yeah probably true. But that's not the benchmark anyway
12885,"22/07/18, 1:13:44 PM",Pranathi, And you're probably going to come damn close to it
12886,"22/07/18, 1:13:58 PM",Sush, nah - they'll be making like 2x what i make easily
12887,"22/07/18, 1:14:03 PM",Pranathi," Considering insti, I don't think I'd have expected any of us to make even regular money"
12888,"22/07/18, 1:14:12 PM",Pranathi, Let alone better than decent money
12889,"22/07/18, 1:14:26 PM",Pranathi," Oh yeah, I have no conception of what they'd make tbh haha"
12890,"22/07/18, 1:15:01 PM",Sush, dude they were talking about how 100k+ jobs were a compromise for more leisure as opposed to 200k+ jobs where they'd be working all the time 
12891,"22/07/18, 1:15:15 PM",Pranathi, 
12892,"22/07/18, 1:15:18 PM",Pranathi, 
12893,"22/07/18, 1:15:24 PM",Sush, they were talking of like a 5 year horizon
12894,"22/07/18, 1:15:28 PM",Sush, not right out of school
12895,"22/07/18, 1:15:31 PM",Sush, but still 
12896,"22/07/18, 1:15:36 PM",Sush, i'll _never_ make that much lol
12897,"22/07/18, 1:15:56 PM",Pranathi, I am here wondering whether to retweet this conference hashtag because that is the chunda semblance of pride this dumb academia offers me
12898,"22/07/18, 1:16:01 PM",Pranathi, And that is LAAAAAME
12899,"22/07/18, 1:16:10 PM",Sush, PLEASE DO
12900,"22/07/18, 1:16:21 PM",Sush, i will retweet so proudly
12901,"22/07/18, 1:16:40 PM",Pranathi, no I mean like money is not even a consideration and these people are talking about 100k like it is some petty cash
12902,"22/07/18, 1:16:43 PM",Pranathi, So funny haha
12903,"22/07/18, 1:16:48 PM",Sush, ya no?!
12904,"22/07/18, 1:16:55 PM",Pranathi, But yesss I just did like one braggy dummy
12905,"22/07/18, 1:16:59 PM",Pranathi, 🙈
12906,"22/07/18, 1:17:02 PM",Sush, if i _ever_ get 100k i'll be like 🤑🤑🤑🤑
12907,"22/07/18, 1:17:16 PM",Sush, 💰💸💸💲
12908,"22/07/18, 1:17:19 PM",Pranathi, If I get 100k I'm booking Europe trip the minute I do
12909,"22/07/18, 1:17:29 PM",Pranathi, Spain here I come
12910,"22/07/18, 1:17:35 PM",Sush, yes indeeeeeed
12911,"22/07/18, 1:17:37 PM",Pranathi, Lolol so funny people with money are
12912,"22/07/18, 1:17:42 PM",Sush, i'll get laser treatment done
12913,"22/07/18, 1:17:46 PM",Sush, i'm so lame -_-
12914,"22/07/18, 1:18:09 PM",Pranathi, Even this Shravan was telling me he doesn't think about spending money because he has so much of it
12915,"22/07/18, 1:18:20 PM",Pranathi, I don't think that was braggy
12916,"22/07/18, 1:18:28 PM",Pranathi, But it was the natural ease of the well cushioned
12917,"22/07/18, 1:18:32 PM",Pranathi, If that makes sense
12918,"22/07/18, 1:18:37 PM",Pranathi, Haha nooo that's also fair
12919,"22/07/18, 1:18:37 PM",Sush, yeah that makes sense
12920,"22/07/18, 1:18:49 PM",Pranathi, I should want to get my acne scars removed
12921,"22/07/18, 1:18:54 PM",Sush, my desires are also so lame lol
12922,"22/07/18, 1:18:59 PM",Pranathi, But I've kind of accepted that they're part of my face now
12923,"22/07/18, 1:19:08 PM",Pranathi, Just because I can't actually do anything about them
12924,"22/07/18, 1:19:17 PM",Sush, laser treatment will help my nasty bumps apparently
12925,"22/07/18, 1:19:31 PM",Pranathi, The ingrown hair sitch?
12926,"22/07/18, 1:19:35 PM",Sush, so it might spare me a good bit of pain
12927,"22/07/18, 1:19:36 PM",Sush, ya!
12928,"22/07/18, 1:19:38 PM",Pranathi, I saw some ad for something called fur
12929,"22/07/18, 1:19:42 PM",Sush, fur oil!
12930,"22/07/18, 1:19:50 PM",Sush, ya i've seen
12931,"22/07/18, 1:19:53 PM",Pranathi, Which is some oil to prevent ingrown hairs or something
12932,"22/07/18, 1:20:01 PM",Pranathi, I don't know how well it works tho
12933,"22/07/18, 1:20:13 PM",Pranathi, I saw this damn scary article about birth contro
12934,"22/07/18, 1:20:17 PM",Pranathi, Control
12935,"22/07/18, 1:20:32 PM",Pranathi, This digital thing that actually got so many women pregnant
12936,"22/07/18, 1:20:35 PM",Pranathi, False claim birth control
12937,"22/07/18, 1:21:16 PM",Sush, wtfff
12938,"22/07/18, 3:00:27 PM",Sush, dude
12939,"22/07/18, 3:00:32 PM",Sush, my apartment continues to plague me
12940,"22/07/18, 3:00:34 PM",Sush, the old one
12941,"22/07/18, 9:27:16 PM",Pranathi, Hi just woke up!
12942,"22/07/18, 9:35:59 PM",Pranathi, What happened?
12943,"22/07/18, 11:35:22 PM",Sush, i think i'm sad haylee is going away also!
12944,"22/07/18, 11:35:31 PM",Sush," and like, it's the end of an era of sorts"
12945,"22/07/18, 11:35:42 PM",Sush, which ALSO triggers the fact that idk what MY next era is
12946,"22/07/18, 11:41:31 PM",Sush, like i know it'll be fine
12947,"22/07/18, 11:41:45 PM",Sush, and i'm trying not be like it's not FAIR that idk yet why can't i just have a fun holiday
12948,"22/07/18, 11:41:54 PM",Sush, because that's spoiled and entitled
12949,"22/07/18, 11:42:00 PM",Sush, and not constructive
12950,"22/07/18, 11:46:33 PM",Pranathi," Yeah, all those feelings are totally valid and I would be as upset if I were in the same place!"
12951,"22/07/18, 11:47:01 PM",Pranathi," It's not fair that it's so hard right now, and I don't think it's totally off base to feel that way"
12952,"22/07/18, 11:47:11 PM",Pranathi, But you're right in saying that it probably won't make you feel any better
12953,"22/07/18, 11:47:23 PM",Sush, i'm starting to have like deja vu feeling like i never get anything without some despair first
12954,"22/07/18, 11:47:36 PM",Sush, i'm being so inarticulate first
12955,"22/07/18, 11:47:46 PM",Pranathi," It's okay, you don't need to be articulate and all"
12956,"22/07/18, 11:48:02 PM",Pranathi, Anger and frustration are totally legit feelings and I know they can rob you of your words
12957,"22/07/18, 11:48:27 PM",Sush, that boy was really so irritating
12958,"22/07/18, 11:48:31 PM",Sush, what are your DREAMS it seems
12959,"22/07/18, 11:48:32 PM",Sush, eff you
12960,"22/07/18, 11:48:36 PM",Pranathi," Yeah, that must have been so triggering"
12961,"22/07/18, 11:48:40 PM",Pranathi, Dreams is such a safed way of thinking
12962,"22/07/18, 11:48:48 PM",Sush, how dare you think you can be privy to my dreams you rando
12963,"22/07/18, 11:50:00 PM",Pranathi, Yeah. I think that's so entitled
12964,"22/07/18, 11:50:11 PM",Pranathi, To think we all do things because we're trying to chase some dumb fucking dream
12965,"22/07/18, 11:50:27 PM",Sush, and like why is that casual conversation lol
12966,"22/07/18, 11:50:32 PM",Sush, whatever happened to books and movies
12967,"22/07/18, 11:50:53 PM",Pranathi, Yeah lol. It seems like that's all very intense topics only
12968,"22/07/18, 11:51:04 PM",Pranathi, Just little bit chill and smoke a J or something people
12969,"22/07/18, 11:51:06 PM",Sush, who the eff is this guy lol

12972,"22/07/18, 11:51:33 PM",Sush, like KAUN HAI TU
12973,"22/07/18, 11:51:55 PM",Pranathi, Ew. You just block this fellow
12974,"22/07/18, 11:51:58 PM",Pranathi, Sounds like a bottomdweller
12975,"22/07/18, 11:52:02 PM",Sush, katherine was also so irritated
12976,"22/07/18, 11:52:56 PM",Pranathi, That's natural. He sounds like an asshol
12977,"22/07/18, 11:52:56 PM",Sush, sorry i'm ranting so much -_-
12978,"22/07/18, 11:52:58 PM",Pranathi, *asshole

12986,"22/07/18, 11:53:59 PM",Sush, and annoyance at chelsea's STUPID dog
12987,"22/07/18, 11:54:51 PM",Pranathi, Was the dog there lol?

12993,"22/07/18, 11:55:35 PM",Pranathi, Maybe it'll help with the anxiety over the job stuff
12994,"22/07/18, 11:55:46 PM",Sush, not really 
12995,"22/07/18, 11:55:49 PM",Sush, maybe i should

13025,"23/07/18, 12:00:02 AM",Pranathi, especially if it involves annoying entitled Mormon boys
13026,"23/07/18, 12:00:06 AM",Sush, i will do like that only ❤

13056,"23/07/18, 11:30:21 PM",Pranathi, It's just annoying because he's been very vague about all this
13057,"23/07/18, 11:30:34 PM",Pranathi, And now suddenly he's freaking about his deadline and realizes he didn't ask about map specifications before
13058,"23/07/18, 11:30:45 PM",Sush, Aaaah
13059,"23/07/18, 11:30:59 PM",Pranathi, Anyway. It'll get done! Don't want to worry too  much about work
13060,"23/07/18, 11:31:04 PM",Pranathi, That's a dangerous rabbit hole to go down
13061,"23/07/18, 11:31:06 PM",Sush, Yeah it’ll be fine!
13062,"23/07/18, 11:31:56 PM",Pranathi, what plans now?

13089,"23/07/18, 11:35:25 PM",Sush, How is grandmom?
13090,"23/07/18, 11:35:40 PM",Pranathi, She's fine. I think we bore each other a little bit unless we're talking about food.
13091,"23/07/18, 11:35:48 PM",Pranathi, I mean there's only so much we have to say to each other
13092,"23/07/18, 11:35:56 PM",Sush, omg my Paati’s sister makes her grand kids call her ‘grandma’ instead of Paati
13093,"23/07/18, 11:35:59 PM",Sush, Fair!
13094,"23/07/18, 11:36:00 PM",Pranathi, And I'm not sure she totally approves of me flouncing out of the house everyday
13095,"23/07/18, 11:36:03 PM",Sush, 😂
13096,"23/07/18, 11:36:08 PM",Sush, Probably not 😅
13097,"23/07/18, 11:36:08 PM",Pranathi, So Anglo hahaha
13098,"23/07/18, 11:36:14 PM",Sush, Ya it’s so weird lol
13099,"23/07/18, 11:36:25 PM",Sush, My Paati is sooooo judgy about it
13100,"23/07/18, 11:36:33 PM",Pranathi, Does she also watch Bold and the Beautiful like Nitya's grandmom?
13101,"23/07/18, 11:36:42 PM",Sush, Lolol no!
13102,"23/07/18, 11:36:48 PM",Pranathi," We were talking about soaps our paatis watch and she says, ""My grandmom watches the Bold and the Beautiful."""
13103,"23/07/18, 11:36:52 PM",Sush, But my sister and  I used to watch
13104,"23/07/18, 11:36:53 PM",Sush, Hahahaha
13105,"23/07/18, 11:36:57 PM",Pranathi, And we all just cracked up because of COURSE her grandmother would

13111,"[23/07/18, 11:41:45 PM",Sush, ‎image omitted
13112,"23/07/18, 11:51:54 PM",Pranathi, I'm just working right now
13113,"23/07/18, 11:52:08 PM",Pranathi," I have an interview with another Carnatic guy today who does ""innovative"" Carnatic music outreach"
13114,"23/07/18, 11:52:14 PM",Pranathi, Fusion stuff basically
13115,"23/07/18, 11:52:26 PM",Pranathi, I'm supposed to meet with a gaana singer but he's not really responding to texts
13116,"23/07/18, 11:52:45 PM",Pranathi, HAHA hilarious tweet
13117,"23/07/18, 11:53:09 PM",Sush, Ooh nice!
13118,"23/07/18, 11:53:18 PM",Sush, So annoys
13119,"23/07/18, 11:54:59 PM",Sush, Ayyo I thought my father was worrying about my job thing
13120,"23/07/18, 11:55:10 PM",Sush, So I preemptively texted him being like don’t worry
13121,"23/07/18, 11:55:20 PM",Sush, He was like wtf when did I say I’m worried
13122,"23/07/18, 11:55:33 PM",Sush, Which is relieving to hear
13123,"23/07/18, 11:55:44 PM",Sush, What did he say re
13124,"23/07/18, 11:56:59 PM",Pranathi, So nice that your dad is being chill about it!
13125,"23/07/18, 11:57:04 PM",Pranathi, It must be such a relief no?
13126,"23/07/18, 11:57:08 PM",Sush, Ya it isss
13127,"23/07/18, 11:57:11 PM",Pranathi, Haven't spoken to the guy yet
13128,"23/07/18, 11:57:15 PM",Pranathi, The interview is today
13129,"23/07/18, 11:57:27 PM",Sush, Ohh correct sorry time diff confuse
13130,"23/07/18, 11:57:38 PM",Pranathi, Lol yes
13131,"23/07/18, 11:57:52 PM",Pranathi, I am feeling so lethargic
13132,"23/07/18, 11:57:56 PM",Pranathi, This heat doesn't help
13133,"23/07/18, 11:58:03 PM",Sush, I can imagine 😭
13134,"23/07/18, 11:58:15 PM",Sush, Plus Home is also such a borrowing time
13135,"24/07/18, 12:01:10 AM",Pranathi, Yeahhh.
13136,"24/07/18, 12:01:27 AM",Pranathi, I'm really ready to just have my own apartment back and start working
13137,"24/07/18, 12:01:36 AM",Pranathi, I'm finding it soooo hard to work here
13138,"24/07/18, 12:01:50 AM",Sush, Yaaa people interrupt so much also 😅
13139,"24/07/18, 12:01:59 AM",Sush, and no quiet space
13140,"24/07/18, 12:03:22 AM",Pranathi, Yeah exactly
13141,"24/07/18, 12:03:35 AM",Pranathi, My grandmother keeps barging in and she starts talking even if I'm doing something else
13142,"24/07/18, 12:03:41 AM",Pranathi, And there's no way to get her to stop
13143,"24/07/18, 12:49:31 AM",Sush, It’ll be too much to postpone work till you return no? 
13144,"24/07/18, 1:06:55 AM",Pranathi, Yeah. 
13145,"24/07/18, 1:07:10 AM",Pranathi, This Nick thing from last year is really triggering me about coming back
13146,"24/07/18, 1:07:15 AM",Pranathi, I know rationally it's not the same
13147,"24/07/18, 1:07:24 AM",Pranathi, But I feel so much more depleted than I did a year ago
13148,"24/07/18, 1:07:26 AM",Sush, I can understand 
13149,"24/07/18, 1:07:44 AM",Pranathi, Just exhausted and cynical and sad and betrayed still
13150,"24/07/18, 1:07:48 AM",Sush, The last time must have been so traumatising
13151,"24/07/18, 1:07:54 AM",Pranathi, Which I thought would go away after a year
13152,"24/07/18, 1:08:06 AM",Pranathi," Yeah, the dread at leaving and returning"
13153,"24/07/18, 1:08:19 AM",Pranathi, Felt very much like I was stuck in the cracks of movement
13154,"24/07/18, 1:08:26 AM",Sush, It doesn’t get easier 
13155,"24/07/18, 1:08:59 AM",Pranathi, He keeps coming in my dreams after elaborate set ups where we finally meet. It feels like we're about to talk about what happened and then I wake up
13156,"24/07/18, 1:09:06 AM",Sush," There’s a lot to look forward to? New project is going nicely, there’s no huge trauma to deal with upon your return"
13157,"24/07/18, 1:09:12 AM",Sush, Oh man 
13158,"24/07/18, 1:09:20 AM",Pranathi, Yeah true. I think there's just a sense of lack of closure somehow
13159,"24/07/18, 1:09:32 AM",Pranathi, Maybe you never really get it
13160,"24/07/18, 1:09:35 AM",Sush, I can completely understand how triggering your impending return must be
13161,"24/07/18, 1:09:53 AM",Sush, Probably not 
13162,"24/07/18, 1:10:02 AM",Pranathi, Thank you for understanding. It also makes me sad that my mom is being so fucking unreasonable with this period stuff
13163,"24/07/18, 1:10:07 AM",Pranathi, Like she's gone berserk
13164,"24/07/18, 1:10:23 AM",Pranathi, And it really sucks. I hate that she would be so stubborn about this one thing of all things
13165,"24/07/18, 1:10:52 AM",Pranathi, She's been passive aggressively sending me blogs of women who say the kitchen being off limits thing is based on some pseudo Ayurveda crap
13166,"24/07/18, 1:11:00 AM",Sush, Oh man why is she digging her heels in for this 
13167,"24/07/18, 1:11:11 AM",Sush, Abbas this internet pseudo science
13168,"24/07/18, 1:11:16 AM",Sush, *abbah
13169,"24/07/18, 1:11:57 AM",Sush, My dad’s SURGEON friend sent him a video about how drink gaumutra once a week is great for health
13170,"24/07/18, 1:12:28 AM",Pranathi, I think she's being petulant because she doesn't see me resisting anything else this vehemently
13171,"24/07/18, 1:12:43 AM",Pranathi, For the most part I've just been nodding along
13172,"24/07/18, 1:12:56 AM",Sush, What does your dad say?
13173,"24/07/18, 1:12:58 AM",Pranathi, This one thing she thinks is because of my radical sociology training lol
13174,"24/07/18, 1:13:02 AM",Sush, 🤦🏽‍♀️
13175,"24/07/18, 1:13:05 AM",Pranathi, My dad hasn't said a word to me
13176,"24/07/18, 1:13:31 AM",Pranathi, But he's silently giving my mom his support while indicating to my BROTHER that he thinks it's stupid
13177,"24/07/18, 1:13:43 AM",Sush, Ugh I hate that
13178,"24/07/18, 1:13:50 AM",Pranathi, I talked to my brother and for once he's being fully onboard
13179,"24/07/18, 1:14:02 AM",Sush, Oh good
13180,"24/07/18, 1:14:02 AM",Pranathi, I told him he needs to stand up for me if he cares enough
13181,"24/07/18, 1:14:12 AM",Pranathi, Like that's he least he could do because it doesn't affect him AT AL
13182,"24/07/18, 1:14:14 AM",Pranathi, AL
13183,"24/07/18, 1:14:17 AM",Pranathi, ALL
13184,"24/07/18, 1:14:19 AM",Sush, True
13185,"24/07/18, 1:14:19 AM",Pranathi, lol
13186,"24/07/18, 1:14:25 AM",Pranathi, Which he did to his credit
13187,"24/07/18, 1:14:35 AM",Pranathi, And got yelled at apparently
13188,"24/07/18, 1:14:47 AM",Sush, Lol it’s ok he can get yelled at
13189,"24/07/18, 1:14:59 AM",Sush, Part of the negotiation
13190,"24/07/18, 1:14:59 AM",Pranathi, Anyway it's all messed up and my mom is being militant about this and I'm trying hard not to resent her
13191,"24/07/18, 1:15:08 AM",Pranathi, Yeah I don't really think he minded
13192,"24/07/18, 1:15:21 AM",Sush, Good that he’s rallying!
13193,"24/07/18, 1:15:23 AM",Pranathi, He's super shocked at my mom's treatment of me which infuriates me
13194,"24/07/18, 1:15:34 AM",Pranathi, It means he's never received any of this in his life
13195,"24/07/18, 1:15:40 AM",Sush, True he probably hasn’t
13196,"24/07/18, 1:15:49 AM",Pranathi, And that sort of privilege just enrages me. It's not his fault
13197,"24/07/18, 1:15:59 AM",Sush, True
13198,"24/07/18, 1:16:07 AM",Pranathi, But I'm just so angry that these battles aren't even his to fight
13199,"24/07/18, 1:16:31 AM",Pranathi, I think going away is probably good. My mom just feels like I'm too different from her and the rest of them for my own good
13200,"24/07/18, 1:16:47 AM",Pranathi, And she doesn't mind what I do unless I'm actually physically in this house
13201,"24/07/18, 1:16:56 AM",Pranathi, Which sucks because it means this house doesn't feel like home
13202,"24/07/18, 1:17:11 AM",Sush, True it isn’t fair to do that 
13203,"24/07/18, 1:17:29 AM",Pranathi," Anyway, sorry for going off and thank you for listening"
13204,"24/07/18, 1:17:42 AM",Sush, No no I would be infuriated too
13205,"24/07/18, 1:17:43 AM",Pranathi, I'm just at my wits' end with her because she chooses precisely the wrong battles to fight
13206,"24/07/18, 1:17:55 AM",Pranathi, I told her to stand up for herself more generally
13207,"24/07/18, 1:18:10 AM",Pranathi, And I meant with my thatha and household chores and the maids who keep bunking
13208,"24/07/18, 1:18:15 AM",Sush, 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️
13209,"24/07/18, 1:18:23 AM",Pranathi, But she's taken it to mean she has to stand up to me
13210,"24/07/18, 1:18:30 AM",Pranathi, Shot myself in the foot with this one lol
13211,"24/07/18, 1:18:37 AM",Sush, Lolol
13212,"24/07/18, 1:19:05 AM",Pranathi," Issok, I'm just trying to let the days roll by but it's hard to separate all this from how I interact with her otherwise"
13213,"24/07/18, 1:19:20 AM",Pranathi, Trying to separate the issues but I can't get past this somehow
13214,"[24/07/18, 1:26:02 AM",Pranathi, ‎image omitted
13215,"24/07/18, 7:16:38 AM",Pranathi, Are you yewake?
13216,"24/07/18, 7:18:58 AM",Sush, Hiii
13217,"24/07/18, 7:19:19 AM",Sush, There’s one stupid eee in my house and it woke me up 🤬
13218,"24/07/18, 7:19:35 AM",Sush, Sorry I fell asleep when we were talking!!
13219,"24/07/18, 7:19:34 AM",Pranathi, Hiiii I thought you might want to bitch about Vinay Sridhar's article in the Indian Express so I am offering up my services
13220,"24/07/18, 7:19:41 AM",Pranathi, Ugh eees hate them
13221,"24/07/18, 7:19:45 AM",Sush, Hahahaha I just saw it tooooo
13222,"24/07/18, 7:19:50 AM",Pranathi, Lol no worries I was anyway randomly whining
13223,"24/07/18, 7:20:13 AM",Pranathi," My only thought reading it was, aren't you one of these people tho?"
13224,"24/07/18, 7:20:38 AM",Sush, Ya little bit
13225,"24/07/18, 7:20:49 AM",Sush, He’s pretty well versed in like Karnataka politics tho
13226,"24/07/18, 7:21:28 AM",Sush, He’s so obsessed with Harvard 😅
13227,"24/07/18, 7:22:26 AM",Pranathi, He writes well too
13228,"24/07/18, 7:22:44 AM",Pranathi, Although the end with the whole female underprivileged Barack Obama crap was so trite
13229,"24/07/18, 7:22:49 AM",Sush, He does. I wanted to hate the article so much more 😭😭
13230,"24/07/18, 7:23:01 AM",Sush, Agree and it reinforces his complaint
13231,"24/07/18, 7:23:04 AM",Pranathi, It's like he undid the US as a point of comparison
13232,"24/07/18, 7:23:10 AM",Pranathi, Argument
13233,"24/07/18, 7:23:12 AM",Sush, Absolutely
13234,"24/07/18, 7:23:40 AM",Pranathi, I want to say that I hate Indians who exalt Barack Obama as the paragon of virtue in politics also
13235,"24/07/18, 7:23:47 AM",Sush, Yesssss
13236,"24/07/18, 7:24:11 AM",Pranathi, That whole Obama is a miracle man mentality is so white liberal
13237,"24/07/18, 7:24:25 AM",Sush, We have Dalit president now - says v v little about Dalits in India
13238,"24/07/18, 7:24:32 AM",Pranathi, He's a man who disowned his own community in many ways
13239,"24/07/18, 7:24:57 AM",Pranathi, Yeah exactly. It's not like his intersectionality draws from specifically Indian categories of inequality
13240,"24/07/18, 7:25:16 AM",Pranathi, And chumma you put one female Indian Obama statement and wowow so feminist ah
13241,"24/07/18, 7:25:18 AM",Sush, Obama is a loved black man like Kalam was a loved Muslim man
13242,"24/07/18, 7:25:41 AM",Sush, Loved for behaving white / upper caste Hindu
13243,"24/07/18, 7:25:47 AM",Sush, ‘Not like them’
13244,"24/07/18, 7:25:56 AM",Pranathi, Yeah exactly. Respectability politics
13245,"24/07/18, 7:26:07 AM",Pranathi, Good Muslim
13246,"24/07/18, 7:26:11 AM",Pranathi, Good black
13247,"24/07/18, 7:26:20 AM",Sush, hau!
13248,"24/07/18, 7:26:25 AM",Pranathi, But yeah the article overall was well written
13249,"24/07/18, 7:26:35 AM",Sush, Won’t stir shit up
13250,"24/07/18, 7:26:45 AM",Sush, yeah ugh lol
13251,"24/07/18, 7:27:02 AM",Sush, I wanted to retweet it but I didn’t because I’m petty
13252,"24/07/18, 7:27:11 AM",Pranathi, Haha I think that's valid
13253,"24/07/18, 7:27:15 AM",Pranathi, You don't owe it to him
13254,"24/07/18, 7:27:27 AM",Pranathi, I didn't ask for Sneha's article on Facebook because I'm petty 
13255,"24/07/18, 7:27:39 AM",Sush, I also didn’t ask 🤦🏽‍♀️
13256,"24/07/18, 7:27:52 AM",Sush, Mostly because I’d have to make up stuff about loving it
13257,"24/07/18, 7:27:53 AM",Pranathi, Lolol I just don't want to read it
13258,"24/07/18, 7:28:02 AM",Pranathi, Yeah exactlyyyy
13259,"24/07/18, 7:28:04 AM",Sush, (Or scarier - id love it)
13260,"24/07/18, 7:28:20 AM",Pranathi, And I have no energy to be gushy towards her
13261,"24/07/18, 7:28:35 AM",Pranathi, Mostly afraid I'll go down a rabbit hole of what am I doing with my life
13262,"24/07/18, 7:28:46 AM",Pranathi, And how did she get so many articles published in such a short life
13263,"24/07/18, 7:28:47 AM",Sush, Fair 😅
13264,"24/07/18, 7:28:57 AM",Sush, I have no excuse - I’m just being a bad friend
13265,"24/07/18, 7:29:33 AM",Pranathi," Lolol no man issok, I think you're allowed to not be cheering her on for every single thing she does"
13266,"24/07/18, 7:29:43 AM",Sush, true
13267,"24/07/18, 7:29:45 AM",Pranathi, With Sneha that would require lots of effort
13268,"24/07/18, 7:29:46 AM",Sush, Stupid Vinay
13269,"24/07/18, 7:29:53 AM",Pranathi, She does so many things
13270,"24/07/18, 7:30:01 AM",Pranathi, Ugh Vinay
13271,"24/07/18, 7:30:01 AM",Sush, She truly does 😅
13272,"24/07/18, 7:30:34 AM",Sush, His need to belong in this global educated elite is sooo transparent
13273,"24/07/18, 7:30:47 AM",Sush, and that desire is perfectly valid
13274,"24/07/18, 7:30:52 AM",Sush, but it bugs me 😅
13275,"24/07/18, 7:31:10 AM",Pranathi, Haha to be bugged by it is also valid
13276,"[24/07/18, 7:38:49 AM",Sush, ‎image omitted
13277,"24/07/18, 7:41:49 AM",Pranathi, Hahaha yessss
13278,"24/07/18, 7:47:03 AM",Sush, It’s so interesting that Modi’s having been a tea seller doesn’t get similar traction
13279,"24/07/18, 7:47:32 AM",Pranathi, Maybe he doesn't peddle that as much?
13280,"24/07/18, 7:47:39 AM",Sush, Obama went to _harvard_
13281,"24/07/18, 7:47:43 AM",Sush, Maybe
13282,"24/07/18, 7:47:52 AM",Sush, Which is also a curious choice
13283,"24/07/18, 7:54:20 AM",Pranathi," Yeah it is curious, very curious"
13284,"24/07/18, 8:40:17 AM",Pranathi, Hey so I have some bad news
13285,"24/07/18, 8:40:32 AM",Pranathi, Lakme stopped making the Scarlet Drill line 
13286,"[24/07/18, 8:41:01 AM",Pranathi, ‎image omitted
13287,"24/07/18, 10:38:45 AM",Sush, 😭😭😭😭😭
13288,"24/07/18, 10:38:52 AM",Sush, I hate Lakme!!!
13289,"24/07/18, 10:38:59 AM",Sush, They did this to apricot nectar also!
13290,"24/07/18, 10:39:18 AM",Sush, Which was my Favvv until they discontinued it
13291,"24/07/18, 10:40:22 AM",Sush, Don’t worry about a different colour I’ll find something here
13292,"24/07/18, 10:40:27 AM",Sush, Thank you for trying 😘
13293,"[24/07/18, 11:40:56 AM",Sush, ‎image omitted
13294,"24/07/18, 1:40:25 PM",Pranathi, Hahahaha
13295,"24/07/18, 1:40:27 PM",Pranathi, Omg so true
13296,"24/07/18, 1:40:38 PM",Pranathi, Btw I just saw Raazi!
13297,"24/07/18, 2:34:40 PM",Sush, ooh how was it?
13298,"24/07/18, 6:21:52 PM",Sush, Riddhima and I want to start lunch dabba service
13299,"24/07/18, 6:21:54 PM",Sush, 👻
13300,"24/07/18, 11:11:01 PM",Pranathi, Hi
13301,"24/07/18, 11:11:06 PM",Pranathi, Sorry! I just woke up
13302,"24/07/18, 11:11:10 PM",Pranathi, Still awake? 
13303,"24/07/18, 11:11:20 PM",Pranathi, Ooh lunch dabba service would be so nice
13304,"24/07/18, 11:11:27 PM",Pranathi, Dabbawalis!
13305,"24/07/18, 11:12:05 PM",Pranathi," Movie was decent. It was well made and engaging, but I'm not such a big fan of the country and patriotism above all else business"
13306,"24/07/18, 11:22:30 PM",Sush, Hiii
13307,"24/07/18, 11:22:58 PM",Sush, Agreee but I also wonder if it is privilege that allows us to have that stance
13308,"24/07/18, 11:25:23 PM",Pranathi, I'm not saying that she's at fault individually. I know joining the armed forces isn't really a matter of ideology for most people
13309,"24/07/18, 11:25:45 PM",Pranathi, But I don't know if privilege has everything to do with blaming the institutions that create pawns out of individuals
13310,"24/07/18, 11:25:58 PM",Pranathi, And taking a generally pacifist stance about war
13311,"24/07/18, 11:33:18 PM",Sush, True
13312,"24/07/18, 11:33:59 PM",Sush, I guess once you’re _in_ the army you need to believe that there’s a higher purpose to what you’re doing etc
13313,"24/07/18, 11:34:24 PM",Sush," South India also insulates us so much, no?"
13314,"24/07/18, 11:34:54 PM",Sush," It’s interesting how the absence of like, partition trauma in the family etc probably influences how we feel"
13315,"24/07/18, 11:36:03 PM",Pranathi," Yeah, I guess that's true"
13316,"24/07/18, 11:36:37 PM",Pranathi, I don't feel as strongly about Pakistan as someone who's probably witnessed trauma like partition
13317,"24/07/18, 11:36:45 PM",Sush, How was Alia?
13318,"24/07/18, 11:36:52 PM",Sush," Yeah, same"
13319,"24/07/18, 11:37:34 PM",Pranathi, Yeah she was really good
13320,"24/07/18, 11:37:39 PM",Pranathi, I think she's very talented
13321,"24/07/18, 11:37:55 PM",Sush, She’s so talented 😍
13322,"24/07/18, 11:38:00 PM",Sush, Where you saw?
13323,"24/07/18, 11:38:05 PM",Sush, It’s not on Netflix no?
13324,"24/07/18, 11:38:06 PM",Pranathi, At home
13325,"24/07/18, 11:38:10 PM",Sush, I also want to see
13326,"24/07/18, 11:38:11 PM",Pranathi, Amazon prime
13327,"24/07/18, 11:38:15 PM",Sush, Ohhh ok ok
13328,"24/07/18, 11:38:28 PM",Sush, Hey you want to watch Charulata when you return?
13329,"24/07/18, 11:38:36 PM",Pranathi, Sure!
13330,"24/07/18, 11:38:51 PM",Sush, We’ll do movie and pizza night!
13331,"24/07/18, 11:39:04 PM",Pranathi, That sounds so funnnn
13332,"24/07/18, 11:39:10 PM",Pranathi, Yessss 
13333,"24/07/18, 11:39:12 PM",Sush, I also want to watch one tam movie with Revati about women in the workplace
13334,"24/07/18, 11:39:21 PM",Sush, Trying to remember what it’s called
13335,"24/07/18, 11:39:43 PM",Sush, Magalir Mattum
13336,"24/07/18, 11:41:41 PM",Pranathi, Oh yeah let's watchhhhh
13337,"24/07/18, 11:44:17 PM",Sush, 👯👯
13338,"24/07/18, 11:44:27 PM",Sush, I slept off at 7 and woke up an hour ago
13339,"24/07/18, 11:44:33 PM",Sush, So wide awake and ugh
13340,"24/07/18, 11:48:24 PM",Pranathi, Haha I hear you. I was like that last night
13341,"25/07/18, 12:02:16 AM",Pranathi, I'm meeting Oviya for lunch tomorrow!
13342,"25/07/18, 12:14:42 AM",Sush, Niice!
13343,"25/07/18, 12:14:46 AM",Sush, Where are you two going
13344,"25/07/18, 12:14:53 AM",Pranathi, Anokhi!
13345,"25/07/18, 12:15:00 AM",Sush, Cuties😍
13346,"25/07/18, 12:15:16 AM",Sush, So FOMO haha
13347,"25/07/18, 12:16:10 AM",Pranathi, Haha and then dinner with your sister on Friday
13348,"25/07/18, 12:16:21 AM",Sush, ❤️❤️❤️
13349,"25/07/18, 12:16:22 AM",Pranathi, Sorry I feel like I am intensifying fomo
13350,"25/07/18, 12:16:29 AM",Sush, I’m VERY happy you’re meeting my sister
13351,"25/07/18, 12:16:38 AM",Pranathi, ❤❤❤ ME TOO.
13352,"25/07/18, 12:16:41 AM",Pranathi, She seems so kind and lovely!
13353,"25/07/18, 12:16:49 AM",Sush, You both are!
13354,"25/07/18, 12:17:02 AM",Pranathi, Aww
13355,"25/07/18, 12:17:05 AM",Pranathi, You also are
13356,"[25/07/18, 12:17:26 AM",Sush, ‎image omitted
13357,"25/07/18, 12:17:32 AM",Sush, I’m bored today
13358,"25/07/18, 12:17:43 AM",Pranathi, Haha hi selfie creature
13359,"25/07/18, 12:17:46 AM",Pranathi, 
13360,"25/07/18, 12:17:50 AM",Pranathi, You look cute!
13361,"25/07/18, 12:17:56 AM",Pranathi, I am meeting TM Krishna today
13362,"25/07/18, 12:18:00 AM",Pranathi, Give ideas for interview questions
13363,"25/07/18, 12:18:06 AM",Sush, Omg!!!
13364,"25/07/18, 12:18:08 AM",Pranathi, I don't want to ask him anything too obvious because of his temper
13365,"25/07/18, 12:18:20 AM",Sush, That is VERY exciting
13366,"25/07/18, 12:18:24 AM",Pranathi, But I also don't want to make him do my dissertation
13367,"25/07/18, 12:18:25 AM",Pranathi, So trying to strike the right balance
13368,"25/07/18, 12:18:34 AM",Pranathi, His PA still hasn't sent me the address though
13369,"25/07/18, 12:18:44 AM",Sush, Ohh I wonder where he lives lol
13370,"25/07/18, 12:18:53 AM",Sush, So curious to hear about his house also!
13371,"25/07/18, 12:19:46 AM",Pranathi, We're not meeting at his house
13372,"25/07/18, 12:19:51 AM",Pranathi, We're meeting somewhere in Mylapore
13373,"25/07/18, 12:19:56 AM",Pranathi, And that's all the information I've gotten so far
13374,"25/07/18, 12:19:57 AM",Pranathi, 
13375,"25/07/18, 12:20:04 AM",Pranathi, It's like meeting some top secret government dude
13376,"25/07/18, 12:20:10 AM",Sush, 😂
13377,"25/07/18, 12:20:16 AM",Sush, Big day today 👯👯
13378,"25/07/18, 12:22:48 AM",Pranathi, Yeah haha
13379,"25/07/18, 12:22:51 AM",Pranathi, I am excited!
13380,"25/07/18, 12:22:53 AM",Pranathi, I hope he doesn't cancel
13381,"25/07/18, 12:22:56 AM",Pranathi, I'll be very upset
13382,"25/07/18, 12:23:01 AM",Pranathi, But tell question ideas no!
13383,"25/07/18, 12:23:03 AM",Pranathi, I am nervous 
13384,"25/07/18, 12:30:14 AM",Sush, Thinking!
13385,"25/07/18, 12:30:47 AM",Pranathi," Hi! Sorry, I am helping mom with lunch"
13386,"25/07/18, 12:30:50 AM",Pranathi, I will call after?
13387,"25/07/18, 12:30:54 AM",Sush, No worriessss
13388,"25/07/18, 12:31:04 AM",Sush, No rush nothing important haha
13389,"25/07/18, 12:31:10 AM",Sush, Just called to talk about tmk
13390,"25/07/18, 12:58:26 AM",Pranathi, Hi!
13391,"25/07/18, 12:58:33 AM",Pranathi," Sorry, just finished"
13392,"25/07/18, 12:58:36 AM",Pranathi, Still up?
13393,"25/07/18, 1:05:01 AM",Sush, Hiii
13394,"25/07/18, 1:05:05 AM",Sush, Yes unfortunately
13395,"25/07/18, 1:05:12 AM",Sush, I am wide awake 🤬
13396,"25/07/18, 1:05:36 AM",Pranathi, Ughh bugging!
13397,"25/07/18, 1:05:42 AM",Pranathi, Is it hot in your apartment also?
13398,"25/07/18, 1:05:51 AM",Sush, It is but I have my new friend
13399,"25/07/18, 1:06:06 AM",Sush, My little AC robot
13400,"25/07/18, 1:07:40 AM",Pranathi, Oh this is true
13401,"25/07/18, 1:07:44 AM",Pranathi, Ac-shay?
13402,"25/07/18, 1:07:58 AM",Sush, Just AC-man
13403,"25/07/18, 1:08:13 AM",Sush, 🤖
13404,"25/07/18, 1:18:03 AM",Pranathi, Dude these gaana people keep canceling on me
13405,"25/07/18, 1:18:09 AM",Pranathi, And I really need them to engageeee
13406,"25/07/18, 1:20:40 AM",Sush, ayyo
13407,"25/07/18, 1:20:54 AM",Sush, do you think it feels like they're going out of their way to meet you?
13408,"25/07/18, 1:21:06 AM",Sush, like is there anything you can do to make it logistically easier
13409,"25/07/18, 1:21:10 AM",Sush, for them
13410,"25/07/18, 1:21:13 AM",Pranathi, I'm going to their area only
13411,"25/07/18, 1:21:25 AM",Pranathi, Like the guy I was supposed to meet today says he lives in Mylapore
13412,"25/07/18, 1:21:32 AM",Pranathi," And I said I'd go there, he can tell me the place and time"
13413,"25/07/18, 1:21:43 AM",Pranathi, He said 3 pm and he'd tell me where. But now he's not responding
13414,"25/07/18, 1:21:47 AM",Pranathi, I wonder if it's intimidating them
13415,"25/07/18, 1:21:56 AM",Sush, ayyo
13416,"25/07/18, 1:21:58 AM",Pranathi, When I say interview. I explained that it would be me just learning about their art form
13417,"25/07/18, 1:22:05 AM",Sush, ya i wonder what's happening
13418,"25/07/18, 1:22:09 AM",Pranathi," That I'd ask questions about how they started playing, where they play"
13419,"25/07/18, 1:22:19 AM",Pranathi, But I wonder if saying interview is scaring them off
13420,"25/07/18, 1:22:34 AM",Pranathi," Also this idea of committing to an ""appointment"" is hard I think. It's definitely a classed notion"
13421,"25/07/18, 1:22:40 AM",Pranathi, That you meet at 3 pm at a coffee shop
13422,"25/07/18, 1:22:45 AM",Sush, but i imagine your irb wouldn't  be ok to phrase it as something else?
13423,"25/07/18, 1:22:50 AM",Sush, ya so true!
13424,"25/07/18, 1:23:07 AM",Pranathi, It's not like I have IRB for this phase
13425,"25/07/18, 1:23:20 AM",Pranathi," So I can frame it however, but I feel weird saying anything but"
13426,"25/07/18, 1:23:26 AM",Sush, ohh okay okay
13427,"25/07/18, 1:23:30 AM",Sush, ya i hear you
13428,"25/07/18, 1:23:42 AM",Sush," esp to frame it as professional, not personal"
13429,"25/07/18, 1:23:42 AM",Pranathi," I could just say conversation, but I don't want them to mistake that as me coming onto them"
13430,"25/07/18, 1:23:53 AM",Sush, hau correct
13431,"25/07/18, 1:23:57 AM",Pranathi," Yeah, like let's get coffee and talk"
13432,"25/07/18, 1:24:01 AM",Pranathi, It's inviting trouble
13433,"25/07/18, 1:24:12 AM",Sush, it is it is
13434,"25/07/18, 1:24:20 AM",Sush, and this keeps what they say 'on the record'
13435,"25/07/18, 1:24:31 AM",Pranathi," Like they seem to want to talk to me, because this one guy keeps sending me his videos"
13436,"25/07/18, 1:24:35 AM",Pranathi, And sending good morning good night messages
13437,"25/07/18, 1:24:43 AM",Sush, lol those are so confuse
13438,"25/07/18, 1:24:46 AM",Pranathi, But maybe the idea of actually answering a bunch of questions one on one is intimidating
13439,"25/07/18, 1:24:48 AM",Sush, i used to get from my surveyors
13440,"25/07/18, 1:24:54 AM",Pranathi, Yeah?
13441,"25/07/18, 1:24:58 AM",Sush, soo many good morning flowers
13442,"25/07/18, 1:25:01 AM",Pranathi, I just don't respond when I get those
13443,"25/07/18, 1:25:06 AM",Pranathi, So maybe I've offended them also
13444,"25/07/18, 1:25:25 AM",Sush, maybe once in a while you can say 'beautiful messages' or something
13445,"25/07/18, 1:25:54 AM",Pranathi, Lolol
13446,"25/07/18, 1:25:56 AM",Pranathi, Good point
13447,"25/07/18, 1:26:11 AM",Pranathi, It's hard to strike this balance of being professional but also not appearing cold
13448,"25/07/18, 1:26:19 AM",Sush, but i also doubt those messages are meant to elicit replies
13449,"25/07/18, 1:27:12 AM",Pranathi, That's true. I'm not sure if I'm doing something wrong in the general rules of conduct though
13450,"25/07/18, 1:30:28 AM",Sush, you think sneha might have any insights?
13451,"25/07/18, 1:30:33 AM",Sush, maybe oves will tomorrow
13452,"25/07/18, 1:39:19 AM",Pranathi, Yeah I'll talk to Oviya tomorrow
13453,"25/07/18, 1:41:52 AM",Pranathi," We had this cat that kept coming around the house, and it had a litter of three kittens. We found out that some stray dogs snatched up two of the kittens last night and it's really sad. This cat's so disconsolate it breaks my heart. We saw the mom cat fight off the two dogs but they overpowered her. It's really so sad"
13454,"25/07/18, 1:46:51 AM",Pranathi," Actually I'm realizing it's not just these guys. Even some of the band guys I wanted to interview (F-16s, Non-violinists), they've also been flakes. I wonder how much of it is just the whole being a musician thing."
13455,"25/07/18, 1:47:06 AM",Pranathi," Like they're hustling pretty hard and I have nothing to offer them in return, so it's probably easier to flake?"
13456,"25/07/18, 1:47:45 AM",Sush, oh my gosh!!!
13457,"25/07/18, 1:47:51 AM",Sush, freaking dogs
13458,"25/07/18, 1:48:02 AM",Pranathi," Yeah, we saw the video on the security camera"
13459,"25/07/18, 1:48:09 AM",Pranathi, The mom cat was so scared paavam!
13460,"25/07/18, 1:48:13 AM",Sush, possibly!
13461,"25/07/18, 1:48:17 AM",Sush, paapa!!!!
13462,"25/07/18, 1:49:10 AM",Pranathi, Sorry for going on about the musicians. It's probably annoying to hear my thought process right now lol
13463,"25/07/18, 1:50:38 AM",Sush, pfft no not at all!
13464,"25/07/18, 1:50:48 AM",Sush, this is a significant thing you're undertaking!
13465,"25/07/18, 1:51:07 AM",Pranathi, ❤ Thank youuuuu
13466,"25/07/18, 1:51:15 AM",Pranathi, So okay I finally got the address
13467,"25/07/18, 1:51:19 AM",Pranathi, So this is happening
13468,"25/07/18, 1:51:20 AM",Pranathi, Yassss
13469,"25/07/18, 1:51:22 AM",Sush, oooooh!!
13470,"25/07/18, 1:51:24 AM",Pranathi, I think I'm going to his house
13471,"25/07/18, 1:51:27 AM",Sush, what are you wearing!
13472,"25/07/18, 1:51:27 AM",Pranathi, TMK I mean
13473,"25/07/18, 1:51:31 AM",Pranathi, LOL
13474,"25/07/18, 1:51:33 AM",Sush, sorry lol
13475,"25/07/18, 1:51:39 AM",Pranathi, Probably kurta and leggings
13476,"25/07/18, 1:51:40 AM",Pranathi, Hahaha

13527,"25/07/18, 10:42:04 PM",Sush, These rad movies don’t age thaaaat well no??
13528,"25/07/18, 10:42:25 PM",Sush," Although this wasn’t bad, all things considered"
13529,"25/07/18, 10:42:26 PM",Pranathi, Yeah I tried to watch it again a few years ago and it was so boring! No offense
13530,"25/07/18, 10:42:45 PM",Sush, Ya like a lot of the humour is like errr awks
13531,"25/07/18, 10:42:46 PM",Pranathi, I just thought it went on for too long with parts that had no immediate relevance to the plot
13532,"25/07/18, 10:43:00 PM",Sush, True
13533,"25/07/18, 10:43:01 PM",Pranathi, lol yeah like some of it's just dated and there's no salvaging it
13534,"25/07/18, 10:43:08 PM",Sush, Ya lol
13535,"[25/07/18, 10:43:17 PM",Pranathi, ‎image omitted

13540,"25/07/18, 10:43:41 PM",Sush, I used to like saif a lot
13541,"25/07/18, 10:43:46 PM",Sush, But he’s also asshole IRL
13542,"25/07/18, 10:44:03 PM",Sush, he denies evolution lol
13543,"25/07/18, 10:44:10 PM",Pranathi, Hahaha means?
13544,"25/07/18, 10:44:14 PM",Pranathi, Why you dislike him?
13545,"25/07/18, 10:44:19 PM",Sush, and mocks people speaking up about nepotism
13546,"25/07/18, 10:44:35 PM",Sush, He and his dad got v upset at the suggestion that they evolved from monkeys
13547,"25/07/18, 10:44:44 PM",Sush, His dad was like maybe y’all but not Muslims
13548,"25/07/18, 10:44:45 PM",Sush, 😅
13549,"25/07/18, 10:44:59 PM",Pranathi, Looool you can't have touchy celebs man
13550,"25/07/18, 10:45:05 PM",Pranathi, They need to work on being thick skinned
13551,"25/07/18, 10:45:15 PM",Sush, Saif said some shit about Kangana speaking up against nepotism also
13552,"25/07/18, 10:45:25 PM",Pranathi, Sure it sucks but that's an occupational hazard
13553,"25/07/18, 10:45:29 PM",Sush, But he’s still Kareena’s husband 😍
13554,"25/07/18, 10:45:33 PM",Pranathi, I love Kangana
13555,"25/07/18, 10:45:39 PM",Pranathi, She's so smart
13556,"25/07/18, 10:45:45 PM",Pranathi, And unpretentious
13557,"25/07/18, 10:45:45 PM",Sush, She is
13558,"25/07/18, 10:45:59 PM",Sush, She played that Hrithik Roshan thing v weirdly tho
13559,"25/07/18, 10:46:06 PM",Pranathi, What was that?
13560,"25/07/18, 10:46:26 PM",Sush, She went on and on and on about how they had an affair and he broke up with her
13561,"25/07/18, 10:46:44 PM",Sush, While he didn’t acknowledge anything and was like wtf are you talking about
13562,"25/07/18, 10:47:04 PM",Pranathi, Weeeeird
13563,"25/07/18, 10:47:11 PM",Pranathi, Do you think she was lying?
13564,"25/07/18, 10:47:34 PM",Sush, Who knows 
13565,"25/07/18, 10:47:43 PM",Sush, He seems like an asshole so idk
13566,"25/07/18, 10:48:09 PM",Sush, But it was like why you’re washing dirty laundry in public when the other person won’t acknowledge
13567,"25/07/18, 10:48:22 PM",Sush, and it wasn’t assault or anything
13568,"25/07/18, 10:48:51 PM",Sush, But it probably suuuuuucks to be in that place
13569,"25/07/18, 10:49:03 PM",Pranathi, Yeah for sure
13570,"25/07/18, 10:49:10 PM",Pranathi, I guess eventually you get cynical and lack
13571,"25/07/18, 10:49:12 PM",Pranathi, Pack
13572,"25/07/18, 10:49:14 PM",Sush, Paapa
13573,"25/07/18, 10:49:16 PM",Sush, Maybe
13574,"25/07/18, 10:49:30 PM",Pranathi, But in the beginning it must suck to not have anyone take you seriously or to feel like no one will believe you
13575,"25/07/18, 10:49:37 PM",Sush, Yeah!!
13576,"25/07/18, 10:50:14 PM",Sush, And all these people closed ranks after she called them out on Koffee with Karan
13577,"25/07/18, 10:50:37 PM",Sush, Horrid fellows
13578,"25/07/18, 11:04:18 PM",Sush, can i tell you something????
13579,"25/07/18, 11:04:21 PM",Sush, it is absurd
13580,"25/07/18, 11:04:22 PM",Sush, but
13581,"25/07/18, 11:04:24 PM",Sush, it is there
13582,"25/07/18, 11:04:27 PM",Sush, inside my mind
13583,"25/07/18, 11:04:29 PM",Sush, so i'll say
13584,"25/07/18, 11:04:54 PM",Sush, i am worried about mercury retrograde
13585,"25/07/18, 11:08:01 PM",Pranathi, Ohhh why are you worried about mercury retrograde?
13586,"25/07/18, 11:08:26 PM",Sush, it is bad for scorpio career and finances it seems!
13587,"25/07/18, 11:08:44 PM",Sush, like either of those could get ANY WORSE
13588,"25/07/18, 11:09:04 PM",Sush, ofc my horoscope also said i'll FIND love last nov
13589,"25/07/18, 11:10:33 PM",Pranathi, Yeah exactly haha
13590,"25/07/18, 11:10:47 PM",Pranathi, It tells me I'm supposed to have found someone a year ago
13591,"25/07/18, 11:11:02 PM",Pranathi, Don't take it too seriously
13592,"25/07/18, 11:11:07 PM",Sush, trooooo
13593,"25/07/18, 11:11:09 PM",Pranathi, It's like WebMD with me
13594,"25/07/18, 11:11:12 PM",Pranathi, Potent crap
13595,"25/07/18, 11:11:14 PM",Sush, correct
13596,"25/07/18, 11:11:31 PM",Pranathi, It's not a sign and a different website will probably tell you the opposite
13597,"25/07/18, 11:11:41 PM",Pranathi, But the worry is real and I understand the anxiety 💕
13598,"25/07/18, 11:11:56 PM",Pranathi, It's probably just projection though! Don't read too much into it
13599,"25/07/18, 11:12:28 PM",Sush, you're right
13600,"25/07/18, 11:16:05 PM",Pranathi, Sorry if I'm not being helpful
13601,"25/07/18, 11:16:31 PM",Sush, no no it is such an irrational anxiety 
13602,"25/07/18, 11:16:49 PM",Sush, my sister's eloquent response was
13603,"25/07/18, 11:16:50 PM",Sush, 'aye nonsense'
13604,"25/07/18, 11:18:52 PM",Pranathi, Lolol

13658,"26/07/18, 6:59:37 AM",Sush, Ohhh how was thstttt
13659,"26/07/18, 6:59:40 AM",Pranathi, I definitely felt like I was blabbering and being too vulnerable
13660,"26/07/18, 6:59:51 AM",Pranathi, But otherwise it was really nice
13661,"26/07/18, 7:00:01 AM",Pranathi, I feel like she thinks I'm mad
13662,"26/07/18, 7:00:09 AM",Pranathi, But I've always been slightly terrified of her
13663,"26/07/18, 7:00:30 AM",Sush, Hahaha no that’s how she sees everyone 😂 she likes you and would’ve appreciated the vulnerability!
13664,"26/07/18, 7:00:37 AM",Pranathi, Hahaha okay good

13667,"26/07/18, 7:01:01 AM",Pranathi, I was just unabashedly myself and was silently praying that I wasn't repulsing her
13668,"26/07/18, 7:01:04 AM",Pranathi, Lolol
13669,"26/07/18, 7:01:10 AM",Pranathi, We talked about grad school a lot

13671,"26/07/18, 7:01:27 AM",Pranathi, She also agreed that he was being crazy
13672,"26/07/18, 7:01:36 AM",Pranathi, So I was like whew so it's not just me

13680,"26/07/18, 7:03:05 AM",Pranathi, What happened with Sneha?
13681,"26/07/18, 7:03:08 AM",Sush, Ohhh v interesting I didn’t know she knew them
13682,"26/07/18, 7:03:27 AM",Sush, She posted on her stories saying she cried because she’s tired of men talking down to her
13683,"26/07/18, 7:03:31 AM",Pranathi, Me neither lol. I was impressed she's maintained contact.
13684,"26/07/18, 7:03:46 AM",Pranathi, But I think they're all Solly students

13692,"26/07/18, 7:57:42 AM",Pranathi, She mentioned you a little when I brought you up
13693,"26/07/18, 7:57:58 AM",Pranathi, But for the most part she wasn't talking all that much
13694,"26/07/18, 7:58:21 AM",Pranathi, I felt like l was extorting responses a little
13695,"26/07/18, 7:58:33 AM",Pranathi, But maybe I was just self conscious about talking too much
13696,"26/07/18, 8:44:50 AM",Sush, Lol sounds like Ovi

13778,"26/07/18, 12:43:17 PM",Sush, The other people he’s interviewing sound like hardcore spatial peeps 
13779,"26/07/18, 12:43:35 PM",Sush, I want to go beyond ‘I bring ENTHU and CHARM and a WILLINGNESS to learn ‘ ugh
13780,"26/07/18, 12:43:50 PM",Pranathi, Don't despair already

13784,"26/07/18, 12:44:22 PM",Pranathi, And he's not dumb enough to think only spatial people can learn things etc
13785,"26/07/18, 12:44:34 PM",Pranathi, I'm sure if this is meant to be you'll get it! 💕

13829,"26/07/18, 12:49:51 PM",Pranathi, It teaches equality of all religions
13830,"26/07/18, 12:50:00 PM",Pranathi, And equality of all people
13831,"26/07/18, 12:51:05 PM",Pranathi," And there's no real traditions or anything, just faith"
13832,"26/07/18, 12:52:36 PM",Pranathi, But obb it's got usual problems of any religion that becomes institutionalized
13833,"26/07/18, 12:57:42 PM",Sush, So nice!!
13834,"26/07/18, 12:57:51 PM",Sush, What a lovely lovely place

13847,"26/07/18, 2:08:40 PM",Sush, Yaaa
13848,"26/07/18, 2:08:52 PM",Sush, It felt wrong to pass up on such a good deal 👻
13849,"26/07/18, 2:09:00 PM",Pranathi, Correct.
13850,"26/07/18, 2:09:00 PM",Sush, You are still awakeeee

13853,"26/07/18, 2:09:10 PM",Sush, Paapa
13854,"26/07/18, 2:09:12 PM",Pranathi, Just randomly moping about things
13855,"26/07/18, 2:09:26 PM",Sush, Ugh lollapalooza is here yak
13856,"26/07/18, 2:09:36 PM",Sush, Kya hua ?
13857,"26/07/18, 2:10:26 PM",Pranathi, Haha oh yeah
13858,"26/07/18, 2:10:37 PM",Pranathi, I hope I can get home okay. I arrive the day before it starts
13859,"26/07/18, 2:10:46 PM",Pranathi, I once came the day it started and it took me three hours
13860,"26/07/18, 2:10:58 PM",Sush, Ugh that sucks
13861,"26/07/18, 2:11:01 PM",Pranathi, Nothing happened! Just feeling broody
13862,"26/07/18, 2:11:07 PM",Sush, You should be ok the day before hopefully
13863,"26/07/18, 2:11:12 PM",Sush, What day do you arrive?
13864,"26/07/18, 2:11:18 PM",Pranathi, Wednesday morning
13865,"26/07/18, 2:11:24 PM",Sush, The night can do that no? 
13866,"26/07/18, 2:11:30 PM",Pranathi, I think I'll take train till Jackson
13867,"26/07/18, 2:11:39 PM",Pranathi, Yeahhhh something about night time
13868,"26/07/18, 2:11:42 PM",Sush, Haan you’ll beat the worst of it then
13869,"26/07/18, 2:11:44 PM",Pranathi, I've been having such weird dreams also
13870,"26/07/18, 2:11:57 PM",Sush, Oh man I’m sorry those are so disconcerting
13871,"26/07/18, 2:12:07 PM",Pranathi, Yeahhh the Nick dream sort of messed me up
13872,"26/07/18, 2:12:20 PM",Pranathi, I wish I could just ask him to get a cup of coffee with me to talk about some things
13873,"26/07/18, 2:12:44 PM",Pranathi, But I know he'll ignore and I don't want to be in the position of asking or being rejected
13874,"26/07/18, 2:12:47 PM",Sush, Will it help to articulate what you want from him?
13875,"26/07/18, 2:13:02 PM",Sush," Like, to me or to yourself - not him"
13876,"26/07/18, 2:13:37 PM",Pranathi," I don't know. I think I just want some answers to stuff that I don't know. Like how did that happen with Lauren, how long had they been texting"
13877,"26/07/18, 2:13:47 PM",Pranathi, I don't know if it would make me feel better
13878,"26/07/18, 2:13:58 PM",Pranathi, But it would make a year and a half ago me feel vindicated
13879,"26/07/18, 2:14:01 PM",Pranathi, Like I wasn't crazy
13880,"26/07/18, 2:14:13 PM",Sush, True - you’re definitely not crazy
13881,"26/07/18, 2:14:30 PM",Sush, Whether it was two weeks or ten you were right to be suspicious
13882,"26/07/18, 2:14:40 PM",Pranathi, And I think I want an apology. Like an honest to god apology just saying there were no excuses to be made
13883,"26/07/18, 2:14:45 PM",Pranathi, It wasn't about my weight
13884,"26/07/18, 2:15:16 PM",Pranathi," All that stuff he said, I want him to really feel like shit for ever letting me feel that way after being sneaky about this"
13885,"26/07/18, 2:15:38 PM",Pranathi," But I think this is all just about me, not about him"
13886,"26/07/18, 2:15:41 PM",Sush, God knows you deserve that
13887,"26/07/18, 2:15:58 PM",Sush, But I wouldn’t hold my breath to hear an apology from him though 
13888,"26/07/18, 2:16:01 PM",Pranathi, Both him and Suraj. Neither has apologized to me
13889,"26/07/18, 2:16:09 PM",Sush, It sounds like he’s rationalised it to himself somehow
13890,"26/07/18, 2:16:13 PM",Pranathi, And I think I feel really sore about it
13891,"26/07/18, 2:16:20 PM",Pranathi, Like didn't I even deserve that much
13892,"26/07/18, 2:16:26 PM",Sush, And clearly the fact that he can’t even face you is proof of his cowardice
13893,"26/07/18, 2:16:31 PM",Sush, You really do 
13894,"26/07/18, 2:17:04 PM",Sush, I feel like calling him and saying you asshole you owe her an apology
13895,"26/07/18, 2:17:07 PM",Pranathi, It makes me feel so sad to think how naive I was. Like I want to hug earlier me and also give one proper tight slap
13896,"26/07/18, 2:17:15 PM",Pranathi, Awwwww that is so so kind
13897,"26/07/18, 2:17:22 PM",Pranathi, Just the sentiment means a lot to me
13898,"26/07/18, 2:17:26 PM",Pranathi, 💕💕
13899,"26/07/18, 2:17:31 PM",Sush, Better to be naive that cynical and closed off ❤️
13900,"26/07/18, 2:17:44 PM",Sush, I will HAPPILY do it if you say the word
13901,"26/07/18, 2:17:48 PM",Pranathi, Yeah but I think I've gotten cynical and closed off
13902,"26/07/18, 2:18:08 PM",Pranathi, And I blame both of them for behaving in ways that make me trust men so little
13903,"26/07/18, 2:18:13 PM",Sush, You’ve also not met anyone worth buying into
13904,"26/07/18, 2:18:40 PM",Pranathi," I would ask you to, but also I know he'd be an asshole to you and I couldn't bear to have that happen"
13905,"26/07/18, 2:18:49 PM",Pranathi, He'd probably hang up
13906,"26/07/18, 2:19:17 PM",Pranathi," Or if he was Suraj, he'd call me and yell at me for disturbing his domestic bliss"
13907,"26/07/18, 2:19:22 PM",Sush, Hanging up is the worst he can do to me! He barely knows he he has no power to hurt my feelings
13908,"26/07/18, 2:19:30 PM",Sush, Lol I can’t believe Suraj did that
13909,"26/07/18, 2:19:51 PM",Pranathi, Lol yeah. He did that after he heard from Manasa that I bitched about Samvita
13910,"26/07/18, 2:19:57 PM",Pranathi, And asked me to stop spreading slander lolol
13911,"26/07/18, 2:20:02 PM",Sush, Ugh
13912,"26/07/18, 2:20:06 PM",Pranathi," Asked no, yelled"
13913,"26/07/18, 2:20:09 PM",Sush, Suraj is such a WEAK person
13914,"26/07/18, 2:20:24 PM",Pranathi," Yeah, but I think if I get an apology from him, I want it to be from his own remorse"
13915,"26/07/18, 2:20:34 PM",Pranathi, I think he knows what he's done is shit but will never admit to it
13916,"26/07/18, 2:20:34 PM",Sush, Entirely fair
13917,"26/07/18, 2:20:39 PM",Sush, True
13918,"26/07/18, 2:20:45 PM",Pranathi," It's not like he has to realize, he knows and he just can't own up to it"
13919,"26/07/18, 2:20:54 PM",Pranathi," Because like Suraj, he is also weak"
13920,"26/07/18, 2:20:59 PM",Sush, And he’s rolling around in $ to convince himself he’s fine
13921,"26/07/18, 2:21:04 PM",Pranathi," I dated two cowards, yuck"
13922,"26/07/18, 2:21:07 PM",Sush, Yak
13923,"26/07/18, 2:21:18 PM",Sush, Statistically overwhelmingly likely tho
13924,"26/07/18, 2:21:25 PM",Pranathi, Yeah I saw his new girlfriend's profile picture because I have a death wish
13925,"26/07/18, 2:21:28 PM",Sush, Given that you date men
13926,"26/07/18, 2:21:32 PM",Pranathi, And she is in golf clothes
13927,"26/07/18, 2:21:38 PM",Pranathi, Lolol sadly too true
13928,"26/07/18, 2:21:42 PM",Pranathi, Golf clothes ughhh
13929,"26/07/18, 2:21:54 PM",Pranathi, Only rich people unironically wear golf clothes
13930,"26/07/18, 2:21:59 PM",Sush, Lolol true
13931,"26/07/18, 2:22:06 PM",Pranathi, And he must love that whole glitzy life
13932,"26/07/18, 2:22:17 PM",Pranathi, He even told me how her dad owns some hotel in the Gold Coast
13933,"26/07/18, 2:22:30 PM",Pranathi, It gives me acid to think of the two of them together
13934,"26/07/18, 2:22:38 PM",Sush, So lame they sound
13935,"26/07/18, 2:22:38 PM",Pranathi, Sorry I am going off about this
13936,"26/07/18, 2:22:43 PM",Sush, How can we reduce acid?
13937,"26/07/18, 2:22:49 PM",Pranathi, I just haven't thought about it in a while and that dream made me feel baaaaf
13938,"26/07/18, 2:22:51 PM",Pranathi, Baaaad
13939,"26/07/18, 2:23:02 PM",Sush, Ultimately acid erodes us only. How shall we neutralise?
13940,"26/07/18, 2:23:09 PM",Pranathi, Be basic?
13941,"26/07/18, 2:23:13 PM",Pranathi, See what I did there?
13942,"26/07/18, 2:23:14 PM",Sush, 😂😘
13943,"26/07/18, 2:23:29 PM",Sush, this is why we are friends
13944,"26/07/18, 2:23:40 PM",Sush, because I’ll laugh at all this
13945,"26/07/18, 2:23:45 PM",Pranathi," Lol issok, I think I should interpret that dream as me coming to grips with never having that closure and still being able to do cult level magic"
13946,"26/07/18, 2:23:54 PM",Pranathi, Awww that is true friendship 😘😍
13947,"26/07/18, 2:24:01 PM",Sush, You are a magical person!

13951,"26/07/18, 2:24:33 PM",Pranathi, Puns flying everywhere
13952,"26/07/18, 2:24:36 PM",Sush, Nick has noooo room in your life as it stands
13953,"26/07/18, 2:24:50 PM",Sush, Like I’m searching for crevice to stick him in and I can’t find
13954,"26/07/18, 2:25:11 PM",Pranathi, True. My life wouldn't be half as exciting as it is if he were still around
13955,"26/07/18, 2:25:31 PM",Sush, Ya he was holding you back and we don’t need that
13956,"26/07/18, 2:25:34 PM",Pranathi," But there are times when I miss feeling wanted like that, and even then I know it has less to do with him"
13957,"26/07/18, 2:25:43 PM",Sush, Entirely fair and valid
13958,"26/07/18, 2:26:00 PM",Sush, To miss being in a romantic relationship
13959,"26/07/18, 2:26:11 PM",Sush, No need to be single fun chill cool girl eff that

13962,"26/07/18, 2:26:32 PM",Pranathi, And this is the sad truth
13963,"26/07/18, 2:26:37 PM",Pranathi, 🤦‍♀😭

14204,"29/07/18, 9:49:02 AM",Sush, Except you have to get there in a bus that’s hauled up by a rope

14370,"30/07/18, 12:14:50 AM",Pranathi, It just blocks all systems
14371,"30/07/18, 12:15:07 AM",Pranathi, Sitting there doing nothing except being a nuisance

14385,"30/07/18, 5:58:36 AM",Pranathi, 😘
14386,"[30/07/18, 6:49:19 AM",Pranathi, ‎image omitted
14387,"30/07/18, 7:52:57 AM",Sush, So trueee
14388,"30/07/18, 7:54:04 AM",Sush, Are you all packed?
14389,"30/07/18, 7:54:11 AM",Pranathi, Noooo I'm working lol
14390,"30/07/18, 7:54:46 AM",Pranathi, I have to pack. I haven't bought a lot of things I wanted to buy also
14391,"30/07/18, 7:54:53 AM",Pranathi," Whatever, it's not like I can't get there I guess!"
14392,"30/07/18, 7:55:01 AM",Pranathi, When did you end up sleeping?
14393,"30/07/18, 7:55:11 AM",Sush, True - like what?
14394,"30/07/18, 7:55:25 AM",Sush, Like 2
14395,"30/07/18, 7:55:38 AM",Sush, also I think my NW won’t work out 
14396,"30/07/18, 7:55:49 AM",Sush, He said he’ll keep digging with HR and get back to me
14397,"30/07/18, 7:56:01 AM",Sush, But it sounds like bad news
14398,"30/07/18, 7:56:04 AM",Pranathi, I wanted to get some spices and all
14399,"30/07/18, 7:56:10 AM",Pranathi," But issok, Metro is there"
14400,"30/07/18, 7:56:18 AM",Sush, Fair. Soooo much cheaper
14401,"30/07/18, 7:56:33 AM",Pranathi," Ugh, I'm sorry to hear that. "
14402,"30/07/18, 7:56:38 AM",Sush, I’m feeling slightly bitter about it
14403,"30/07/18, 7:56:50 AM",Pranathi," Yeah, as you should. The Visa thing is such BULLSHIT"
14404,"30/07/18, 7:56:57 AM",Pranathi, I can't believe that's a consideration over fit and expertise
14405,"30/07/18, 7:57:19 AM",Sush, I probably made a huge mistake turning down a stable offer that came months ago
14406,"30/07/18, 7:57:35 AM",Sush, I’m paying for my arrogance or whatever now
14407,"30/07/18, 7:58:03 AM",Pranathi," No, it just feels that way now because you haven't struck gold yet. But I'll remind you that you were *very* happy after you turned them down and you said you'd have been miserable if you'd worked for them"
14408,"30/07/18, 7:58:29 AM",Sush, that is true but if I’d known I’d have no other options
14409,"30/07/18, 7:58:45 AM",Sush, Way less misery than unemployment or returning to India and spending 15 years in debt
14410,"30/07/18, 7:59:03 AM",Sush, I’m feeling v defeated
14411,"30/07/18, 7:59:05 AM",Pranathi, We don't know that that's the only option left!
14412,"30/07/18, 7:59:13 AM",Pranathi, I definitely think it's more of the waiting game
14413,"30/07/18, 7:59:14 AM",Sush, like all I know how to do is be the right man for a job
14414,"30/07/18, 7:59:19 AM",Pranathi, But I can tooootaally understand
14415,"30/07/18, 7:59:25 AM",Sush, If that’s not enough idk how to navigate this
14416,"30/07/18, 7:59:35 AM",Pranathi, It must feel so so so harrowing to deal with this uncertainty
14417,"30/07/18, 8:00:14 AM",Pranathi, There is a job for you! You still have time left. I know this sounds like platitudes
14418,"30/07/18, 8:00:22 AM",Pranathi, But I truly truly truly believe that something good will come along
14419,"30/07/18, 8:00:52 AM",Pranathi, I am praying to ummachi everyday
14420,"30/07/18, 8:01:02 AM",Pranathi, Sushmita kku nala velai thedi kudu!
14421,"30/07/18, 8:01:13 AM",Pranathi, He's on the scout!
14422,"30/07/18, 8:01:22 AM",Pranathi," She, more likely"
14423,"30/07/18, 8:22:05 AM",Sush, Ugh it’s very annoying to go through this
14424,"30/07/18, 8:22:13 AM",Sush, Are you free for 5 mins
14425,"30/07/18, 8:22:25 AM",Pranathi, Yes!
14426,"30/07/18, 8:22:26 AM",Pranathi, CAll
14427,"30/07/18, 9:23:57 AM",Pranathi, How are you doing! Hourly check in
14428,"30/07/18, 12:56:03 PM",Sush, hii
14429,"30/07/18, 12:56:05 PM",Sush, meh
14430,"30/07/18, 1:03:07 PM",Pranathi, What are you doing?
14431,"30/07/18, 1:05:20 PM",Sush, nothing i'm home only
14432,"30/07/18, 1:05:31 PM",Sush, my sister told my parents
14433,"30/07/18, 1:05:36 PM",Sush, which im v annoyed at
14434,"30/07/18, 1:05:51 PM",Sush, she was like i was worried at how upset you were and i didnt want them bothering you
14435,"30/07/18, 1:05:54 PM",Sush, then stfu no
14436,"30/07/18, 1:05:55 PM",Pranathi, That is annoying
14437,"30/07/18, 1:06:03 PM",Pranathi, It's a breach in privacy
14438,"30/07/18, 1:06:09 PM",Sush, and then she was really sorry and contrite and i had to tell her it is ok
14439,"30/07/18, 1:06:17 PM",Pranathi, That sucks 
14440,"30/07/18, 1:06:28 PM",Sush, i know she'll be kicking herself also
14441,"30/07/18, 1:06:33 PM",Pranathi," I'm sorry, dealing with that on top of everything must be so sad"
14442,"30/07/18, 1:06:37 PM",Pranathi, Yeah for sure
14443,"30/07/18, 1:06:46 PM",Pranathi, I'm putting myself in her shoes and I know I'd be gutted
14444,"30/07/18, 1:06:51 PM",Pranathi, This way or that
14445,"30/07/18, 1:07:04 PM",Sush, she's like if you stop confiding in me i'll be destroyed
14446,"30/07/18, 1:07:20 PM",Sush, it's so hard to put aside your annoyance to tell someone it's ok
14447,"30/07/18, 1:08:07 PM",Pranathi, Yeah for sure. That's not the moment to do the emotion work of consoling someone who has annoyed you
14448,"30/07/18, 1:08:27 PM",Sush, yeah 
14449,"30/07/18, 1:08:35 PM",Pranathi, Aww
14450,"30/07/18, 1:08:42 PM",Sush, which made me so mad and chetana lol
14451,"30/07/18, 1:09:04 PM",Sush, how do you just stonewall someone who has apologized to you
14452,"30/07/18, 1:09:11 PM",Pranathi," She seems very understanding and lovely, but it's okay to be temporarily annoyed at someone you love."
14453,"30/07/18, 1:09:20 PM",Pranathi, Temporarily being the operative word
14454,"30/07/18, 1:09:21 PM",Sush, *at chetana
14455,"30/07/18, 1:09:34 PM",Sush, ya i told her i'm not mad i'm just irritated i have to deal with it
14456,"30/07/18, 1:09:43 PM",Pranathi, Fucking Chetana
14457,"30/07/18, 1:09:51 PM",Pranathi, She's a blight
14458,"30/07/18, 1:09:59 PM",Pranathi, No offense
14459,"30/07/18, 1:10:07 PM",Sush, correct only
14460,"30/07/18, 1:10:14 PM",Pranathi, I mean also offense
14461,"30/07/18, 1:10:24 PM",Pranathi, I don't feel particularly sorry
14462,"30/07/18, 1:10:38 PM",Pranathi," But yeah, what she did was not okay"
14463,"30/07/18, 1:10:56 PM",Sush, hahaha true
14464,"30/07/18, 1:10:58 PM",Sush, at all
14465,"30/07/18, 1:10:59 PM",Pranathi, How are you dealing with all this paapa?
14466,"30/07/18, 1:11:15 PM",Pranathi," Paruppu sadham for homesickness, anxiety and annoyance?"
14467,"30/07/18, 1:11:19 PM",Sush, i'm feeling very distraught today
14468,"30/07/18, 1:11:26 PM",Pranathi, I would insist you come eat at my place if I were there
14469,"30/07/18, 1:11:35 PM",Sush, i ate leftover chole which had too much onion -_-
14470,"30/07/18, 1:11:47 PM",Pranathi, Gassy?
14471,"30/07/18, 1:12:00 PM",Sush, rodrigo was like come sit with me and read your book
14472,"30/07/18, 1:12:14 PM",Sush, he is thesis-ing
14473,"30/07/18, 1:12:26 PM",Pranathi," Ooh, does that sound appealing?"
14474,"30/07/18, 1:12:28 PM",Sush, which i might do
14475,"30/07/18, 1:12:43 PM",Sush, but showering and walking there is not appealing lol
14476,"30/07/18, 1:13:08 PM",Pranathi, It'll probably make you feel way better once you do it
14477,"30/07/18, 1:13:14 PM",Pranathi, But I fully understand the inertia
14478,"30/07/18, 1:13:28 PM",Pranathi, Where is he? Crerar?
14479,"30/07/18, 1:13:28 PM",Sush, true it defs will

14484,"30/07/18, 1:13:54 PM",Sush, part of me wants to go to jimmy's -_-
14485,"30/07/18, 1:14:01 PM",Pranathi, If you stop by my place you can take picnic blanket also
14486,"30/07/18, 1:14:03 PM",Sush, i'm going to the lake this evening

14552,"30/07/18, 1:29:31 PM",Pranathi, Like it's kind of messed up and all. But to find that much reserve in self to be so gushingly in love
14553,"30/07/18, 1:29:40 PM",Pranathi, It seems impossible to do

14603,"30/07/18, 1:37:08 PM",Pranathi, Just for knowing sake
14604,"30/07/18, 1:37:12 PM",Sush, i am also very skeptical

14646,"30/07/18, 9:48:07 PM",Sush, Ya he didn’t say anything about what my sister said

14660,"30/07/18, 9:52:32 PM",Pranathi," She sent one text saying ""want to take dinner duty on Thursday?"""
14661,"30/07/18, 9:52:41 PM",Sush, lol whaaat
14662,"30/07/18, 9:52:48 PM",Pranathi, This is her way of asking I will cook her dinner on Thursday
14663,"30/07/18, 9:52:52 PM",Pranathi, Without even a please
14664,"30/07/18, 9:52:57 PM",Pranathi, Like wtf

14667,"30/07/18, 9:53:02 PM",Pranathi, Am I a total doormat
14668,"30/07/18, 9:53:15 PM",Sush, And as if you won’t do it if she asks nicely and you’re available
14669,"30/07/18, 9:53:28 PM",Pranathi," She'll say that about her hair also. Hey Pran, lll let you braid my hair if you want!"
14670,"30/07/18, 9:53:35 PM",Pranathi, Lolol whaaaaat
14671,"30/07/18, 9:53:37 PM",Sush, 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️
14672,"30/07/18, 9:53:39 PM",Sush, Wtf
14673,"30/07/18, 9:53:49 PM",Pranathi, It's just all so entitled
14674,"30/07/18, 9:53:59 PM",Pranathi," And I don't mean to whine, of course I'll do it"
14675,"30/07/18, 9:54:05 PM",Pranathi, But it's just basic courtesy!
14676,"30/07/18, 9:54:09 PM",Sush, It is!
14677,"30/07/18, 9:54:13 PM",Pranathi, To ask someone nicely and use the magic words
14678,"30/07/18, 9:54:21 PM",Sush, You would have happily said yes if she had asked nicely
14679,"30/07/18, 9:54:40 PM",Pranathi," Yeah, I said yes but I might have to reconsider if I'm too jet lagged"
14680,"30/07/18, 9:54:44 PM",Pranathi, Which is also petty of me
14681,"30/07/18, 9:54:58 PM",Sush, 😂 no she deserved that at least
14682,"30/07/18, 9:55:04 PM",Pranathi, But I don't want her to get the idea that I'm some doormat also. Already I know she sees people like that
14683,"30/07/18, 9:55:10 PM",Pranathi," Like how to use, how to get things"
14684,"30/07/18, 9:55:17 PM",Pranathi, I don't want to be collateral in that process
14685,"30/07/18, 9:55:27 PM",Pranathi, Sorry had to confess 🙈
14686,"30/07/18, 9:55:33 PM",Pranathi, I was feeling petty af
14687,"30/07/18, 9:55:44 PM",Sush, No it sounds fair to me
14688,"30/07/18, 9:55:48 PM",Sush, I’d be ticked off too
14689,"30/07/18, 9:56:06 PM",Pranathi, Yeah for sure
14690,"30/07/18, 9:56:23 PM",Pranathi, Ugh lol how white women are like this
14691,"30/07/18, 9:56:33 PM",Sush, Seriousleeee
14692,"30/07/18, 9:56:41 PM",Pranathi, Even my mom had these women in her PTA in LA who would do things like this
14693,"30/07/18, 9:56:54 PM",Sush, Sounds a bit like my cousin Sowmithri also
14694,"30/07/18, 9:57:00 PM",Pranathi," ""Gayathri, you can bring the salad for the next lunch meeting!"""
14695,"30/07/18, 9:57:05 PM",Pranathi, Yeah? How so?
14696,"30/07/18, 9:57:19 PM",Sush, Lolll bah
14697,"30/07/18, 9:57:30 PM",Sush," Her friends would braid her hair, iron her clothes"
14698,"30/07/18, 9:57:37 PM",Sush, I’m like HOW
14699,"30/07/18, 9:57:49 PM",Sush, Ovi talks like I do that 
14700,"30/07/18, 9:58:00 PM",Sush, Do I?
14701,"30/07/18, 9:58:14 PM",Sush, You can be honest - I won’t feel bad and I can be better then
14702,"30/07/18, 9:58:17 PM",Pranathi, lol I have never ironed your clothes or braided your hair
14703,"30/07/18, 9:58:23 PM",Pranathi, Not have you asked me to
14704,"30/07/18, 9:58:31 PM",Pranathi, So I don't know what she's talking about
14705,"30/07/18, 9:58:42 PM",Pranathi, What does she mean by that? How do you do that?
14706,"30/07/18, 9:58:47 PM",Sush, I don’t know 
14707,"30/07/18, 9:58:56 PM",Sush, She says I’m sli all the time
14708,"30/07/18, 9:59:07 PM",Pranathi, Wow really?
14709,"30/07/18, 9:59:14 PM",Pranathi, Like in what context?
14710,"30/07/18, 9:59:15 PM",Sush, ya idk
14711,"30/07/18, 9:59:23 PM",Pranathi, That seems like a rude thing to say to your friend
14712,"30/07/18, 9:59:27 PM",Sush, Sometimes I’m not even sure she likes me 😅
14713,"30/07/18, 9:59:29 PM",Pranathi, And if you have a problem say directly
14714,"30/07/18, 9:59:38 PM",Pranathi, Don't be passive aggressive and mean
14715,"30/07/18, 9:59:46 PM",Pranathi," While pretending to be a ""friend"""
14716,"30/07/18, 10:00:10 PM",Sush, Maybe she just doesn’t like me idk!
14717,"30/07/18, 10:00:19 PM",Pranathi, Especially in insinuating something mean about someone's character!
14718,"30/07/18, 10:01:27 PM",Sush, I hope I haven’t been saying stuff like that
14719,"30/07/18, 10:01:41 PM",Sush, Are you all packed? I’m sooo happy you’re coming back
14720,"30/07/18, 10:05:09 PM",Pranathi, Nah I think you're very self reflexive
14721,"30/07/18, 10:05:18 PM",Pranathi, And you never mean harm with friends
14722,"30/07/18, 10:05:23 PM",Pranathi, I wouldn't say you're malicious
14723,"30/07/18, 10:05:43 PM",Pranathi, Plus you're so good at saying thank you and making your friends feel appreciated
14724,"30/07/18, 10:05:47 PM",Pranathi, That's why you have so many!
14725,"30/07/18, 10:05:55 PM",Pranathi, Noooo I have to pack now

14736,"30/07/18, 11:15:19 PM",Pranathi, So your prescription basically involves a hundred shampoo bottles lol
14737,"30/07/18, 11:15:29 PM",Pranathi, I've taken them out of the boxes and put them all in a ziplock
14738,"30/07/18, 11:15:41 PM",Pranathi, And I've kept the boxes flattened to save space
14739,"30/07/18, 11:15:46 PM",Pranathi, Hope that's okay

14742,"30/07/18, 11:17:31 PM",Pranathi, It's okay! The shampoos just came individually in cardboard boxes so I had to remove them to make some space!
14743,"30/07/18, 11:17:51 PM",Sush, omg that sounds so annoying I’m sorry!
14744,"30/07/18, 11:17:55 PM",Sush, There were 100?!
14745,"30/07/18, 11:18:06 PM",Pranathi, No no not actually a hundred sorry haha
14746,"30/07/18, 11:18:22 PM",Pranathi, But like 10 or so dabbas
14747,"30/07/18, 11:18:38 PM",Pranathi, Which were taking up about two plastic bags full
14748,"30/07/18, 11:18:46 PM",Sush, You can leave the dabbas! Maybe just keep 1 for instructions
14749,"30/07/18, 11:18:54 PM",Pranathi, Yeah that's what I did
14750,"30/07/18, 11:19:04 PM",Pranathi, I removed them from dabbas and flattened out one of each box
14751,"30/07/18, 11:19:09 PM",Pranathi, Put it all in a giant ziplock
14752,"30/07/18, 11:19:12 PM",Sush, Oh man! I’m so sorry I imagined 1 shampoo bottle and 1 tube of lotion 🤦🏽‍♀️

15957,"29/08/18, 11:21:24 PM",Pranathi, Dude so scary!
15958,"29/08/18, 11:21:28 PM",Pranathi, Was it an accident?
15959,"29/08/18, 11:21:34 PM",Pranathi, Or a fight broke out?
15960,"29/08/18, 11:25:13 PM",Sush, i think a fight maybe
15961,"29/08/18, 11:25:19 PM",Sush, there were some 5 police cars
15962,"29/08/18, 11:25:24 PM",Sush, and general shouting
15963,"29/08/18, 11:27:29 PM",Pranathi, Man
15964,"29/08/18, 11:27:33 PM",Pranathi, You got home okay though?

15970,"29/08/18, 11:29:22 PM",Pranathi, ♥️
15971,"30/08/18, 1:16:53 AM",Sush, I have pissed off Didige again
15972,"30/08/18, 1:16:56 AM",Sush, Like idk

15977,"30/08/18, 1:20:58 AM",Sush, Like....?
15978,"30/08/18, 2:09:18 AM",Pranathi, Whoa! That escalated quickly
15979,"30/08/18, 2:09:31 AM",Pranathi, I don't get why the anger?
15980,"30/08/18, 2:09:49 AM",Sush, Right?!
15981,"30/08/18, 2:09:52 AM",Pranathi, Maybe it's one of those tone things
15982,"30/08/18, 2:10:02 AM",Pranathi, Like she misunderstood what you were saying because of text
15983,"[30/08/18, 2:10:07 AM",Sush, ‎image omitted
15984,"30/08/18, 2:10:07 AM",Pranathi, And then overreacted maybe?
15985,"30/08/18, 2:10:29 AM",Pranathi, Ugh that's horrible though
15986,"30/08/18, 2:10:31 AM",Sush, again I’m apologising lol
15987,"30/08/18, 2:10:40 AM",Pranathi, Hmmmm
15988,"30/08/18, 2:10:47 AM",Pranathi, You shouldn't have to apologize tho
15989,"30/08/18, 2:10:54 AM",Pranathi, I don't think you were being rude or anything
15990,"30/08/18, 2:11:04 AM",Sush, ya and like so much aggression
15991,"30/08/18, 2:10:59 AM",Pranathi, Or not letting her share her opinion
15992,"30/08/18, 2:11:08 AM",Sush, I was like peace out
15993,"30/08/18, 2:11:10 AM",Pranathi, Yeah that's a lot a lot
15994,"30/08/18, 2:11:22 AM",Pranathi, Maybe she's taking something else out on you
15995,"30/08/18, 2:11:40 AM",Sush, ‘I will not tolerate this’ is hearing my opinion
15996,"30/08/18, 2:11:44 AM",Pranathi," Like needing you to be a lot of things because of loneliness, new place etc. etc"
15997,"30/08/18, 2:11:50 AM",Sush, but me saying eh peace out is not hearing her opinion
15998,"30/08/18, 2:11:56 AM",Pranathi, And then getting frustrated when you obviously can't be her everything
15999,"30/08/18, 2:12:10 AM",Sush, ya idk how to be there for her rn
16000,"30/08/18, 2:12:24 AM",Sush, She is struggling to let me in and resenting me for not pushing harder
16001,"30/08/18, 2:12:41 AM",Sush, I am struggling to push also
16002,"30/08/18, 2:12:51 AM",Pranathi," I think she's crafted the perfect reaction and needs you to match it, but you never will"
16003,"30/08/18, 2:13:07 AM",Sush, because I have been rejected by jobs boyfriends best friends literally everything this past year
16004,"30/08/18, 2:13:41 AM",Sush, I know this is a huge transition for her
16005,"30/08/18, 2:13:48 AM",Pranathi, Yeah. Maybe you should tell her all this? I feel like she's maybe pushing you to be real with her
16006,"30/08/18, 2:13:55 AM",Pranathi, Even if it results in some yelling matches
16007,"30/08/18, 2:13:57 AM",Sush, Maybe I should just be more patient or something
16008,"30/08/18, 2:14:06 AM",Sush, ya maybe
16009,"30/08/18, 2:14:16 AM",Pranathi," I dunno obviously, all conjecture here"
16010,"30/08/18, 2:14:17 AM",Sush, I think she felt bad I didn’t tell her about SF etc
16011,"30/08/18, 2:14:28 AM",Sush, I told her just now
16012,"30/08/18, 2:14:48 AM",Pranathi, I don't think you have to feel as though you owe anyone every little detail
16013,"30/08/18, 2:15:02 AM",Pranathi, It's a slippery slope to codependency and hurt feelings from there on out
16014,"30/08/18, 2:15:06 AM",Sush, like she felt bad I didn’t each out when I was obviously struggling
16015,"30/08/18, 2:15:13 AM",Sush, *reach
16016,"30/08/18, 2:15:26 AM",Pranathi, But I can also see how she's flailing and probably feels like you're both unable to connect
16017,"30/08/18, 2:15:32 AM",Sush, idk anything anymore 🤦🏽‍♀️
16018,"30/08/18, 2:15:39 AM",Sush, Ya we are struggling to connect
16019,"30/08/18, 2:15:55 AM",Pranathi, Don't question the whole relationship and all. I think it's just a matter of talking about it
16020,"30/08/18, 2:16:06 AM",Pranathi, Just because some relationships have failed doesn't mean they'll all fail
16021,"30/08/18, 2:16:07 AM",Sush, True
16022,"30/08/18, 2:16:27 AM",Sush, Did you suddenly wake up paapa?
16023,"30/08/18, 2:16:41 AM",Pranathi, Each person is so complex and each person in your life will invariably end up having different paths in their relationship with you
16024,"30/08/18, 2:16:49 AM",Pranathi, They won't all just leave
16025,"30/08/18, 2:16:50 AM",Sush, Yeah 😭
16026,"30/08/18, 2:16:55 AM",Sush, I hope so
16027,"30/08/18, 2:16:55 AM",Pranathi, Nope lol
16028,"30/08/18, 2:16:59 AM",Pranathi, I have been crying
16029,"30/08/18, 2:17:02 AM",Pranathi, And feeling sorry for self
16030,"30/08/18, 2:17:10 AM",Sush," Oh no! Why, love?"
16031,"30/08/18, 2:17:16 AM",Sush, Movie was triggering? 
16032,"30/08/18, 2:17:16 AM",Pranathi, It's Nick's birthday today
16033,"30/08/18, 2:17:23 AM",Sush, Ohhh
16034,"30/08/18, 2:17:31 AM",Sush, When you guys spoke last?
16035,"30/08/18, 2:17:39 AM",Pranathi, And I realized this day last year was the last time we spoke
16036,"30/08/18, 2:17:42 AM",Pranathi, Yeah
16037,"30/08/18, 2:17:53 AM",Sush, Ayy I’m sorry 
16038,"30/08/18, 2:17:59 AM",Sush, It really sucks how that went down
16039,"30/08/18, 2:18:00 AM",Pranathi, And I'm like sitting here marking time in how many days it's been since we last spoke
16040,"30/08/18, 2:18:26 AM",Pranathi," And he's probably thinking, oh I started a relationship with this woman I'm in bed with a year ago"
16041,"30/08/18, 2:18:53 AM",Sush, He’s probably just thinking about his own dick face 
16042,"30/08/18, 2:19:04 AM",Pranathi, It's funny how we each have our own personal calendars marking anniversaries of trauma and joy
16043,"30/08/18, 2:19:12 AM",Sush, yeahhh
16044,"30/08/18, 2:19:23 AM",Pranathi, I think it just sucks because I think he really did love me
16045,"30/08/18, 2:19:25 AM",Sush, makes calendar years seem so arbitrary
16046,"30/08/18, 2:19:30 AM",Pranathi, And I think I really did love him
16047,"30/08/18, 2:19:38 AM",Sush, it does suck a lot 
16048,"30/08/18, 2:19:52 AM",Sush, and it’s totally understandable and valid to feel sad about it
16049,"30/08/18, 2:19:57 AM",Pranathi," We almost moved in, we talked about getting married and all"
16050,"30/08/18, 2:20:00 AM",Pranathi, Like wtf
16051,"30/08/18, 2:20:13 AM",Sush, incredible how that can just...change
16052,"30/08/18, 2:20:15 AM",Pranathi, You don't just do that and then dump someone on their sorry ass
16053,"30/08/18, 2:20:25 AM",Pranathi, Yeah
16054,"30/08/18, 2:20:51 AM",Pranathi," Sorry, there isn't much to say, I know. That's why I didn't text because there isn't much to say"
16055,"30/08/18, 2:20:57 AM",Pranathi, It's the same thing all over again
16056,"30/08/18, 2:21:06 AM",Pranathi, And I'm just bummed I'm still thinking about it a year later
16057,"30/08/18, 2:21:12 AM",Sush," No no, I can 100% understand!"
16058,"30/08/18, 2:21:32 AM",Sush," It feels annoying also, on top of feeling sad, no?"
16059,"30/08/18, 2:21:48 AM",Sush, Like ugh FEELING I have felt you so often and for so long why can’t you just leave
16060,"30/08/18, 2:22:06 AM",Pranathi," And tomorrow is the jazz festival, where I met that dumbass Andrew. Which wasn't even close to being the same thing, but I was so NAIVE to try and do it again with that fuckwad"
16061,"30/08/18, 2:22:27 AM",Sush, that was probably a coping mechanism no?
16062,"30/08/18, 2:22:31 AM",Pranathi, And Andrew was the last time I felt invested in any sort of romantic relationship
16063,"30/08/18, 2:22:33 AM",Sush, chew toying
16064,"30/08/18, 2:22:40 AM",Pranathi, Like a whole goddamn year ago now
16065,"30/08/18, 2:22:56 AM",Sush, find a boy less painful than nick to fixate on?
16066,"30/08/18, 2:23:04 AM",Pranathi, Yeah you're right
16067,"30/08/18, 2:23:18 AM",Pranathi, Although Andrew ended up tearing that wound open
16068,"30/08/18, 2:23:23 AM",Sush, It was probably sooo many nick feelings being projected onto him
16069,"30/08/18, 2:23:40 AM",Sush, and a different dude being the subject of it feels like moving on from nick also
16070,"30/08/18, 2:23:41 AM",Pranathi, Ghosting me like a total twat
16071,"30/08/18, 2:23:49 AM",Pranathi, Yeah true
16072,"30/08/18, 2:24:03 AM",Sush, what an immature little gnat
16073,"30/08/18, 2:24:06 AM",Pranathi, We both were projecting a bunch of shit onto each other
16074,"30/08/18, 2:24:18 AM",Pranathi," Anyway, Nick is the real annoyance"
16075,"30/08/18, 2:24:24 AM",Pranathi, I wish he'd really just go away
16076,"30/08/18, 2:24:39 AM",Pranathi, I was thinking about how like in March last year
16077,"30/08/18, 2:24:46 AM",Pranathi, He said he was going to move to Minneapolis
16078,"30/08/18, 2:24:52 AM",Pranathi, For some job he got
16079,"30/08/18, 2:25:00 AM",Pranathi, And then he asked if I could go with him
16080,"30/08/18, 2:25:10 AM",Sush, oh man
16081,"30/08/18, 2:25:15 AM",Pranathi," I said I couldn't quit PhD and just leave, especially since I'd get deported"
16082,"30/08/18, 2:25:32 AM",Pranathi," And then he asked what if we got married, since he'd been thinking about it forever anyway"
16083,"30/08/18, 2:25:36 AM",Pranathi, WTF
16084,"30/08/18, 2:25:44 AM",Sush, whoaaaa
16085,"30/08/18, 2:25:45 AM",Pranathi, While he was texting that woman
16086,"30/08/18, 2:26:07 AM",Pranathi," Yeah. So when he said that, and he was going to meet my parents and all, I got way ahead of myself"
16087,"30/08/18, 2:26:23 AM",Pranathi, And clearly thought he was in a totally different place than he actually was
16088,"30/08/18, 2:26:47 AM",Sush, he gave you every reason to think so
16089,"30/08/18, 2:26:49 AM",Pranathi," It just really sucks to remember it all over again. Like really, really sucks."
16090,"30/08/18, 2:26:56 AM",Pranathi, I'm in such a different place
16091,"30/08/18, 2:27:00 AM",Sush, I can imagine 
16092,"30/08/18, 2:27:12 AM",Pranathi, Texting some random boys on Tinder who I have no intention of actually seeing ever
16093,"30/08/18, 2:27:28 AM",Pranathi, And it feels worse off than all of that I had with Nick by far
16094,"30/08/18, 2:27:50 AM",Sush, Online dating sucks so much 
16095,"30/08/18, 2:27:54 AM",Pranathi," I know that's not true, because we had plenty of messed up shit, but it feels this way when I have my rose tinted retrospecs on"
16096,"30/08/18, 2:28:09 AM",Sush, modern society hasn’t figured out a way to match up its single young people
16097,"30/08/18, 2:28:14 AM",Pranathi, Retrospecs haha I just came up with that
16098,"30/08/18, 2:28:20 AM",Sush, 😂
16099,"30/08/18, 2:28:29 AM",Pranathi," Yeah, it really sucks"
16100,"30/08/18, 2:28:44 AM",Pranathi, I feel like a dumbass being on the apps
16101,"30/08/18, 2:28:58 AM",Pranathi, Anyway! That was my rant lol
16102,"30/08/18, 2:29:06 AM",Sush, I mean it’s entertainment sometimes why not I guess
16103,"30/08/18, 2:29:07 AM",Pranathi, There's nothing to do but to wait it out as always
16104,"30/08/18, 2:29:13 AM",Pranathi, It hasn't been this bad in a long time.
16105,"30/08/18, 2:29:27 AM",Pranathi, But I had that crushing feeling on my chest that I get sometimes when I'm really sad
16106,"30/08/18, 2:29:41 AM",Sush, Movie + birthday must have been triggering 
16107,"30/08/18, 2:29:45 AM",Pranathi, Like it hurts to breathe and move my ribcage
16108,"30/08/18, 2:29:53 AM",Sush, oh babe ❤️
16109,"30/08/18, 2:29:57 AM",Pranathi, Eww yeah and that too some trashy movie lol
16110,"30/08/18, 2:30:17 AM",Sush, i know that feeling. They do say heartbreak physically manifests as pain
16111,"30/08/18, 2:30:37 AM",Pranathi, Why am I still hurting though! It's been a year
16112,"30/08/18, 2:30:44 AM",Pranathi, I should be over it by now
16113,"30/08/18, 2:30:50 AM",Pranathi, I can bet he hasn't thought of me in forever
16114,"30/08/18, 2:30:54 AM",Sush, because you thought it was going to be forever
16115,"30/08/18, 2:30:59 AM",Sush, I’m sure he has
16116,"30/08/18, 2:31:17 AM",Pranathi, Yeah I did 
16117,"30/08/18, 2:31:27 AM",Pranathi, I'm actually such a mess
16118,"30/08/18, 2:31:52 AM",Pranathi," Anyway, it'll be okay"

16123,"30/08/18, 2:40:30 PM",Pranathi, Hi! You think Joanna would be interested in jazz fest?
16124,"30/08/18, 3:14:41 PM",Sush, Ooh I’ll ask
16125,"30/08/18, 3:15:08 PM",Pranathi, Yay!
16126,"30/08/18, 3:15:14 PM",Pranathi, Yeah I'd like to hang with her again!
16127,"30/08/18, 3:21:42 PM",Pranathi, OH WAIT
16128,"30/08/18, 3:21:44 PM",Pranathi, I actually just realized
16129,"30/08/18, 3:22:22 PM",Pranathi, I realized that there was this event at Thalia hall I wanted to go to today https
16130,"30/08/18, 3:22:24 PM",Pranathi, I think I pointed it out to you also
16131,"30/08/18, 3:22:29 PM",Pranathi, It's this round robin of musicians I love
16132,"30/08/18, 3:23:00 PM",Pranathi," I really want to go this instead, especially since Kurt elling's a vocalist and I'm not like a huuuuge fan"
16133,"30/08/18, 3:23:06 PM",Pranathi, But it's also not free
16134,"30/08/18, 3:23:44 PM",Pranathi, I get it if you don't want to spend money on some tix for randos! Although obviously I always would love if you did ❤
16135,"30/08/18, 3:24:30 PM",Pranathi, I'm sorry for being a spaz
16136,"30/08/18, 4:42:06 PM",Sush, hiii

16141,"30/08/18, 4:43:25 PM",Pranathi, Tickets are like 8ish bucks each if we book online
16142,"30/08/18, 5:51:51 PM",Pranathi, Done with the shower?
16143,"30/08/18, 6:34:54 PM",Pranathi," Hey, should I book online?"

16504,"04/09/18, 9:21:35 PM",Pranathi, That's the kind of male friendship I want
16505,"04/09/18, 9:21:42 PM",Sush, 🤣
16506,"04/09/18, 9:57:54 PM",Sush," sorry, i didn't mean to snap"
16507,"04/09/18, 9:59:51 PM",Sush," i think i bristled slightly earlier when you said it was sad to say that i felt like having put on weight was 'depressing' - like  i know it isn't ideal, but i guess it is kinda how it is for me as things stand atm"
16508,"04/09/18, 9:59:58 PM",Sush, i was misplacing that
16509,"04/09/18, 10:00:24 PM",Sush, i should've just brought it up like a grown-up than hold on to that stress
16510,"04/09/18, 10:05:15 PM",Pranathi," I know you're stressed, and I empathize and can only imagine. You're under a lot of pressure. It's just that I'm at a loss for words sometimes when you talk about it. I feel like I'm endlessly saying things that aren't going to land well. I feel like I'm hurting you by saying something that in my head sounds innocuous. I don't mean you any harm and I didn't mean to make you upset by saying any of that."
16511,"04/09/18, 10:07:45 PM",Pranathi, I didn't think that the sadness comment would strike such a nerve because I guess I didn't realize it was actually a problem you're still contending with. I'm sorry if it came across wrong when I said I'm sad. What I think I meant to say is that I care.
16512,"04/09/18, 10:11:52 PM",Sush," No, I know you don't intend any harm whatsoever! I'm not doing the best job of handling this whole time of my life also - it's scary and isolating - I'm spending so much energy trying not freak out, I end up reacting to innocuous things and that's not fair to you. I know you feel at a loss for words also - I guess I just feel the need to say it out loud and just have someone hear me say it. I don't feel like I can talk to my parents about it because they'll ask three million questions."
16513,"04/09/18, 10:15:25 PM",Sush," I know what you mean. I was feeling silly to bring it up because I knew your intentions were good, that it struck a nerve is more reflective of my lifelong insecurities about weight than anything else."
16514,"04/09/18, 10:20:55 PM",Pranathi," I hear you and want you to know that I understand it's scary and isolating. But you'll have to tell me what I can say to let you know I'm listening and I care. Right now, I feel like I'm walking on eggshells, and I feel as though a lot of the things I'm saying in this gush of eagerness to comfort are just triggering you."
16515,"04/09/18, 10:22:43 PM",Pranathi," I really don't want to be one more stressor in your life, and none of the stuff I'm saying is really more than a lame effort to comfort you and let you know I'm there."
16516,"04/09/18, 10:23:17 PM",Sush," No, you're a giant source of comfort in my life!"
16517,"04/09/18, 10:23:27 PM",Sush," like, big fat"
16518,"04/09/18, 10:26:30 PM",Sush," I don't want you to feel wary around me also. I guess I just don't want to hear that other people get through it / it happens all the time. I know that in theory, it just doesn't really mitigate the fear I'm low-key feeling constantly. I know it isn't your intention to suggest that I'm freaking out over nothing, but maybe some words suggest that and I have to remind myself that that isn't your intention."
16519,"06/09/18, 1:10:25 AM",Pranathi, That sounds like 99 bottles on the wall
16520,"06/09/18, 1:10:31 AM",Pranathi, 99 bottles of beer on the wall
16521,"06/09/18, 1:10:33 AM",Pranathi, 99 bottles of beer
16522,"06/09/18, 1:10:41 AM",Pranathi, One fell off (and broke his head?)
16523,"06/09/18, 1:10:52 AM",Pranathi, I'm getting the sense that I'm mixing metaphors here
16524,"06/09/18, 1:10:59 AM",Pranathi, 98 bottles of beer on the wall
16525,"06/09/18, 1:11:03 AM",Pranathi, 98 bottles of beeeeer

16540,"06/09/18, 1:21:51 AM",Pranathi, That's CENTURIES of bigotry overthrown
16541,"06/09/18, 1:22:48 AM",Sush," Aaaaaaah one judge has said ‘377 is irrational, manifestly arbitrary and indefensible’ 😍"
16542,"06/09/18, 1:23:41 AM",Pranathi, Beautiful
16543,"06/09/18, 1:23:45 AM",Pranathi, That's so refreshing
16544,"06/09/18, 1:24:46 AM",Pranathi, An alliance of churches and a Christian group Trust of God Ministries have opposed scrapping of the colonial-era law.
16545,"06/09/18, 1:24:48 AM",Pranathi, !!

16553,"06/09/18, 1:26:47 AM",Pranathi, Even SHIV SENA
16554,"06/09/18, 1:26:53 AM",Pranathi, Supported decriminalizing
16555,"06/09/18, 1:27:00 AM",Sush, Also incredibly interesting that the RSS changed its official stance
16556,"06/09/18, 1:27:05 AM",Pranathi, Yeah!
16557,"06/09/18, 1:27:27 AM",Sush, I’m so happy everyone is like ‘THIS IS DUMB’

16566,"06/09/18, 1:28:28 AM",Pranathi, Honestly I always did think that the opposition to homosexuality is definitely more deeply rooted in Christian thought
16567,"06/09/18, 1:28:37 AM",Sush, true
16568,"06/09/18, 1:28:45 AM",Sush, All these temples and kamasutra and all
16569,"06/09/18, 1:28:59 AM",Pranathi, I'm sure sexualities were more policed for certain castes
16570,"06/09/18, 1:29:05 AM",Sush, for sure
16571,"06/09/18, 1:29:08 AM",Pranathi, But I don't think there's this scriptural stigma against homosexuality

16573,"06/09/18, 1:29:16 AM",Pranathi," Like, where to point and say"

16865,"13/09/18, 10:15:08 AM",Pranathi, Like I found myself offering
16866,"13/09/18, 10:15:12 AM",Pranathi, And I didn't even really want to do it
16867,"13/09/18, 10:15:19 AM",Pranathi, But it was almost like I felt obliged
16868,"13/09/18, 10:15:26 AM",Sush, ayyyooo
16869,"13/09/18, 10:15:27 AM",Pranathi," And she was nice about it, brought me some gifts and all"
16870,"13/09/18, 10:15:29 AM",Pranathi, But there's some change
16871,"13/09/18, 10:15:33 AM",Pranathi, Something has been said to her
16872,"13/09/18, 10:15:39 AM",Sush, Uday?
16873,"13/09/18, 10:15:47 AM",Pranathi," She is different with me, and Jonathan's also been cagey"
16874,"13/09/18, 10:15:49 AM",Pranathi, Uday's also been cagey
16875,"13/09/18, 10:15:54 AM",Pranathi, I don't know what's going on
16876,"13/09/18, 10:15:57 AM",Pranathi, But some mischief is afoot
16877,"13/09/18, 10:16:11 AM",Pranathi, Ayyo why for me getting in the middle of all these crazies
16878,"13/09/18, 10:16:13 AM",Sush, Ayyo so annoying
16879,"13/09/18, 10:16:26 AM",Pranathi, Are you coming back to HP today?
16880,"13/09/18, 10:16:30 AM",Pranathi, I don't want you to leave this neighborhood 
16881,"13/09/18, 10:16:33 AM",Pranathi, Don't leave meeeeeee
16882,"13/09/18, 10:20:06 AM",Sush, I’m not 
16883,"13/09/18, 10:20:53 AM",Sush, Riddhima is asking you to come chill with us
16884,"13/09/18, 10:21:07 AM",Sush, She is saying bring readings we will all do cafe hopping and work
16885,"13/09/18, 10:21:17 AM",Pranathi, Haha that sounds very chill!
16886,"13/09/18, 10:21:26 AM",Pranathi, But maybe tomorrow if you guys are hanging out there?
16887,"13/09/18, 10:21:37 AM",Pranathi, I have already started work and don't want to lose momentum now
16888,"13/09/18, 10:21:53 AM",Sush, Yesss tomorrow
16889,"13/09/18, 10:22:13 AM",Sush, Today we thought we’ll go to ISKCON temple

16891,"13/09/18, 10:37:21 AM",Sush, Oh my god I have to tell you this new angle proposed by Riddhima’s friend Joseph Joseph who is gay
16892,"13/09/18, 10:37:30 AM",Sush, He met Rodrigo and wanted to know if he was gay
16893,"13/09/18, 10:37:45 AM",Sush, Now all of this is making sense to me
16894,"13/09/18, 10:37:59 AM",Sush, It would explain everything doing like Jesse and his general reluctance to do I don’t know dating and all that
16895,"13/09/18, 10:38:16 AM",Sush, I am using dictation this is blowing my mind I can actually understand what I am saying.
16896,"13/09/18, 10:43:56 AM",Pranathi, Hahaha
16897,"13/09/18, 10:44:01 AM",Pranathi, Are you using dictation for the first time?
16898,"13/09/18, 10:44:12 AM",Pranathi," And ooh, yay for Ganesh puja plan"
16899,"13/09/18, 10:44:21 AM",Pranathi," Also, Rodrigo being gay makes a lot of sense!"
16900,"13/09/18, 10:44:34 AM",Pranathi, Do you think he's reluctant to come out of the closet?

17830,"09/10/18, 8:10:22 PM",Pranathi," Dude, I had the scariest experience with Loren. We were supposed to go to the Moth today. We got here and he was behaving sort of weirdly. Then when they announced the first storyteller, he ran up on stage. So I ran behind him. He tried to wrestle the microphone from the host's hand. And the lady was telling him to back off. I had to physically wrestle him off stage, and then he refused to go. So they called security and we both had to physically drag him off. He tried to take off his shirt."
17831,"09/10/18, 8:11:41 PM",Pranathi," Then as we were going to call him an Uber, he tried to touch me. He touched my butt and then aggressively tried to hold my hand. I freaked out and yelled at him, but he couldn't leave because he left his phone upstairs and so I had to go get it. The security didn't want him back inside. I called him an Uber on his phone and he left. I am shook."
17832,"09/10/18, 8:14:22 PM",Sush, wtf!!
17833,"09/10/18, 8:14:38 PM",Sush, you're home now?
17834,"09/10/18, 8:14:40 PM",Pranathi, I'm back at the show
17835,"09/10/18, 8:14:48 PM",Pranathi," I didn't want to leave, I paid money for this ticket"
17836,"09/10/18, 8:15:02 PM",Pranathi, And I thought maybe listening to the stories would be like healing or whatever
17837,"09/10/18, 8:15:05 PM",Sush, oh my god! i'm so sorry this happened - that sounds so scary!!
17838,"09/10/18, 8:15:36 PM",Pranathi," He just texted me saying ""I guess that was the wrong way to ask you out"""
17839,"09/10/18, 8:15:43 PM",Pranathi, Is there something wrong with em?
17840,"09/10/18, 8:15:44 PM",Sush, WTF
17841,"09/10/18, 8:15:44 PM",Pranathi, Me?
17842,"09/10/18, 8:15:48 PM",Sush, No!!
17843,"09/10/18, 8:15:54 PM",Pranathi, Am I inviting people to touch me?
17844,"09/10/18, 8:15:54 PM",Sush, you are PERFECT
17845,"09/10/18, 8:16:11 PM",Pranathi, How did I get into this situation? I feel so naive and stupid 
17846,"09/10/18, 8:16:14 PM",Pranathi, And embarrassed
17847,"09/10/18, 8:16:18 PM",Sush, this avalanche of people getting called out now also should make it so clear that it isn't about you!
17848,"09/10/18, 8:16:21 PM",Pranathi, There are so many people here from UChicago
17849,"09/10/18, 8:16:30 PM",Pranathi, I know it isn't. 
17850,"09/10/18, 8:16:38 PM",Sush, It _is_ so awful!
17851,"09/10/18, 8:16:46 PM",Pranathi," And I know I have no reason to be embarrassed, he's responsible for his own actions"
17852,"09/10/18, 8:16:51 PM",Sush, what's with all the aggression also?!
17853,"09/10/18, 8:16:57 PM",Pranathi, I can't hold responsibility for it
17854,"09/10/18, 8:17:04 PM",Sush, not at all
17855,"09/10/18, 8:17:07 PM",Pranathi, But the organizers here were clearly pissed
17856,"09/10/18, 8:17:10 PM",Pranathi, Of course
17857,"09/10/18, 8:17:12 PM",Sush, was he on drugs or drunk or something
17858,"09/10/18, 8:17:17 PM",Pranathi, And I felt so guilty for bringing him to this space
17859,"09/10/18, 8:17:35 PM",Sush," he hasn't behaved like this before, you had zero way of foreseeing this!"
17860,"09/10/18, 8:17:45 PM",Pranathi, I was smoking and we've done that before and it's been fine. But I think this time he had a psychotic break
17861,"09/10/18, 8:17:48 PM",Pranathi, I feel so guilty
17862,"09/10/18, 8:17:52 PM",Pranathi, I shouldn't have let him smoke
17863,"09/10/18, 8:18:12 PM",Pranathi," But again, I couldn't have known this would happen and he does it a lot. It's not like this is his first time"
17864,"09/10/18, 8:18:27 PM",Pranathi, I think he's bipolar so I think it triggered a manic episode
17865,"09/10/18, 8:18:37 PM",Sush, it sounds like such a scary episode!!
17866,"09/10/18, 8:18:42 PM",Pranathi, But he tells me he smokes with his friends and we've also smoked and this has never happened
17867,"09/10/18, 8:18:44 PM",Sush, you're not his parent also
17868,"09/10/18, 8:18:54 PM",Pranathi, And getting touched by him made me almost black out with rage
17869,"09/10/18, 8:18:55 PM",Sush, doesn't sound like even he could have foreseen it
17870,"09/10/18, 8:19:05 PM",Pranathi, So it was hard to act with empathy
17871,"09/10/18, 8:19:15 PM",Sush, that is very very fair
17872,"09/10/18, 8:19:56 PM",Sush, tell me if you want me to call you ❤
17873,"09/10/18, 8:20:03 PM",Sush," i love you, i'm so sorry this happened!"
17874,"09/10/18, 8:20:18 PM",Pranathi, The show has started again I'll call later?

18190,"22/10/18, 12:31:22 PM",Sush, and my mom and Didige and my sister have categorically declared it gross and ugly

18192,"22/10/18, 12:31:51 PM",Sush, the piercings!
18193,"22/10/18, 12:34:16 PM",Pranathi, You decided to get these piercings?!
18194,"22/10/18, 12:34:20 PM",Pranathi, You got them already?
18195,"22/10/18, 12:34:26 PM",Pranathi," They're terrible, no offense. "
18196,"22/10/18, 12:34:40 PM",Sush, 😂😂😂
18197,"22/10/18, 12:34:45 PM",Sush, I decided to get only
18198,"22/10/18, 12:34:54 PM",Sush, I’m slightly into how much everyone hates them
18199,"22/10/18, 12:35:15 PM",Sush, One girl in my lab has
18200,"22/10/18, 12:35:51 PM",Pranathi, Pls to not
18201,"22/10/18, 12:35:58 PM",Pranathi, WHAT PURPOSE does it serve!
18202,"22/10/18, 12:36:18 PM",Sush, Means preeetttyyy😂
18203,"22/10/18, 12:36:30 PM",Sush, I’m having piercing itch also
18204,"22/10/18, 12:37:23 PM",Pranathi, Haha I cannot able to understand that itch since I hate piercings.
18205,"22/10/18, 12:37:25 PM",Pranathi, But you do you girlfriend!
18206,"22/10/18, 12:37:33 PM",Pranathi, Aka I hate needles!
18207,"22/10/18, 12:37:37 PM",Pranathi, Not piercings as a rule
18208,"22/10/18, 12:38:51 PM",Sush, 😂
18209,"22/10/18, 12:41:40 PM",Pranathi," How do you feel about this sentence as a ""hook"" for my grant proposal?"
18210,"22/10/18, 12:41:42 PM",Pranathi," If the city is the theater for national politics, then the streets are its stage."
18211,"22/10/18, 12:42:03 PM",Pranathi, Then I go on to talk about how people immolated themselves on the streets during Mandal protests
18212,"22/10/18, 12:42:09 PM",Pranathi, Is it too cheesy?
18213,"22/10/18, 12:50:49 PM",Sush, Ayy I like it!
18214,"22/10/18, 12:51:03 PM",Sush, Go for it
18215,"22/10/18, 12:51:09 PM",Pranathi, Haha okay just checking 
18216,"22/10/18, 12:51:12 PM",Pranathi, Dude this is so hard
18217,"22/10/18, 12:51:17 PM",Pranathi, I deleted seven pages and I'm starting again
18218,"22/10/18, 12:51:30 PM",Sush, Oh man! Why did you delete
18219,"22/10/18, 12:52:11 PM",Pranathi, Because I realized it was a lot of blah blah without getting to my research design
18220,"22/10/18, 12:52:23 PM",Pranathi, But also it's so hard to set context and provide research design stuff within 10 double spaced pages
18221,"22/10/18, 12:52:30 PM",Pranathi, Especially since these fools don't know anything about caste
18222,"22/10/18, 12:52:53 PM",Pranathi," It's so easy to just start talking about methods and design if you're doing something like ""masculinity"" in America. You can assume there's some shared understanding."
18223,"22/10/18, 12:53:00 PM",Sush, True 
18224,"22/10/18, 12:53:05 PM",Sush, Yeah 
18225,"22/10/18, 12:53:07 PM",Pranathi, Yeah!! It's so unfair to me.
18226,"22/10/18, 12:53:25 PM",Pranathi," Like if I don't do context-setting, I run the risk of being taken less seriously because they just don't get the relevance of my project"
18227,"22/10/18, 12:53:38 PM",Sush, True 
18228,"22/10/18, 12:53:39 PM",Pranathi," But if I do, I have way less space to show them I know what I want to do and I have a research plan"
18229,"22/10/18, 12:54:03 PM",Sush, it's a little bit like in insti how we had to preface everything with 'why are SS important'
18230,"22/10/18, 12:54:24 PM",Pranathi, Lol exactly. It's exhausting to have to constantly make a case for self
18231,"22/10/18, 12:54:29 PM",Pranathi, Especially when running low on confidence haha
18232,"22/10/18, 12:54:34 PM",Sush, True 
18233,"22/10/18, 12:54:49 PM",Sush, if you want layperson to read something through this process i'm happy to ❤
18234,"22/10/18, 12:55:00 PM",Sush, if you think it'll be useful etc
18235,"22/10/18, 12:58:16 PM",Pranathi, That would be SO useful. ❤
18236,"22/10/18, 12:58:25 PM",Pranathi, I can send to you once I'm done?
18237,"22/10/18, 12:58:30 PM",Sush, ya ya!

18249,"22/10/18, 9:22:42 PM",Pranathi, Do you think it's very rude if I just say
18250,"22/10/18, 9:22:43 PM",Pranathi, No
18251,"22/10/18, 9:22:50 PM",Pranathi, Lol
18252,"22/10/18, 9:23:41 PM",Sush," Hi Anshuman, it is with a heavy heart that I must let you know that I’m afraid I’m not similarly inclined."
18253,"22/10/18, 9:23:52 PM",Pranathi, Hahaha.
18254,"22/10/18, 9:24:06 PM",Sush, Lol who talks like that it sounds sooooo fake
18255,"22/10/18, 9:24:05 PM",Pranathi, I want to literally ctrl C ctrl V that. That's brilliant.
18256,"22/10/18, 9:24:22 PM",Sush, Do it 😂😂
18257,"22/10/18, 9:24:41 PM",Sush," I’m still irritated at ‘anthropologue, you!’"
18258,"22/10/18, 9:24:56 PM",Sush, My phone tried to correct to Anthropologie lol
18259,"22/10/18, 9:25:22 PM",Pranathi," I can't believe he said ""anthropologue"""
18260,"22/10/18, 9:25:32 PM",Pranathi," I was like ew, that's not even what I am."
18261,"22/10/18, 9:25:46 PM",Sush, Literal singular purpose is to tell u he knows that word
18262,"22/10/18, 9:25:51 PM",Sush, And isn’t a ‘science type’
18263,"22/10/18, 9:26:29 PM",Pranathi, Dude I'm going on a coffee date with one GSU boy tomorrow
18264,"22/10/18, 9:26:34 PM",Pranathi, Not as date but I think he is very gorgeous
18265,"22/10/18, 9:26:48 PM",Pranathi," He's Mexican and very, very cute. Math PhD student"
18266,"22/10/18, 9:26:56 PM",Pranathi, Claudio Gonzales one boy. See on Facbeook

18268,"22/10/18, 9:27:13 PM",Sush, Oooh!
18269,"22/10/18, 9:27:19 PM",Pranathi," Anyway, it's not really a date. I'm just fantasizing, but it's really about being on the Solidarity Committee."
18270,"22/10/18, 9:27:26 PM",Pranathi, But he said he'd take me to go eat tacos for dinner.
18271,"22/10/18, 9:27:38 PM",Pranathi, Which sounds decidedly non-work. But also knowing my luck he's probably gay.
18272,"22/10/18, 9:28:28 PM",Sush, He’s cute!!
18273,"22/10/18, 9:28:28 PM",Pranathi, Or is already dating someone who is like a Victoria's Secret model.

18278,"22/10/18, 9:29:10 PM",Pranathi, And Kamil has slept with himmmm
18279,"22/10/18, 9:29:32 PM",Pranathi," Maybe! Anyway, he seems very smart also IRL"
18280,"22/10/18, 9:29:39 PM",Pranathi, He gave a speech at the GSU rally and he was so articulate
18281,"22/10/18, 9:29:45 PM",Pranathi," I was like ooh, heart eyes emoji"
18282,"22/10/18, 9:30:06 PM",Sush, So nice! Articulacy (is this a word) is so attractive
18283,"22/10/18, 11:54:48 PM",Pranathi," Haha it is very attractive. And I don't care, it sounds like a great word"
18284,"22/10/18, 11:55:42 PM",Pranathi, Also are you awake?
18285,"22/10/18, 11:55:48 PM",Pranathi, I had a very funny exchange with the one and only

18290,"23/10/18, 12:06:17 AM",Pranathi, And this Sneha pinged and asked what I was doing
18291,"23/10/18, 12:06:23 AM",Pranathi, I want to sing at open mic so I told her I was practicing it
18292,"23/10/18, 12:06:30 AM",Pranathi, And I asked her if she wanted to hear. 
18293,"23/10/18, 12:06:34 AM",Pranathi, Then I got this hahaha

18305,"23/10/18, 12:09:28 AM",Pranathi, I definitely don't think that's coming from a place of kindness and all
18306,"23/10/18, 12:09:38 AM",Sush, True 
18307,"23/10/18, 12:09:53 AM",Pranathi, I hate to mistrust her intentions. But also why for me to send it to her
18308,"23/10/18, 12:10:06 AM",Pranathi, I could just say I suck at everything and she is only great
18309,"23/10/18, 12:10:11 AM",Pranathi, My mom said I was asking for it lol

18351,"23/10/18, 12:24:57 AM",Pranathi, I'm still doing rhetorical analysis of Sneha's text lol
18352,"23/10/18, 12:25:02 AM",Pranathi, That is only flummoxing me
18353,"23/10/18, 12:25:09 AM",Pranathi," ""Like the rasa of the ghazal is so longing and despair this drunken melancholy - I mean, unless you’re going for a full revamp!"""
18354,"23/10/18, 12:25:13 AM",Pranathi, WHAT A CATTY THING TO SAY LOL
18355,"23/10/18, 12:29:02 AM",Sush, Lolol!!
18356,"23/10/18, 12:29:17 AM",Sush, It is pretty textbook catty😂
18357,"[23/10/18, 12:29:22 AM",Sush, ‎image omitted
18358,"23/10/18, 12:29:48 AM",Pranathi, It's disgusting. I can't deal lol. I think I should go back to distancing
18359,"23/10/18, 12:30:00 AM",Pranathi, Like why be catty about something that literally shouldn't cost you anything to be happy about?
18360,"23/10/18, 12:30:02 AM",Sush, I didn’t notice the ‘full revamp’ part 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️
18361,"23/10/18, 12:30:07 AM",Pranathi, It's so toxic!
18362,"23/10/18, 12:30:13 AM",Sush, True!
18363,"23/10/18, 12:30:21 AM",Pranathi," She does't even like to sing or anything. It's literally my thing, and I am no competition to her!"
18364,"23/10/18, 12:30:31 AM",Sush, and just say inane polite things and take lite if you’re not interested
18365,"23/10/18, 12:30:31 AM",Pranathi, What shitty behavior. I cannot able
18366,"23/10/18, 12:30:43 AM",Pranathi, Yeah like don't even respond I don't care bitch
18367,"23/10/18, 12:30:58 AM",Pranathi, Don't take the time to type out something that is intended to DESTROY someone's confidence.
18368,"23/10/18, 12:31:01 AM",Pranathi, And poke them where it hurts
18369,"23/10/18, 12:31:17 AM",Pranathi," Like singing is such a vulnerable thing to do first of all, then to share. Just don't even say anything if you can't be nice."
18370,"23/10/18, 12:31:28 AM",Sush, Fair 
18371,"23/10/18, 12:31:35 AM",Sush, Distancing is better really
18372,"23/10/18, 12:31:44 AM",Sush, Engage superficially
18373,"23/10/18, 12:31:52 AM",Sush, Too keep civility
18374,"23/10/18, 12:32:02 AM",Pranathi, She does weird overtures of friendship and I got briefly bamboozled again
18375,"23/10/18, 12:32:08 AM",Pranathi, Today she gushed about how happy she is that I'm here and all
18376,"23/10/18, 12:32:13 AM",Sush, I totally hear ya
18377,"23/10/18, 12:32:18 AM",Pranathi, But it's only because she's feeling distanced by those catty white women in Kristen's group
18378,"23/10/18, 12:32:23 AM",Sush, That’s where This gets tricky
18379,"23/10/18, 12:32:24 AM",Pranathi, So she's back to being nice.
18380,"23/10/18, 12:32:34 AM",Sush, Very hard to negotiate
18381,"24/10/18, 1:05:04 PM",Pranathi, Hi friend
18382,"24/10/18, 1:05:08 PM",Pranathi, How are you?
18383,"24/10/18, 1:05:11 PM",Pranathi, Is your phone okay?

18392,"24/10/18, 1:38:40 PM",Pranathi, I am fine. At some boring af job talk
18393,"24/10/18, 1:38:55 PM",Pranathi, I got coffee with Claudio yesterday!
18394,"24/10/18, 1:39:05 PM",Pranathi, I think he may be into me? But maybe he's also just being nice?
18395,"[24/10/18, 1:39:19 PM",Pranathi, ‎image omitted
18396,"24/10/18, 1:46:04 PM",Sush, so sweet!

18399,"24/10/18, 1:46:48 PM",Sush," I was feeling a little off yesterday, so I just burrowed. Feeling a lot better today ❤ You, my friend?"
18400,"24/10/18, 1:47:02 PM",Sush, he sounds so polite and shareef
18401,"24/10/18, 1:51:42 PM",Pranathi, Aww kya hua?
18402,"24/10/18, 1:52:13 PM",Pranathi, Yeah I was really into him. He's so cute 😭
18403,"24/10/18, 1:53:38 PM",Sush, ayyy! cooking together is a cute first date!
18404,"24/10/18, 1:53:40 PM",Sush, or second?
18405,"24/10/18, 1:54:04 PM",Pranathi, But do you think he's asking me on a date?
18406,"24/10/18, 1:54:12 PM",Pranathi, Or does that text sound like he's just trying to be friends?
18407,"24/10/18, 1:54:23 PM",Pranathi, And what happened? Why did you feel off?
18408,"24/10/18, 1:55:13 PM",Sush, i can't tell from the text tbh! but take him up on that - we will gather more cues!
18409,"24/10/18, 1:55:28 PM",Sush, if he's straight it probs means he's into you
18410,"24/10/18, 1:56:22 PM",Pranathi, He's bi!
18411,"24/10/18, 1:56:49 PM",Sush, maybe just the receding seratonin levels 🤦‍♀ and i also realized i'm missing my mom's 60th bday puja - her fam will be coming to chennai etc
18412,"24/10/18, 1:57:30 PM",Sush, ohh ok ok! i like his text to you a lot - it's nice and straightforward and opens expressly enthusiasm
18413,"24/10/18, 2:16:00 PM",Pranathi, Aww. 
18414,"24/10/18, 2:16:07 PM",Pranathi, Did you call insurance people?
18415,"24/10/18, 2:16:30 PM",Pranathi, And yeah I like it too. He seems well in touch with his emotions. But he didn't respond to the when question and it's been all day lol
18416,"24/10/18, 2:33:18 PM",Sush, Nov 30! her nakshatram birthday
18417,"24/10/18, 2:33:36 PM",Sush, lol maybe he's just at work

18419,"24/10/18, 11:00:11 PM",Sush, Ooooh! Enti??
18420,"24/10/18, 11:00:41 PM",Pranathi, Brie smothered in apricot preserves and wrapped in filo pastry and baked
18421,"24/10/18, 11:00:44 PM",Pranathi, Then served on an apple. 
18422,"24/10/18, 11:00:59 PM",Sush, Yummm!!
18423,"24/10/18, 11:01:08 PM",Sush, You made?
18424,"24/10/18, 11:01:42 PM",Pranathi, YES
18425,"24/10/18, 11:01:45 PM",Pranathi, For fam dinner 
18426,"24/10/18, 11:01:55 PM",Pranathi, It was supposed to be something that showed your personality
18427,"24/10/18, 11:01:58 PM",Pranathi, That was the theme
18428,"24/10/18, 11:02:13 PM",Pranathi, I didn't have time and I saw this on some video. This takes half an hour cause there's no cooking really
18429,"24/10/18, 11:02:34 PM",Pranathi, So my personality is sort of crusty on the outside but warm and gooey on the inside
18430,"24/10/18, 11:02:47 PM",Pranathi, Sometimes I'm flaky with responding to texts
18431,"24/10/18, 11:02:51 PM",Pranathi, And I'm sometimes baked 
18432,"24/10/18, 11:04:36 PM",Pranathi, How are you feeling?
18433,"24/10/18, 11:21:40 PM",Sush, Haha cuuuute

18439,"24/10/18, 11:33:31 PM",Pranathi, Did doctor call you!
18440,"24/10/18, 11:33:35 PM",Pranathi, What did you eat!
18441,"24/10/18, 11:34:57 PM",Sush, No she didn’t 🤬🤬
18442,"24/10/18, 11:35:05 PM",Sush, I had chole
18443,"24/10/18, 11:35:12 PM",Sush, But it didn’t turn out great
18444,"24/10/18, 11:35:21 PM",Pranathi, Useless fucking lady
18445,"24/10/18, 11:35:31 PM",Sush, Ya dude I don’t want to talk to her
18446,"24/10/18, 11:35:45 PM",Sush, I’m also traumatised at the idea of REPEATING the whole story
18447,"24/10/18, 11:35:47 PM",Pranathi, Ayyo!
18448,"24/10/18, 11:35:53 PM",Sush, Like I can’t

18465,"24/10/18, 11:37:45 PM",Pranathi, Men are boring
18466,"24/10/18, 11:37:52 PM",Sush, Men suck at everything omg

18499,"27/10/18, 10:26:27 AM",Sush, Dude I can’t find my passport
18500,"27/10/18, 10:26:38 AM",Sush, I thought I put it at work and just came to check
18501,"27/10/18, 10:26:41 AM",Sush, But it isn’t there
18502,"27/10/18, 10:26:48 AM",Sush, I searched the whole house yesterday
18503,"27/10/18, 10:27:03 AM",Sush, Either I lost it or put it someplace ‘safe’ that I just can’t recall
18504,"27/10/18, 10:29:01 AM",Pranathi, Hi!
18505,"27/10/18, 10:29:17 AM",Pranathi, Did you submit it to someone for office stuff?
18506,"27/10/18, 10:29:21 AM",Sush, I lose EVERYTHING if I lose that. It has my work authorisation tucked into it.
18507,"27/10/18, 10:29:30 AM",Sush, I took it to HR last week to show them
18508,"27/10/18, 10:29:41 AM",Sush, I see the other documents I took to them at home
18509,"27/10/18, 10:29:47 AM",Sush, but not my passport and EAD
18510,"27/10/18, 10:30:04 AM",Pranathi, Did you usually keep the passport in the folder?
18511,"27/10/18, 10:30:10 AM",Sush, Yeah
18512,"27/10/18, 10:30:34 AM",Pranathi, Is there any way it could've fallen out of it into your bag?
18513,"27/10/18, 10:30:47 AM",Sush, I remember double checking that I put it inside at HR office
18514,"27/10/18, 10:30:55 AM",Sush," I mean, I don’t think so?"
18515,"27/10/18, 10:31:21 AM",Pranathi, Did you have to take it out again after that?
18516,"27/10/18, 10:31:29 AM",Pranathi, Like is there a spot in your office?
18517,"27/10/18, 10:31:36 AM",Pranathi, Or a locker or desk?
18518,"27/10/18, 10:32:07 AM",Pranathi, Don't panic. We'll find it. 💕 I'm sure it's hiding somewhere in plain sight
18519,"27/10/18, 10:40:28 AM",Sush, But I’m worried I didn’t close my bag properly or someone  stole it or something
18520,"27/10/18, 10:41:42 AM",Pranathi, No one would have any use for your passport to try and steal it. I'm sure it'll be around. Just give it an hour or so. Maybe you'll remember if there was some spot you chose to keep it
18521,"27/10/18, 10:46:15 AM",Sush, I went to work to check
18522,"27/10/18, 10:46:17 AM",Sush, It wasn’t there
18523,"27/10/18, 10:46:41 AM",Sush, I have to pick up my credit card at the post office and I’m worried they won’t give it to me without my passport
18524,"27/10/18, 10:46:51 AM",Sush, I’m v v v v v screwed if I can’t pick it up
18525,"27/10/18, 10:47:40 AM",Pranathi, Do you have any other ID?
18526,"27/10/18, 10:48:04 AM",Pranathi, Maybe they'll just need some photo ID with your name
18527,"27/10/18, 10:48:15 AM",Pranathi, When do you have to go to the post office?
18528,"27/10/18, 10:48:21 AM",Sush, I have my northwestern ID on me
18529,"27/10/18, 10:48:25 AM",Sush, I’m there now
18530,"27/10/18, 10:49:15 AM",Sush, Ugggghhhhjhhh
18531,"27/10/18, 10:49:19 AM",Sush, I resent everything
18532,"27/10/18, 10:49:24 AM",Sush," Myself, mostly"
18533,"27/10/18, 10:49:29 AM",Sush, Chronic fuckup
18534,"27/10/18, 10:49:40 AM",Sush, I was feeling so good yesterday
18535,"27/10/18, 10:49:49 AM",Sush, Then looked for passport to go to a bar
18536,"27/10/18, 10:49:57 AM",Sush, Searched searched searched
18537,"27/10/18, 10:50:07 AM",Sush, My house is upside down from searching
18538,"27/10/18, 10:50:14 AM",Sush, I’ll go back and continue searching
18539,"27/10/18, 10:50:22 AM",Sush, I’m sorry for screwing up our plans also 
18540,"27/10/18, 10:50:46 AM",Pranathi," No don't worry about all that. We'll reschedule, but you don't resent yourself and all"
18541,"27/10/18, 10:50:49 AM",Pranathi, I'm sure you'll find it
18542,"27/10/18, 10:51:00 AM",Pranathi, It's probably just sitting there being devilish
18543,"27/10/18, 10:51:18 AM",Pranathi, Call me if you feel like talking
18544,"27/10/18, 10:51:26 AM",Pranathi, I know it can be v v v stressful!
18545,"27/10/18, 10:53:51 AM",Sush, Fucking bitch wouldn’t give me the mail

19216,"17/11/18, 1:14:06 PM",Pranathi, Who feels entitled to more space or something so she is making a big fuss and throwing body positivity around loosely a lot
19217,"17/11/18, 1:21:49 PM",Sush, Ugh yakkkk

19254,"18/11/18, 10:12:49 PM",Sush, Clearly we’re both feeling a bit bleak
19255,"18/11/18, 10:12:56 PM",Sush, so here are some 💕💕💕
19256,"18/11/18, 11:10:24 PM",Pranathi, Aww here are some for you too 💕💕💕
19257,"18/11/18, 11:10:33 PM",Pranathi, Sorry you are feeling bleak 
19258,"18/11/18, 11:11:58 PM",Pranathi, I am also feeling meh
19259,"19/11/18, 3:15:28 PM",Sush, duuude
19260,"19/11/18, 3:15:32 PM",Sush, i snapped at erin
19261,"19/11/18, 3:15:51 PM",Sush, i was initially annoyed and i thought i'd just let it go because she's having a rough week
19262,"19/11/18, 3:16:01 PM",Sush, because of school work
19263,"19/11/18, 3:16:11 PM",Sush, then she caught me at a time i was VERY hungry
19264,"19/11/18, 3:16:18 PM",Sush, and i snapped off🤦‍♀
19265,"19/11/18, 3:16:49 PM",Pranathi, Ayyo 
19266,"19/11/18, 3:16:57 PM",Pranathi, What did she do?
19267,"19/11/18, 3:17:13 PM",Sush," first at the lab meeting she was like 'i have some thoughts on what you're doing, i'll tell you'"
19268,"19/11/18, 3:17:17 PM",Sush, like whether i asked????
19269,"19/11/18, 3:17:55 PM",Sush, and then she wrote those thoughts down on our project management thing saying v obvious things and being like why don't you google 'event disambiguation'
19270,"19/11/18, 3:18:20 PM",Sush, idk - i feel like for andy to see her telling me to try these obvious things (that i've already tried) makes it look like i'm slacking
19271,"19/11/18, 3:18:55 PM",Sush, when i saw her something she was saying and i was like erin OF COURSE I GOOGLED IT
19272,"19/11/18, 3:18:57 PM",Pranathi, Yeah that's fair. It's definitely not flattering
19273,"19/11/18, 3:19:15 PM",Pranathi, Caps = yelling?
19274,"19/11/18, 3:19:17 PM",Sush, and like why are you even giving me suggestions
19275,"19/11/18, 3:19:25 PM",Sush, i said it with an edge
19276,"19/11/18, 3:19:35 PM",Sush, and she was like oh of course of course sorry i was being a jerk
19277,"19/11/18, 3:19:42 PM",Sush, but wanted to say JUST IN CASE
19278,"19/11/18, 3:19:50 PM",Sush," like, wtf"
19279,"19/11/18, 3:19:57 PM",Sush, how stupid am i? that i won't GOOGLE MY TASK?
19280,"19/11/18, 3:20:09 PM",Pranathi, Ughhhh do you think she is wanting to impress Andy?
19281,"19/11/18, 3:20:15 PM",Sush, maybe??
19282,"19/11/18, 3:20:21 PM",Sush," and like, why are you telling me what to try"
19283,"19/11/18, 3:20:22 PM",Pranathi, Like acting oversmart just so he'll notice
19284,"19/11/18, 3:20:26 PM",Sush, i never asked you
19285,"19/11/18, 3:20:37 PM",Pranathi, Yeah it's very undermining!
19286,"19/11/18, 3:20:38 PM",Sush," not to pull rank, but like, this is my JOB"
19287,"19/11/18, 3:20:49 PM",Sush, you do this when your school schedule allows it
19288,"19/11/18, 3:21:16 PM",Sush," within the structure of the lab, technically, she reports to me"
19289,"19/11/18, 3:21:25 PM",Sush, she's an intern on my project
19290,"19/11/18, 3:21:44 PM",Pranathi, She must be super insecure about that
19291,"19/11/18, 3:21:59 PM",Pranathi, Not that it excuses her adhikaprasangithanam
19292,"19/11/18, 3:22:00 PM",Sush, and i don't want to play it like that - i want to be collaborative about it - but don't tell me what to do 
19293,"19/11/18, 3:22:20 PM",Sush, ya and like she desperately wanted the phd and she's gotten her fav program
19294,"19/11/18, 3:22:21 PM",Sush, be happy no
19295,"19/11/18, 3:23:23 PM",Pranathi," Yeah I would just tell her like, didn't mean to snap but maybe don't undercut me like that at meetings"
19296,"19/11/18, 3:26:00 PM",Sush, yeah 
19297,"19/11/18, 3:26:10 PM",Sush, Andy will see and be like Sush didn’t google it???
19298,"19/11/18, 3:26:15 PM",Sush, Lol
19299,"19/11/18, 3:26:43 PM",Pranathi, Lolol I'm sure he knows you googled it
19300,"19/11/18, 3:27:03 PM",Pranathi, Honestly this probably makes Erin look stupid more than you
19301,"19/11/18, 3:27:47 PM",Sush, 😅🤦🏽‍♀️
19302,"19/11/18, 3:27:53 PM",Sush, I was so hangry and irritated
19303,"19/11/18, 3:28:07 PM",Sush, Now I ate lunch and I’m feeling less annoyed
19304,"19/11/18, 3:28:11 PM",Sush, How are you my love
19305,"[19/11/18, 3:28:21 PM",Sush, ‎image omitted
19306,"19/11/18, 3:32:04 PM",Pranathi, I am fine!
19307,"19/11/18, 3:32:13 PM",Pranathi, Just made myself a little snack which I shouldn't have
19308,"19/11/18, 3:32:17 PM",Pranathi, It is basically mug cake lol
19309,"19/11/18, 3:32:22 PM",Pranathi, Why such indulgence!
19310,"19/11/18, 3:32:40 PM",Pranathi, I am glad you're feeling less annoyed! Your face is shining!
19311,"19/11/18, 3:36:50 PM",Sush, That sounds delicious
19312,"19/11/18, 3:42:24 PM",Sush, What mug cake was it?
19313,"19/11/18, 3:51:57 PM",Pranathi, Peanut butter!
19314,"19/11/18, 3:52:07 PM",Pranathi, I chose that one because you don't need eggs and I don't have eggs.
19315,"19/11/18, 3:53:04 PM",Pranathi," It's super easy. Just two tbsps of peanut butter, tea tbsps of flour, one tbsp sugar, two tbsps milk (I used vanilla creamer for vanilla flavor), and a quarter tsp baking powder. Just mix it all up in a mug and stick it in the microwave for 1 minute."
19316,"19/11/18, 3:53:08 PM",Pranathi, It was so nice with coffee.
19317,"19/11/18, 3:53:23 PM",Sush, Yumm!!
19318,"19/11/18, 3:53:38 PM",Pranathi," Yeah, it's quite surprising how easy these mug cakes are."
19319,"19/11/18, 3:53:50 PM",Sush, I’m going to make this with almond butter
19320,"19/11/18, 3:53:58 PM",Sush, I ❤️ almond butter
19321,"19/11/18, 3:53:59 PM",Pranathi, And perfect portion size unlike this bloody country where everything is ridiculously large
19322,"19/11/18, 3:54:00 PM",Pranathi, Yeah make!
19323,"19/11/18, 3:54:04 PM",Sush, Correct!
19324,"19/11/18, 3:54:05 PM",Pranathi, That would be so nice
19325,"19/11/18, 3:54:11 PM",Sush, I like almond butter so much
19326,"19/11/18, 3:54:22 PM",Sush, My stupid mother loves
19327,"19/11/18, 3:54:50 PM",Pranathi, Haha I don't think I've ever tried it tbh
19328,"19/11/18, 3:55:01 PM",Sush, Ohh I think you’ll like
19329,"19/11/18, 3:55:13 PM",Sush, Esp if you generally like almonds
19330,"19/11/18, 3:55:36 PM",Pranathi, I loooove almonds
19331,"19/11/18, 3:56:02 PM",Pranathi," Actually the year I went to Nick's parents' for Christmas, we made almond marzipan cookies together to take them as a gift"
19332,"19/11/18, 3:56:12 PM",Pranathi, We put it in mason jars and tied it with twine. It was really cute
19333,"19/11/18, 3:56:42 PM",Sush, cuuute
19334,"19/11/18, 3:57:04 PM",Pranathi, Ofc it was all my idea. But Nick was a great companion for cooking/baking projects
19335,"19/11/18, 3:57:19 PM",Pranathi," He was always enthu to give it a go and was actually good at cooking stuff, so I didn't have to worry about him being a buffoon in the kitchen"
19336,"19/11/18, 3:57:31 PM",Pranathi, I think it's a real turnoff to me when men are terrible at cooking or say they can't do it...
19337,"19/11/18, 3:58:13 PM",Sush, Agreeee
19338,"19/11/18, 3:58:33 PM",Sush, it’s almost always gendered socialisation that makes them say that
19339,"19/11/18, 4:00:08 PM",Pranathi, Agreed
19340,"19/11/18, 4:00:21 PM",Pranathi, Dude I am feeling like I've put on a ton of weight recently
19341,"19/11/18, 4:00:57 PM",Sush, same 
19342,"19/11/18, 4:01:13 PM",Sush, I checked my weight on Sunday and cried lol Rodrigo was startled
19343,"19/11/18, 4:01:51 PM",Sush, If it helps at all - you look 🤩
19344,"19/11/18, 4:02:13 PM",Pranathi, Aww thank you
19345,"19/11/18, 4:02:33 PM",Pranathi, I try not to bring it up around you because you've mentioned before that it feels triggering. But today I think I am feeling worse than usual for some reason
19346,"19/11/18, 4:02:38 PM",Pranathi, Sorry if this is annoying 
19347,"19/11/18, 4:02:58 PM",Sush, No no it’s not - I can fully empathise
19348,"19/11/18, 4:03:13 PM",Sush, the nature of winter clothes also doesn’t help that feeling AT ALL
19349,"19/11/18, 4:03:38 PM",Pranathi, Yeah and I checked my weight and it's gone up. Plus I spent all morning around Rebecca who was describing her eating disorder thoughts
19350,"19/11/18, 4:04:00 PM",Pranathi," And I just felt really bad about how I've been treating my body. Not eating ""healthy"" or whatever plus not exercising."
19351,"19/11/18, 4:04:42 PM",Pranathi," I don't think she meant it to throw shade on my eating/exercise habits, but it definitely felt like I was being criticized because of my own insecurity I guess."
19352,"19/11/18, 4:04:49 PM",Pranathi," And yeah, bloody FAT ass jacket."
19353,"19/11/18, 4:05:53 PM",Sush, That sucks man 
19354,"19/11/18, 4:06:12 PM",Pranathi, Yeah... And saying they're not doing things that I definitely don't do.
19355,"19/11/18, 4:06:25 PM",Pranathi, She said she exercised only 4 instead of 5 times this week and I felt VERY UPSET
19356,"19/11/18, 4:06:49 PM",Pranathi," But that's really on me, so I'm over it. I clearly made mug cake to inure myself with all that sugar lol"
19357,"19/11/18, 4:07:43 PM",Sush, hahaha
19358,"19/11/18, 4:07:54 PM",Sush, yeah that's hard for both of you 
19359,"19/11/18, 4:08:46 PM",Pranathi," Yeah, I don't blame her for it. I know that's coming from a place she can't control. But it's still hard to hear"
19360,"19/11/18, 4:08:58 PM",Pranathi, And even harder not to take personally.
19361,"19/11/18, 4:09:18 PM",Sush, that's fair!
19362,"19/11/18, 4:09:37 PM",Sush, what do you think will make you feel stronger / healthier in your own body?
19363,"19/11/18, 4:11:22 PM",Pranathi," Maybe working out, but I know I shouldn't do that as a response to this stimulus. I will only do it reactively and it'll fizzle out"
19364,"19/11/18, 4:11:31 PM",Pranathi, I really want to go to dance class again when I'm back in Chennai
19365,"19/11/18, 4:11:46 PM",Pranathi, And meanwhile maybe I should just go to the gym 2-3 times a week
19366,"19/11/18, 4:11:49 PM",Sush, that's a great idea!
19367,"19/11/18, 4:12:15 PM",Sush, i really think something that is FUN to us and happens to be good for the body is only sustainable
19368,"19/11/18, 4:13:37 PM",Sush, idk if this will help - but you sounded like you were enjoying the weights stuff at the gym last year
19369,"19/11/18, 4:14:01 PM",Pranathi," It was fun. But now I know so many people that are there all the time, like that bloody Brandon"
19370,"19/11/18, 4:14:16 PM",Pranathi, And he made some comment once about how he was laughing at someone who was using the weights incorrectly or something
19371,"19/11/18, 4:14:20 PM",Sush, lol 2 TRUE
19372,"19/11/18, 4:14:29 PM",Pranathi, I realized that it's made me super self conscious now to go and just mess around
19373,"19/11/18, 4:14:37 PM",Sush, ugggh brandon you're so lame people must laugh at you all the time just walking
19374,"19/11/18, 4:14:43 PM",Pranathi, Because I don't want people like Brandon to be thinking shit about me as I work out and feel so vulnerable
19375,"19/11/18, 4:14:54 PM",Pranathi, Yeah! And Brandon's probably one of the nicer gym rats.
19376,"20/11/18, 3:11:42 PM",Pranathi, ‎Missed voice call
19377,"20/11/18, 6:34:41 PM",Pranathi," Dude, can you call me? I am bleeding when I poop and my abdomen is hurting"
19378,"20/11/18, 6:35:00 PM",Pranathi, And I feel like I am wanting to go more than normal
19379,"20/11/18, 6:35:08 PM",Pranathi, Do you think I have colon cancer?
19380,"20/11/18, 6:35:12 PM",Pranathi, Or intestinal bleeding?
19381,"20/11/18, 6:35:18 PM",Pranathi, I am freaking out
19382,"[20/11/18, 8:22:17 PM",Sush, ‎image omitted

19631,"03/12/18, 7:45:56 PM",Pranathi, I have an ideaaaaa
19632,"03/12/18, 7:48:58 PM",Pranathi," Wouldn't it be interesting to see what comes up on google when you type in the name of a country? For example, type in Switzerland or Chile or Portugal, and Google tells you ""things to do"" in these countries. They seem to be categorized as these sexy tourist destinations with no real news of ""global importance"" to boast of. But if you google China or India or Turkey, Google tells you latest news items. Either they're always under scrutiny because they could be potentially problematic for the powers that be, or they're places that are newsworthy in a way that the Switzerland touristy types are not. And then if you google like, East Timor, it shows you Wikipedia first because they *expect* you to not know much about it anyway. It would be a sort of fun project to see which countries are categorized as which Google item as a reflection on geopolitics I think!"
19633,"03/12/18, 11:31:36 PM",Sush, That’s a great idea!
19634,"04/12/18, 11:37:08 AM",Sush, hi friend

20438,"28/12/18, 9:28:23 AM",Pranathi," Just like, being condescending about things. And nobody has asked me about fieldwork or what I do or anything yet"
20439,"28/12/18, 9:28:37 AM",Pranathi, And literally Swetha sat with her body positioned away from me the whole time
20440,"28/12/18, 9:28:59 AM",Pranathi, Then she said something about some makeup and I asked what that was and she looked at me like I was so basic for not knowing something so obvious
20441,"28/12/18, 9:29:02 AM",Pranathi, Just dumb shit
20442,"28/12/18, 9:29:11 AM",Pranathi, But it adds up in these contexts I feel

20448,"28/12/18, 9:30:35 AM",Sush, Whom can we enlist?
20449,"28/12/18, 9:30:38 AM",Pranathi, Manasa is sweet
20450,"28/12/18, 9:30:45 AM",Pranathi, She is very cute and nice
20451,"28/12/18, 9:30:54 AM",Sush, That’s a relief
20452,"28/12/18, 9:30:54 AM",Pranathi, I felt very fondly
20453,"28/12/18, 9:31:07 AM",Pranathi, I was trying to express affection to Swetha and she visibly pulled away and went UGH
20454,"28/12/18, 9:31:24 AM",Pranathi, I get she's not super PDA but it was very awkward
20455,"28/12/18, 9:31:35 AM",Sush, Ugh
20456,"28/12/18, 9:31:58 AM",Pranathi," And I said something about some movie in Kannada and said it was good, and she goes ""Ew Kannada movies"""
20457,"28/12/18, 9:32:05 AM",Pranathi, Just being really neg-y
20458,"28/12/18, 9:32:09 AM",Pranathi, And not pleasant
20459,"28/12/18, 9:32:32 AM",Pranathi, And that's a super uncomfortable context to be in for a reunion
20460,"28/12/18, 9:32:45 AM",Pranathi, We aren't close enough for her to be taking these liberties I feel
20461,"28/12/18, 9:32:55 AM",Pranathi, But maybe I'm just being overly sensitive
20462,"28/12/18, 9:33:02 AM",Pranathi, When are coconuts leaving?
20463,"28/12/18, 9:33:44 AM",Sush, Reunions are emotionally draining also
20464,"28/12/18, 9:33:58 AM",Sush, So many people trying to renegotiate these equations
20465,"28/12/18, 9:34:16 AM",Sush, It’s not the place to be randomly rude
20466,"28/12/18, 9:34:33 AM",Sush, I hate this idea also that it’s ok to be rude to ‘close’ people
20467,"28/12/18, 9:35:18 AM",Pranathi," Yeah for sure. I tripped or something and she goes ""What are you even doing?!"""
20468,"28/12/18, 9:35:32 AM",Pranathi, It was so aggro for no real reason and it was so weird
20469,"28/12/18, 9:35:38 AM",Pranathi, I also hate that idea!
20470,"28/12/18, 9:35:44 AM",Pranathi, What you did today?
20471,"28/12/18, 9:36:48 AM",Sush, I took my cousin shopping
20472,"28/12/18, 9:36:54 AM",Sush, and coconuts arrived
20473,"28/12/18, 9:37:02 AM",Sush, They’ve been coconuting
20474,"28/12/18, 9:37:13 AM",Sush, My cousin Deepak and his daughter are sweethearts
20475,"28/12/18, 9:37:30 AM",Sush, She calls me chittu bua😍 she’s a precious little thing
20476,"28/12/18, 9:38:47 AM",Pranathi, Awww that's so cute!!

20494,"29/12/18, 10:47:46 PM",Pranathi," I'm good! Just some anxiety over not doing enough, not getting enough material for fieldwork stuff. But also it's been less than three weeks, so trying not to beat myself up."
20495,"29/12/18, 10:47:46 PM",Sush, but they're sweet
20496,"29/12/18, 10:48:28 PM",Pranathi," I was supposed to go to some panel discussion this morning by Swarnamalya, but it was in T. Nagar at 9 and I ended up sleeping in. So feel a little annoyed at myself for that..."
20497,"29/12/18, 10:48:44 PM",Sush, ayyo! you've been running so hard this month
20498,"29/12/18, 10:48:57 PM",Pranathi, But whatever. I keep feeling FOMO but there's no way I can possibly attend the million things going on all at once.
20499,"29/12/18, 10:49:11 PM",Pranathi," Yeah, trying to go easy on myself. It's hard especially without a vehicle in the city"
20500,"29/12/18, 10:49:22 PM",Pranathi, Aww. The daughter is the one that calls you chitthi bua?
20501,"29/12/18, 10:49:23 PM",Sush, true! you can literally only be in one place at a time also
20502,"29/12/18, 10:49:29 PM",Sush, chittu bua!
20503,"29/12/18, 10:50:29 PM",Pranathi, Aww Chittuuu

20508,"29/12/18, 10:51:15 PM",Pranathi," Well there are times when I'm not in any place but my bed also, but I guess those moments of downtime also are necessary"
20509,"29/12/18, 10:51:25 PM",Pranathi, I miss you too! It's been forever since we spoke I feel 
20510,"29/12/18, 10:51:42 PM",Sush, for sure - esp because you have to engage so much!
20511,"29/12/18, 10:51:45 PM",Sush, how to recharge
20512,"29/12/18, 10:51:53 PM",Sush, it HAS been forever -_-
20513,"29/12/18, 10:52:03 PM",Sush, my house has been bursting at its seams
20514,"29/12/18, 10:52:15 PM",Sush, dude my cousin asked my father for coconut oil
20515,"29/12/18, 10:52:18 PM",Sush, he burst out laughing
20516,"29/12/18, 10:52:33 PM",Sush," 'coconut oil! srikant ku coconut, i mean coconut oil!'"
20517,"29/12/18, 10:52:50 PM",Pranathi, Yeah that's why I also figured we'd talk when things calm down a little for you too. So much family time! Must have been exhausting to deal with those mean coconut cousins that were rude to your sister.
20518,"29/12/18, 10:52:53 PM",Pranathi, HAHAHA.
20519,"29/12/18, 10:53:07 PM",Pranathi, OMG. Does Srikant understand the coconut moniker?
20520,"29/12/18, 10:53:16 PM",Sush, 😂😂 idk!
20521,"29/12/18, 10:53:29 PM",Sush," but he wouldn't think it applies to him because him, brown outside? what?"
20522,"29/12/18, 10:53:47 PM",Pranathi, Lololol
20523,"29/12/18, 10:54:32 PM",Pranathi, Coconut reunion sounds damn stressful

20560,"30/12/18, 11:37:57 PM",Sush, then a woman he considers a 'sister' gets raped and murdered
20561,"30/12/18, 11:38:02 PM",Sush, then he turns it around
20562,"30/12/18, 11:38:27 PM",Pranathi, Ahh of course.

20684,"01/01/19, 8:33:42 AM",Pranathi, I think I want peace of mind. Being able to let small things go
20685,"01/01/19, 8:34:00 AM",Pranathi, To not feel as easily swayed by small upsets
20686,"01/01/19, 8:34:19 AM",Sush, ❤s to that

20695,"01/01/19, 8:35:45 AM",Pranathi, There aren't that many places here that one can be outdoors without raising suspicion
20696,"01/01/19, 8:36:00 AM",Pranathi, Plus it's too hot most of the time and walking is too difficult with these roads
20697,"01/01/19, 8:35:59 AM",Sush, or without soooo much traffic
20698,"01/01/19, 8:36:04 AM",Sush, i think insti also gave that to us
20699,"01/01/19, 8:36:06 AM",Pranathi, Yeah exactly
20700,"01/01/19, 8:36:10 AM",Sush, so we've taken it for granted a lot
20701,"01/01/19, 8:36:19 AM",Pranathi, Yeah for sure. My therapist pointed it out to me this year
20702,"01/01/19, 8:36:27 AM",Pranathi, That I am happiest in two situations
20703,"01/01/19, 8:36:27 AM",Sush, yeah?
20704,"01/01/19, 8:36:36 AM",Pranathi, Being outdoors or listening to music
20705,"01/01/19, 8:36:43 AM",Sush, 
20706,"01/01/19, 8:36:46 AM",Pranathi, Which is bang on I think

20717,"01/01/19, 8:38:03 AM",Sush, we need to find a one-mode-of-transportation spot between us
20718,"01/01/19, 8:38:17 AM",Pranathi, Yeah no? But I still have forever left here also 
20719,"01/01/19, 8:38:17 AM",Sush, where 6 meets red line types

20864,"02/01/19, 2:02:45 AM",Pranathi, She and I argued today because she got annoyed at my tone. Something I said that sounded rude it seems
20865,"02/01/19, 2:02:51 AM",Pranathi, So she chased me down the hall to make me apologize
20866,"02/01/19, 2:02:55 AM",Sush, Ayyo!
20867,"02/01/19, 2:03:08 AM",Pranathi, It's exhausting being around them all the time
20868,"02/01/19, 2:03:12 AM",Pranathi, And they're all like the opposite of chill
20869,"02/01/19, 2:03:14 AM",Pranathi, Even my brother
20870,"02/01/19, 2:03:21 AM",Pranathi, Being so fucking sanctimonious all the time
20871,"02/01/19, 2:03:32 AM",Sush, So annoying that your brother defended that rando!
20872,"02/01/19, 2:03:52 AM",Pranathi, He's trying to hold me accountable for getting annoyed at some random stranger's condescending questions!
20873,"02/01/19, 2:04:03 AM",Pranathi, Why the fuck does he even care?
20874,"02/01/19, 2:04:24 AM",Sush, Men simply don’t comprehend the irritation of being condescended to all the damn time
20875,"02/01/19, 2:04:34 AM",Pranathi," There's this sentiment in my family that I'm the sort of brash, aggressive, asshole of a human that needs to be chastised for bad behavior"
20876,"02/01/19, 2:04:50 AM",Pranathi," And if it's not bad enough that my parents do it, my brother thinks he can take on the mantle of correcting my behavior"
20877,"02/01/19, 2:04:51 AM",Pranathi, It infuriates me
20878,"02/01/19, 2:05:10 AM",Pranathi, Yeah!! He doesn't know what that feels like because he's probably the one doing the condescending most of the time
20879,"02/01/19, 2:05:54 AM",Sush, Not even unlikely
20880,"02/01/19, 2:06:22 AM",Sush, I don’t know where to draw that line also
20881,"02/01/19, 2:06:57 AM",Pranathi, What line?
20882,"02/01/19, 2:07:03 AM",Pranathi, Yeah he's gotten so uncle
20883,"02/01/19, 2:07:05 AM",Sush, Like sometimes I feel if a social situation is about my parents
20884,"02/01/19, 2:07:28 AM",Sush, Am I supposed to suck it up for them or am I allowed to respond authentically
20885,"02/01/19, 2:09:18 AM",Pranathi, Yeah it's interesting. I don't think I'm allowed to respond authentically tbh
20886,"02/01/19, 2:09:24 AM",Pranathi, It would just drive us too far apart
20887,"02/01/19, 2:09:34 AM",Sush, Yeah idk
20888,"02/01/19, 2:09:45 AM",Sush, With family situations I feel entitled to respond
20889,"02/01/19, 2:09:49 AM",Sush, Because it’s my family
20890,"02/01/19, 2:09:52 AM",Sush, Not theirs also
20891,"02/01/19, 2:09:56 AM",Sush, *theirs alone
20892,"02/01/19, 2:10:43 AM",Sush," and like, we have repeated contact with family"
20893,"02/01/19, 2:11:34 AM",Sush, But these asshole boys get to come and antagonise us repeatedly and walk away happily
20894,"02/01/19, 2:12:07 AM",Pranathi, Yeah true
20895,"02/01/19, 2:12:39 AM",Pranathi, True
20896,"02/01/19, 2:13:03 AM",Pranathi, My brother and I had a conversation last week
20897,"02/01/19, 2:13:10 AM",Pranathi," I can't remember if I told you, but I told him why he was upsetting me"
20898,"02/01/19, 2:13:29 AM",Pranathi," And I had to frame it in a way that didn't offend his ego, and tiptoe around his dumbass masculinity"
20899,"02/01/19, 2:13:38 AM",Pranathi, And he took it okaaay. But it's exhausting to do that work also
20900,"02/01/19, 2:14:27 AM",Pranathi, I want to because I care about him and I don't want him to turn out like every other male moron
20901,"02/01/19, 2:14:42 AM",Sush, Fair
20902,"02/01/19, 2:14:54 AM",Sush, That careful framing is so annoying lol
20903,"02/01/19, 2:15:01 AM",Sush, But glad he took it ok!
20904,"02/01/19, 2:16:16 AM",Pranathi," Yeah. It took some time, but we got there"
20905,"02/01/19, 2:16:26 AM",Pranathi, I can't do this every time he exhibits prototypical male behavior though
20906,"02/01/19, 2:16:30 AM",Pranathi, There aren't enough hours in the day
20907,"02/01/19, 2:16:39 AM",Pranathi, He was mansplaining soooo much to be about Carnatic music
20908,"02/01/19, 2:16:55 AM",Pranathi," Now every time I hear him speak about some kutcheri he went to, I have to walk away for my own sanity and for the sake of my research"
20909,"02/01/19, 2:18:12 AM",Sush, That is exhausting!
20910,"02/01/19, 2:18:43 AM",Sush, I blame my dad like that for anything literally about indian politics triggering mine and my sister’s anxiety
20911,"02/01/19, 2:19:10 AM",Sush, ‘Modi should get leprosy’ is the new refrain
20912,"02/01/19, 2:19:50 AM",Sush, Raafia is sooo late
20913,"02/01/19, 2:20:01 AM",Pranathi, Omg you're still waiting?
20914,"02/01/19, 2:20:03 AM",Pranathi, Ayyooo
20915,"02/01/19, 2:20:06 AM",Sush, Yaaaa
20916,"02/01/19, 2:20:10 AM",Pranathi, Is it a lunch date?
20917,"02/01/19, 2:20:15 AM",Sush, Yep!
20918,"02/01/19, 2:20:17 AM",Pranathi, Modi should get leprosy lolol WHY
20919,"02/01/19, 2:20:20 AM",Pranathi, Why so hateful!
20920,"02/01/19, 2:20:25 AM",Sush, Seriously!
20921,"02/01/19, 2:20:29 AM",Pranathi," Of all things, leprosy that too hahaha"
20922,"02/01/19, 2:20:36 AM",Pranathi, Like that's a very specific curse
20923,"02/01/19, 2:21:04 AM",Sush, Ya!!
20924,"02/01/19, 2:21:11 AM",Sush, My dad is very scared of skin issues
20925,"02/01/19, 2:21:18 AM",Sush, ‘Ayyo sori Varun’s
20926,"02/01/19, 2:21:23 AM",Sush, *varum
20927,"02/01/19, 2:21:24 AM",Sush, Lol
20928,"[02/01/19, 2:21:35 AM",Sush, ‎image omitted
20929,"02/01/19, 2:22:39 AM",Pranathi, Hahahaha
20930,"02/01/19, 2:22:55 AM",Pranathi, Is he also hypochondriac
20931,"02/01/19, 2:24:06 AM",Sush, My sister is
20932,"02/01/19, 2:24:34 AM",Sush, She is convinced her fungal infection is leprosy
20933,"02/01/19, 2:24:43 AM",Sush, This leprosy obsession idk
20934,"02/01/19, 2:24:46 AM",Sush, Both of them
20935,"02/01/19, 2:25:03 AM",Sush, Once one man was begging and he touched her arm
20936,"02/01/19, 2:25:13 AM",Sush, His fingers were malformed or something
20937,"02/01/19, 2:25:20 AM",Sush, She was convinced he gave her leprosy
20938,"02/01/19, 2:25:39 AM",Sush, And came home and bawled
20939,"02/01/19, 2:25:40 AM",Pranathi, Hahaha oh nooooo
20940,"02/01/19, 2:25:48 AM",Pranathi, I would sort of be the same way
20941,"02/01/19, 2:25:50 AM",Pranathi, You know this
20942,"02/01/19, 2:25:59 AM",Sush, I know I told her 😅😅
20943,"02/01/19, 2:26:34 AM",Pranathi," I googled ""how do you get leprosy"""
20944,"02/01/19, 2:26:42 AM",Pranathi," And Google suggested ""how do you get leprosy from an armadillo"""
20945,"02/01/19, 2:26:44 AM",Sush, Nooo😂
20946,"02/01/19, 2:26:46 AM",Sush, Omg
20947,"02/01/19, 2:26:50 AM",Pranathi, Apparently half of the armadillos carry leprosy!
20948,"02/01/19, 2:27:00 AM",Sush, Weird things!
20949,"02/01/19, 2:27:02 AM",Pranathi, Amazonian armadillos jk
20950,"02/01/19, 2:27:10 AM",Pranathi, Guess which animal I'm avoiding
20951,"02/01/19, 2:27:17 AM",Sush, 😂😂
20952,"02/01/19, 2:27:17 AM",Pranathi, This is why it is best to avoid unknown animals I feel
20953,"02/01/19, 2:27:20 AM",Pranathi, And known animals also
20954,"02/01/19, 2:27:31 AM",Sush, Correct just all animals
20955,"02/01/19, 2:27:52 AM",Pranathi, she has arrived?
20956,"02/01/19, 2:28:02 AM",Sush, No🤬
20957,"02/01/19, 2:29:24 AM",Pranathi, Ayyyoo
20958,"02/01/19, 2:29:30 AM",Pranathi, You were supposed to meet at 1
20959,"02/01/19, 2:30:22 AM",Sush, Yeah!
20960,"02/01/19, 2:30:49 AM",Pranathi, Uh oh did she text saying she's on her way?
20961,"02/01/19, 2:31:05 AM",Sush, Ya child care delays
20962,"02/01/19, 2:32:53 AM",Sush, What is this full tablet menu trend
20963,"02/01/19, 2:33:41 AM",Pranathi, I just snuck into this kitchen and ate a kaju katli
20964,"02/01/19, 2:33:43 AM",Pranathi, What tablet?
20965,"02/01/19, 2:33:49 AM",Pranathi, Like ipad level situation?
20966,"02/01/19, 2:34:39 AM",Pranathi, OMG
20967,"02/01/19, 2:34:45 AM",Pranathi, Damini Gandham married Ninad Shahane?!
20968,"02/01/19, 2:34:50 AM",Pranathi, HOW?!
20969,"02/01/19, 4:06:26 AM",Sush, WhaAat
20970,"02/01/19, 4:06:31 AM",Sush, Sorry
20971,"02/01/19, 4:06:58 AM",Sush, Raafia and baby arrived
20972,"02/01/19, 4:07:11 AM",Sush, who is Ninad shahane???
20973,"02/01/19, 4:08:05 AM",Sush, Also the waiter at sigree gave me his phone number on a chit!!!
20974,"02/01/19, 4:08:11 AM",Sush," Like, wtf."
20975,"02/01/19, 4:08:29 AM",Sush, Is it classist of me to see that as v different from piccolo mondo???
20976,"02/01/19, 4:08:42 AM",Sush, But v different culture!!!
20977,"02/01/19, 4:11:22 AM",Sush, Ammu ate a handful of saunf and threw up also🤦🏽‍♀️
20978,"02/01/19, 4:14:47 AM",Sush, Ammu is Raafia’s daughter
20979,"02/01/19, 4:28:26 AM",Pranathi, He is one fellow
20980,"02/01/19, 4:28:39 AM",Pranathi," You google him, or look at Damini's photos on Facebook"
20981,"02/01/19, 4:30:12 AM",Pranathi," And maybe a little, but also not wrong to not feel great about it! Plus with Piccolo Mondo guy you reached out to him first which feels less threatening somehow. Particularly because in this context we've always been socialized to shun unwanted advances from men"
20982,"02/01/19, 4:31:01 AM",Pranathi, Oh noooo hahaha what a silly goose. Do you feel affectionately towards Ammu?
20983,"02/01/19, 4:31:41 AM",Sush, that's true!
20984,"02/01/19, 4:32:22 AM",Sush, will go home and google!
20985,"02/01/19, 4:33:23 AM",Sush, i felt very irritated by it
20986,"02/01/19, 4:33:30 AM",Sush, i didn't say thank you while leaving
20987,"02/01/19, 4:35:02 AM",Pranathi, Naturally. There's something off putting about it when you have to continue to be around him also
20988,"02/01/19, 4:35:13 AM",Pranathi, Like I don't want you to serve me after you've hit on me
20989,"02/01/19, 4:35:15 AM",Pranathi, How awkward
20990,"02/01/19, 4:36:15 AM",Sush, yaaa!
20991,"02/01/19, 8:38:07 AM",Pranathi, I'm at one place called Pumpkin Tales in Alwarpet
20992,"02/01/19, 8:38:19 AM",Pranathi, It is so fancy
20993,"02/01/19, 8:38:29 AM",Pranathi, Chennai has so so many new places to eat at
20994,"03/01/19, 12:27:17 AM",Pranathi, ‎Missed voice call
20995,"03/01/19, 4:57:24 AM",Pranathi, ‎Missed voice call
20996,"03/01/19, 5:30:58 AM",Pranathi, Hi hi
20997,"03/01/19, 5:31:36 AM",Pranathi," I called because I wanted to check in about Hyderabad plans. I'm starting to schedule interviews plus there are some events I can't miss, so I wanted to ask if you're still up for it, whether I should book tickets etc."
20998,"03/01/19, 5:34:19 AM",Sush, Helloo! I’ll call in twenty?
20999,"03/01/19, 5:34:39 AM",Pranathi, Okay. I'll be leaving soon after for a kutcheri so I won't be able to talk for long!
21000,"03/01/19, 5:34:45 AM",Pranathi," But yes, 20 sounds good"
21001,"03/01/19, 5:34:46 AM",Pranathi, 
21002,"03/01/19, 5:34:49 AM",Sush, 💕😘
21003,"03/01/19, 5:34:59 AM",Pranathi, ❤
21004,"03/01/19, 5:51:48 AM",Sush, Friend
21005,"03/01/19, 5:51:56 AM",Sush, Would Pongal time work for you?
21006,"03/01/19, 5:51:57 AM",Pranathi, Yesss
21007,"03/01/19, 5:52:13 AM",Sush, I’m going to thanjavur for a day and working from home this week 😭😭
21008,"03/01/19, 5:52:39 AM",Sush, But Pongal time my cousin will be there as well - he’s great but we won’t have as much alone time 
21009,"03/01/19, 5:53:03 AM",Sush, This trip has been so chaotic - im sorry I’ve been so bad with planning!
21010,"03/01/19, 5:53:07 AM",Pranathi, I think I will have to be here for Pongal. 
21011,"03/01/19, 5:53:27 AM",Pranathi, It's the first time I've been here since I've left no?
21012,"03/01/19, 5:53:54 AM",Sush, Makes sense that’s why I didn’t ask before examining every other date 🤦🏽‍♀️
21013,"03/01/19, 5:53:59 AM",Pranathi," So I think parents will get senti if I go away for Pongal. Especially with puja and visitors at home to the koil and all, I think they'll appreciate the help"
21014,"03/01/19, 5:54:14 AM",Sush, Fair fair
21015,"03/01/19, 5:54:14 AM",Pranathi, Maybe we wait till Chicago then? ❤
21016,"03/01/19, 5:54:19 AM",Pranathi, I understand this trip has been chaotic!
21017,"03/01/19, 5:54:23 AM",Sush, Uuuugh I miss you so much tho
21018,"03/01/19, 5:54:25 AM",Pranathi, And I don't want to be another claimant on your time
21019,"03/01/19, 5:54:35 AM",Pranathi, Esp since you have such limited time here with family
21020,"03/01/19, 5:54:38 AM",Sush, I feel irritated that I had to hang with randos in Hyd instead of you
21021,"03/01/19, 5:54:41 AM",Pranathi, I miss you tooooo
21022,"03/01/19, 5:54:48 AM",Pranathi, Soooooo much

21049,"03/01/19, 5:58:42 AM",Sush, Ugh

21253,"08/01/19, 2:24:16 AM",Pranathi, So it sounds so stuffy and pretentious with a bunch of random semi-colons
21254,"08/01/19, 2:25:11 AM",Pranathi," Also he included a bunch of random floofy anthro sounding words like ""spatio-temporal assemblages"" which mean NOTHING."
21255,"08/01/19, 2:25:30 AM",Pranathi," He used the word ""intersubstitutable"" over and over again"

21497,"12/01/19, 8:06:12 AM",Pranathi," Yeah we all had to do a treatment. One lotion, left it on overnight and all took bath today. Had to wash our sheets and clothes in hot water"
21498,"12/01/19, 8:06:21 AM",Sush, 😂 paavam!
21499,"12/01/19, 8:06:23 AM",Pranathi, And iron everything we wear
21500,"12/01/19, 8:06:31 AM",Pranathi, Stop laughing!
21501,"12/01/19, 8:06:47 AM",Sush, omg to kill poochis with heat?
21502,"12/01/19, 8:07:03 AM",Pranathi, It's actually really stressful for everyone. Mom has so much work to do
21503,"12/01/19, 8:07:15 AM",Pranathi, Yeah
21504,"12/01/19, 8:07:16 AM",Sush, I can imagine!
21505,"12/01/19, 8:07:27 AM",Sush, And general feeling of creepy crawleies no
21506,"12/01/19, 8:07:32 AM",Sush, Crawlies
21507,"12/01/19, 8:07:36 AM",Pranathi, Yeah it's really gross
21508,"12/01/19, 8:07:51 AM",Pranathi, And you won't know for 4 weeks if you have contracted it
21509,"12/01/19, 8:07:55 AM",Pranathi, Because it takes 4 weeks to show up
21510,"12/01/19, 8:09:17 AM",Sush, Oh man!!
21511,"12/01/19, 8:12:46 AM",Sush," Sorry, at doc"
21512,"12/01/19, 8:13:25 AM",Pranathi," No worries! Take care, Ashwin!"
21513,"12/01/19, 8:22:01 AM",Sush, All done!
21514,"12/01/19, 8:22:05 AM",Sush, Who is doctor you know
21515,"12/01/19, 8:22:12 AM",Sush, Remember SOS?
21516,"12/01/19, 8:22:14 AM",Sush, His mom
21517,"12/01/19, 8:22:21 AM",Pranathi, Ohhh
21518,"12/01/19, 8:22:25 AM",Pranathi, Very nice!
21519,"12/01/19, 8:22:28 AM",Sush, Ya they are our neighbours
21520,"12/01/19, 8:22:37 AM",Sush, My family used to rent their family home
21521,"12/01/19, 8:22:36 AM",Pranathi, Yeah I remember you telling me
21522,"12/01/19, 8:22:42 AM",Sush, Before I was born
21523,"12/01/19, 8:24:07 AM",Pranathi, How's your sister doing?
21524,"12/01/19, 8:52:08 AM",Sush, She’s happy now
21525,"12/01/19, 8:52:15 AM",Sush, Both rabies and tetanus done
21526,"12/01/19, 8:52:26 AM",Sush, Going to pick up my cousin now
21527,"12/01/19, 8:52:32 AM",Sush, His parents are sulking N
21528,"12/01/19, 9:01:04 AM",Pranathi, Haha good good
21529,"12/01/19, 9:01:21 AM",Pranathi, Oh no they're still sulking ah
21530,"13/01/19, 1:45:28 AM",Sush, Ya
21531,"13/01/19, 1:45:38 AM",Sush, I think they can tell we fibbed
21532,"13/01/19, 1:45:45 AM",Sush, Idk it all got v complicated
21533,"13/01/19, 1:45:53 AM",Sush, My cousin seems perfectly fine though
21534,"13/01/19, 1:46:09 AM",Sush, and I guess that’s the relationship I really care about
21535,"13/01/19, 1:46:12 AM",Sush, But mom is upset
21536,"13/01/19, 1:46:16 AM",Sush, How are you?
21537,"13/01/19, 1:47:07 AM",Pranathi, Ugh that sounds very messy!!
21538,"13/01/19, 1:47:31 AM",Pranathi," I hope they eventually get over it, but it sucks your mom is upset. "
21539,"13/01/19, 1:47:38 AM",Pranathi, How's your dad?
21540,"13/01/19, 1:47:49 AM",Sush, Yeah 
21541,"13/01/19, 1:47:58 AM",Sush, You think I was selfish?
21542,"13/01/19, 1:48:24 AM",Sush, Old people are saying they want to come visit me and I turned them away
21543,"13/01/19, 1:49:23 AM",Pranathi, Btw remember that book we saw? Daughters of the Sun by Ira Mukhoty about Mughal royal women? I'm at a panel and she's saying very interesting things!
21544,"13/01/19, 1:49:37 AM",Pranathi, No I don't think you were selfish at all
21545,"13/01/19, 1:49:44 AM",Sush, Oooh yes! Did you get the book?
21546,"13/01/19, 1:49:50 AM",Pranathi, You're not selfish to want to be around your immediate family
21547,"13/01/19, 1:49:59 AM",Pranathi, I am going to get the book!
21548,"13/01/19, 1:50:18 AM",Sush, V cool!
21549,"13/01/19, 1:50:32 AM",Pranathi," And maybe the lying is just complicated, but that was also to spare their feelings. So don't feel too guilty!"
21550,"13/01/19, 1:50:50 AM",Sush, I think they kinda saw through it
21551,"13/01/19, 1:51:03 AM",Sush, Because they came home that day and no one was there
21552,"13/01/19, 1:51:14 AM",Sush, and now also my parents are saying dumb lies
21553,"13/01/19, 1:51:16 AM",Sush, Ugh
21554,"13/01/19, 1:51:26 AM",Sush, I’m also resentful that I’m losing time to this!
21555,"13/01/19, 1:52:34 AM",Pranathi, Oh noooo. Maybe that day you should've asked Sneha to come lol
21556,"13/01/19, 1:53:18 AM",Pranathi, Yeah I guess now it's too late to take back the lie also 
21557,"13/01/19, 1:53:54 AM",Pranathi, Don't be too sad lovebug. You can't keep everyone happy also
21558,"13/01/19, 2:17:18 AM",Sush, Lol yaa
21559,"13/01/19, 2:17:30 AM",Sush, I think mom is also slightly resentful
21560,"13/01/19, 2:17:34 AM",Sush, Which annoys me a bit
21561,"13/01/19, 2:17:47 AM",Sush, Like she’s saying ammo akka would have thrown a tantrum
21562,"13/01/19, 2:18:06 AM",Sush, Which completes erases the way my uncle treats my sister
21563,"13/01/19, 2:18:30 AM",Sush, that’s not fair no?
21564,"13/01/19, 2:18:54 AM",Sush, It’s gaslighting to say you will throw tantrum if a person who actively causes you harm continues to cause you harm
21565,"13/01/19, 8:24:42 AM",Pranathi, Yeah it's definitely not fair 
21566,"13/01/19, 8:24:45 AM",Pranathi, That breaks my heart
21567,"13/01/19, 8:25:25 AM",Pranathi, I think maybe your mom doesn't want to acknowledge it because then it would bring up all the guilt and worry and anger that she probably can't deal with retrospectively
21568,"13/01/19, 8:25:37 AM",Pranathi, It would be world view shattering for her to see people in her own family that way
21569,"13/01/19, 8:25:50 AM",Pranathi, But I totally get your annoyance too.
21570,"13/01/19, 8:25:55 AM",Pranathi, Sorry for the late response
21571,"13/01/19, 8:26:01 AM",Pranathi, I was roaming around at the Mylapore festival

21727,"17/01/19, 10:50:04 AM",Pranathi, Awww 
21728,"17/01/19, 10:50:07 AM",Pranathi, I'm sorry booboo
21729,"17/01/19, 10:50:14 AM",Pranathi, I wish I could make it better
21730,"17/01/19, 10:50:23 AM",Sush, 
21731,"17/01/19, 10:50:25 AM",Sush, How are you
21732,"17/01/19, 10:50:36 AM",Sush, I drank kashayam
21733,"17/01/19, 10:50:39 AM",Pranathi, I had an awful meeting today
21734,"17/01/19, 10:50:51 AM",Pranathi, And I am very sick
21735,"17/01/19, 10:50:54 AM",Pranathi, So I am also feeling pretty awful
21736,"17/01/19, 10:51:03 AM",Sush, Ohmygosh! What happened?
21737,"17/01/19, 10:52:07 AM",Pranathi, This guy who's a Tamil Muslim filmmaker
21738,"17/01/19, 10:52:21 AM",Pranathi, He basically told me I need to unlearn all my Brahminness if I can even hope to do this research on gaana
21739,"17/01/19, 10:52:30 AM",Pranathi," He told me I need to change the way I speak, and he said it's a pity I'm fair, because it'll give me away."
21740,"17/01/19, 10:52:38 AM",Pranathi," He also gave me a bunch of ""tips"" like ""dress more modestly"". (I was wearing pants and a shirt today to go to Amethyst.)"
21741,"17/01/19, 10:52:57 AM",Pranathi," He gave me ""primers"" like ""don't say 'avaa', say 'avanga'."" As though I don't know..."
21742,"17/01/19, 10:53:17 AM",Pranathi," And basically made a lot of assumptions about how I would act... And told me I should expect people to treat me like ""a Brahmin bitch""."
21743,"17/01/19, 10:53:45 AM",Pranathi, And that I should ask for forgiveness where possible...
21744,"17/01/19, 11:00:31 AM",Sush, Oh my god!
21745,"17/01/19, 11:00:35 AM",Sush, That sounds awful!!!
21746,"17/01/19, 11:00:43 AM",Sush, I’m so sorry you had to listen to all that!
21747,"17/01/19, 11:01:03 AM",Sush, Wtf
21748,"17/01/19, 11:01:08 AM",Pranathi, It feels really discouraging and painful
21749,"17/01/19, 11:01:15 AM",Pranathi, I try to be as reflexive as possible
21750,"17/01/19, 11:01:20 AM",Pranathi, And I think seriously about my positionality
21751,"17/01/19, 11:01:35 AM",Pranathi, I'm trying to make sure I don't rub anyone the wrong way or be oblivious to my privilege
21752,"17/01/19, 11:01:45 AM",Pranathi," But I honestly don't know if ""asking for forgiveness"" is the way to go forward"
21753,"17/01/19, 11:02:18 AM",Sush, It’s almost like he’s asking you be self loathing
21754,"17/01/19, 11:02:21 AM",Sush, No need uncle
21755,"17/01/19, 11:14:53 AM",Pranathi, Yeah exactly
21756,"17/01/19, 11:14:58 AM",Pranathi, And it's also disingenuous
21757,"17/01/19, 11:15:01 AM",Pranathi, Anyway...
21758,"17/01/19, 11:15:14 AM",Pranathi, How are you making the most of your time at home?
21759,"17/01/19, 11:15:21 AM",Pranathi, Two more hours till you take off or until you leave home?
21760,"17/01/19, 1:53:02 PM",Sush, Hi love
21761,"17/01/19, 1:53:14 PM",Sush," Sorry, was with fam"

21776,"17/01/19, 11:38:24 PM",Sush, I’m hating them all slightly as I walk past
21777,"17/01/19, 11:38:28 PM",Pranathi, Although I could do without the envy and scorn of economy passengers as they traipse past to get to their shitty seats
21778,"17/01/19, 11:38:34 PM",Sush, Looool

22489,"22/02/19, 8:43:28 AM",Pranathi," So it's not a meniscus tear, but it is a ""moderate"" ligament sprain. It's not bad enough to require surgery, but it is distressed enough to mean I have to wear this brace for another two weeks at least. I can go out and stuff, but I shouldn't walk around too much and put pressure on my knee."
22490,"22/02/19, 3:25:55 PM",Sush, Paavam!!

22493,"22/02/19, 8:25:32 PM",Pranathi, More of an annoyance that I have to wear this brace for two weeks. It severely hampers movement

23018,"11/03/19, 12:47:52 PM",Sush, Cute!!
23019,"11/03/19, 12:48:32 PM",Sush, I’m feeling even more averse to being around men than usual lol
23020,"11/03/19, 12:49:11 PM",Pranathi, Hahaha why?
23021,"11/03/19, 12:50:23 PM",Sush, Just I think

23023,"11/03/19, 12:50:42 PM",Sush, 😂
23024,"11/03/19, 12:50:44 PM",Pranathi, What are they even useful for
23025,"11/03/19, 12:50:54 PM",Sush, Probably need to go to therapy for this but anyway
23026,"11/03/19, 12:50:56 PM",Pranathi, This T annoyed me slightly yesterday
23027,"11/03/19, 12:51:06 PM",Sush, enduku?
23028,"11/03/19, 12:51:54 PM",Pranathi, He was acting so stressed out thinking his friends know or have guessed or something. And I was just a little annoyed about the drama
23029,"11/03/19, 12:52:11 PM",Pranathi, Like so what if they know? I mean what could they know? It's not like we've done anything more than talk
23030,"11/03/19, 12:52:32 PM",Sush, fair! Not like there’s anything major for other people to know also - you’re just talking no
23031,"11/03/19, 12:52:47 PM",Pranathi," And he kept saying oh I don't want them to know, what if they say something about you and that makes me feel weird about meeting you"
23032,"11/03/19, 12:53:11 PM",Pranathi," That was weird because I was like hmm, what is a dealbreaker? And why do you care what people I haven't met in ten years since school would have to say about me"
23033,"11/03/19, 12:53:57 PM",Sush, Correct
23034,"11/03/19, 12:54:11 PM",Sush, What if someone says pranathisux u decide no
23035,"11/03/19, 12:56:23 PM",Pranathi, Yeah
23036,"11/03/19, 12:56:50 PM",Pranathi, I don't want to be flirting with someone who is so easily swayed by some gossip about me anyway lol
23037,"11/03/19, 12:57:02 PM",Pranathi, Also he was being so patronizing about me going to Vyasarpadi
23038,"11/03/19, 12:57:37 PM",Pranathi," I said I'm going to meet one guy, and he didn't stop at saying be safe, which itself was disproved soooo much because this guy I met there and his family were so so lovely to me"
23039,"11/03/19, 12:57:55 PM",Pranathi, But even with the warning he could've stopped. He *wanted* me to take pepper spray or some guy with me
23040,"11/03/19, 12:58:05 PM",Pranathi, And I just didn't want to hear random advice on how to do my research
23041,"11/03/19, 12:58:12 PM",Sush, Wtf
23042,"11/03/19, 12:58:20 PM",Sush, That’s irritating
23043,"11/03/19, 1:00:33 PM",Sush, like do guys think we haven’t already thought of this???
23044,"11/03/19, 1:01:14 PM",Pranathi, Yah I've told him that I've done research in Pulianthope and I know how to handle myself
23045,"11/03/19, 1:01:35 PM",Pranathi," And he was like, I know but just be careful. You don't know how they'll see you or what they could do"
23046,"11/03/19, 1:02:20 PM",Pranathi," I said I don't like walking around the world thinking people are going to attack me in broad daylight. Especially because he was like oh, North Madras you have to be careful"
23047,"11/03/19, 1:02:33 PM",Pranathi, It's so casteist and classist
23048,"11/03/19, 1:03:25 PM",Sush, 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️
23049,"11/03/19, 1:03:55 PM",Pranathi, Sorry I'm randomly ranting
23050,"11/03/19, 1:04:14 PM",Pranathi, Are you going to Bourbon Street?
23051,"11/03/19, 1:04:25 PM",Sush, No I’d feel annoyed also
23052,"11/03/19, 1:04:38 PM",Sush, I might give that a miss tbh
23053,"11/03/19, 1:04:58 PM",Sush, sounds too party party for me lol
23054,"11/03/19, 1:05:08 PM",Sush, I’ll go to Frenchman street
23055,"11/03/19, 1:05:23 PM",Sush, Which sounds a lot more low-key and chill!
23056,"11/03/19, 1:10:04 PM",Sush, I’ll call?
23057,"11/03/19, 1:10:14 PM",Sush, you sound off all ok?
23058,"11/03/19, 1:10:16 PM",Pranathi, Oooh
23059,"11/03/19, 1:10:21 PM",Pranathi," I just got home, sorry!"
23060,"11/03/19, 1:10:29 PM",Pranathi, My dad was randomly blabbering something
23061,"11/03/19, 1:10:33 PM",Pranathi, So I was pretending to listen
23062,"11/03/19, 1:10:36 PM",Pranathi, I am fine only

24046,"07/04/19, 10:18:50 PM",Pranathi, Hahahah
24047,"07/04/19, 10:18:50 PM",Sush, We talked about God for like an hour
24048,"07/04/19, 10:18:55 PM",Pranathi, Hence my reaction earlier
24049,"07/04/19, 10:19:02 PM",Pranathi," Oh wow, and?"
24050,"07/04/19, 10:19:25 PM",Sush, lol it’s too much 😭
24051,"07/04/19, 10:20:01 PM",Sush, He’s p religious
24052,"07/04/19, 10:20:09 PM",Pranathi, I'm sorry 
24053,"07/04/19, 10:20:16 PM",Sush, this catholic guilt + current actions don’t compute
24054,"07/04/19, 10:20:29 PM",Pranathi, Wow yeah I can't imagine having that kind of guilt also
24055,"07/04/19, 10:20:46 PM",Sush, i suddenly heard the word ‘adultery’ in my head and freaked out slightly
24056,"07/04/19, 10:21:00 PM",Sush, I mentioned it to Siddhartha yday when we talked
24057,"07/04/19, 10:21:07 PM",Sush, He was like NOOOOT your problem
24058,"07/04/19, 10:21:13 PM",Sush, Which was nice to hear lol
24059,"07/04/19, 10:21:39 PM",Pranathi, Haha go Siddharth's
24060,"07/04/19, 10:21:42 PM",Pranathi, Siddhartha
24061,"07/04/19, 10:22:17 PM",Pranathi, Yeah I can only imagine how stressful that must be
24062,"07/04/19, 10:22:34 PM",Pranathi, What did you do this evening?
24063,"07/04/19, 10:23:05 PM",Sush, I’ve been working since afternoon
24064,"07/04/19, 10:23:15 PM",Sush, So behind - I was mad distracted this week
24065,"07/04/19, 10:24:39 PM",Pranathi, Oh yeah. Still working?
24066,"07/04/19, 10:24:40 PM",Sush," ‘I really like that ur religious. Educated millennials aren't anymore, and it's made me feel kinda isolated. ‘"
24067,"07/04/19, 10:24:48 PM",Sush, He’s also slightly seeing what he wants to see
24068,"07/04/19, 10:24:51 PM",Sush, Ya still working
24069,"07/04/19, 10:24:56 PM",Sush, What are you doing?
24070,"07/04/19, 10:25:07 PM",Pranathi, Yeah sounds like it
24071,"07/04/19, 10:25:18 PM",Pranathi, Watching Shameless and ate ramen
24072,"07/04/19, 10:25:24 PM",Pranathi, Thatha messaged me
24073,"07/04/19, 10:25:29 PM",Sush, Awesome 👯
24074,"07/04/19, 10:25:30 PM",Sush, Oooh
24075,"07/04/19, 10:25:32 PM",Sush, And?
24076,"07/04/19, 10:25:32 PM",Pranathi, Saying he's confused and doesn't want to fall for me
24077,"07/04/19, 10:25:35 PM",Pranathi, Looool
24078,"07/04/19, 10:25:37 PM",Sush, Omg!
24079,"07/04/19, 10:25:41 PM",Pranathi, And that he wants to protect me
24080,"07/04/19, 10:25:43 PM",Sush, Meet thatha!
24081,"07/04/19, 10:25:45 PM",Sush, Lolol
24082,"07/04/19, 10:25:47 PM",Pranathi, I basically rolled my eyes
24083,"07/04/19, 10:25:53 PM",Pranathi, He doesn't want to meet
24084,"07/04/19, 10:26:05 PM",Pranathi, Because he thinks it'll complicate the situation and he'll fall for me it seems
24085,"07/04/19, 10:26:17 PM",Pranathi, I was like ya ya k whatevs tc bye
24086,"07/04/19, 10:26:22 PM",Sush, How to tell someone don’t worry I’m not falling for u
24087,"07/04/19, 10:26:26 PM",Pranathi, I'm paraphrasing but
24088,"07/04/19, 10:26:37 PM",Pranathi, lol yeah how to say don't be so presumptuous
24089,"07/04/19, 10:26:45 PM",Sush, correct
24090,"07/04/19, 10:27:00 PM",Pranathi, Then Tejas called and said he will come next weekend
24091,"07/04/19, 10:27:04 PM",Pranathi, And I said please don't
24092,"07/04/19, 10:27:09 PM",Pranathi, Or two weekends from now
24093,"07/04/19, 10:27:13 PM",Sush, Omg!!
24094,"07/04/19, 10:27:15 PM",Sush, Why not
24095,"07/04/19, 10:27:21 PM",Sush, It’ll help you figure out no
24096,"07/04/19, 10:27:33 PM",Sush, and then you can chill in sf depending
24097,"07/04/19, 10:27:40 PM",Pranathi, Yeah but I'm worried about him being too intense
24098,"07/04/19, 10:28:02 PM",Sush, I wonder if you’ll feel more in control in your space?
24099,"07/04/19, 10:28:05 PM",Pranathi, Already it seems like this is why he wants to come. He's freaking out about the conversation we had I think
24100,"07/04/19, 10:28:14 PM",Pranathi, Ooh this is true.
24101,"07/04/19, 10:28:31 PM",Sush, but also maybe more obligated?
24102,"07/04/19, 10:28:46 PM",Sush, Engendho he’s come means
24103,"07/04/19, 10:29:03 PM",Pranathi," But next weekend is too close he says. And the weekend after that is maybe Cleveland, but also may not go. Then the weekend after that is the weekend right before I go"
24104,"07/04/19, 10:29:19 PM",Sush, Ohhh fair
24105,"07/04/19, 10:29:30 PM",Pranathi, Yeah. This month is actually really busy with work and I don't know if I have the energy to hang out for two whole days and figure out how I feel and all
24106,"07/04/19, 10:29:44 PM",Sush, That makes a lot of sense
24107,"07/04/19, 10:29:43 PM",Pranathi," Even if I have the time, I feel like this situation is so so so much energy"
24108,"07/04/19, 10:30:01 PM",Sush, plus if it’s at his space you can LEAVE
24109,"07/04/19, 10:30:15 PM",Sush, but you can’t kick him out if things don’t go well
24110,"07/04/19, 10:30:25 PM",Pranathi, He called this evening and he was just so annoyingly upbeat and I've been feeling massive Monday blues. So I had to tell him I'll talk tomorrow and I might just need this evening to be quiet and chill
24111,"07/04/19, 10:30:43 PM",Pranathi," And he goes ""But I have 30 mins free now"""
24112,"07/04/19, 10:30:54 PM",Sush, ayyo why he’s not hearing u
24113,"07/04/19, 10:30:56 PM",Pranathi, Yeah exactly
24114,"07/04/19, 10:31:13 PM",Pranathi, Then he sent me pictures of puppies to cheer me up and said he'd send some every hour
24115,"07/04/19, 10:31:21 PM",Sush, omg
24116,"07/04/19, 10:31:26 PM",Sush, has he literally met u
24117,"07/04/19, 10:31:32 PM",Pranathi," He said you don't have to apologize for not responding, but he wants to cheer me up"
24118,"07/04/19, 10:31:40 PM",Pranathi, Literally no
24119,"07/04/19, 10:31:48 PM",Sush, 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️
24120,"07/04/19, 10:31:50 PM",Pranathi, He has no clue who I am tho
24121,"07/04/19, 10:32:07 PM",Pranathi, And doesn't give a shit what I'm literally going on about
24122,"07/04/19, 10:32:17 PM",Pranathi, 🤷🏽‍♀
24123,"07/04/19, 10:32:27 PM",Sush, Ayyo 
24124,"07/04/19, 10:32:49 PM",Pranathi, I think I just have to deescalate so that I don't feel annoyed when I meet him
24125,"07/04/19, 10:33:09 PM",Pranathi," I think this talking less, like maybe once every couple days instead of every couple of hours"
24126,"07/04/19, 10:33:13 PM",Pranathi, Might be one way
24127,"07/04/19, 10:33:22 PM",Sush, correct
24128,"07/04/19, 10:33:32 PM",Pranathi," Anyway, I haz to sleep soon and men are so bore"
24129,"07/04/19, 10:33:38 PM",Sush, like give me a chance to seek u out
24130,"07/04/19, 10:33:49 PM",Pranathi, Yeah let me miss you a little
24131,"07/04/19, 10:33:53 PM",Sush, They’re terrible 
24132,"07/04/19, 10:33:58 PM",Pranathi, Truly
24133,"07/04/19, 10:34:05 PM",Pranathi, You sleeping soon?
24134,"07/04/19, 10:34:19 PM",Sush, No I think I’ll work some more
24135,"07/04/19, 10:34:25 PM",Sush, Feelings anxious
24136,"07/04/19, 10:34:33 PM",Pranathi, About work?
24137,"07/04/19, 10:34:47 PM",Sush, Ya slightly
24138,"07/04/19, 10:34:52 PM",Sush, I slacked off a looot last week
24139,"07/04/19, 10:35:19 PM",Pranathi," It's okay, everyone has off weeks, I'm sure Andy will understand"
24140,"07/04/19, 10:35:26 PM",Sush, and the nature of these things is like someone needs my outputs next week
24141,"07/04/19, 10:35:28 PM",Pranathi, Especially since you worked today
24142,"07/04/19, 10:35:47 PM",Sush, Ya but he doesn’t know that haha he will just see unfinished tasks from last week
24143,"07/04/19, 10:35:56 PM",Pranathi, Ugh that sounds stressful
24144,"07/04/19, 10:36:28 PM",Pranathi," But I have confidence in yew, and let me know if you want to do a work date at any point"
24145,"07/04/19, 10:36:31 PM",Sush, I mean it’s ok I really did slack off a lot and I’m lucky I can catch up - a lot of jobs have shorter turnaround times
24146,"07/04/19, 10:36:42 PM",Pranathi, I also feel very stressed about the stuff I have to do this month
24147,"07/04/19, 10:36:45 PM",Sush, Yes 💕💕 next week?
24148,"07/04/19, 10:36:57 PM",Pranathi, Yussss 💕💕
24149,"07/04/19, 10:37:01 PM",Sush, I have meetings nearly every day this week
24150,"07/04/19, 10:37:37 PM",Pranathi, Ugh so many meetings

24162,"07/04/19, 10:38:50 PM",Sush, In a way it’s good I’m not going
24163,"07/04/19, 10:38:57 PM",Sush, I think we’ll be too obvious rn
24164,"07/04/19, 10:39:05 PM",Sush, Possible Tuesday afternoon
24165,"07/04/19, 10:39:12 PM",Sush, He is so free at his job lol

24175,"07/04/19, 10:40:20 PM",Pranathi," Thank you, and good luck to you too! Have a great week ahead love"
24176,"07/04/19, 10:40:31 PM",Sush, 😘😘
24177,"07/04/19, 10:40:33 PM",Pranathi, 🌸🌺🍃
24178,"08/04/19, 11:38:35 AM",Sush, 'it was amazing to see Pranathi also! she’s really grown into herself over doing fieldwork in the last few months and is so so brave and forthright and aware knowledgable of herself and her work!!'
24179,"08/04/19, 12:31:32 PM",Pranathi, Awwww
24180,"08/04/19, 12:31:36 PM",Pranathi, Who is thissssss
24181,"08/04/19, 12:31:39 PM",Pranathi, Oviya?
24182,"08/04/19, 12:31:50 PM",Sush, udayyy
24183,"08/04/19, 12:32:04 PM",Pranathi, Ohhhh yeah he was very happy to talk yesterday
24184,"08/04/19, 12:32:12 PM",Pranathi, I also felt hearts!
24185,"08/04/19, 12:32:17 PM",Sush, cutiessss
24186,"08/04/19, 12:32:31 PM",Pranathi, Free to talk?
24187,"08/04/19, 12:32:51 PM",Sush, in 2 mins?
24188,"08/04/19, 12:32:55 PM",Pranathi, Yessss
24189,"08/04/19, 12:32:58 PM",Sush, going to heat up lunch
24190,"08/04/19, 12:33:23 PM",Pranathi, I am walking to Roti for lunch
24191,"08/04/19, 12:33:39 PM",Sush, UGH TAKE ME BACK TO HP
24192,"08/04/19, 3:38:38 PM",Sush, all ok friend?
24193,"08/04/19, 3:38:44 PM",Sush, i figured your phone died
24194,"08/04/19, 3:38:51 PM",Sush, but slightly worried now
24195,"[08/04/19, 7:22:14 PM",Pranathi, ‎image omitted
24196,"08/04/19, 8:19:33 PM",Pranathi, ‎Missed voice call
24197,"08/04/19, 8:20:31 PM",Pranathi, Hi! Are you able to reach me? I feel like my phone is being weird
24198,"09/04/19, 1:11:14 PM",Sush," Hey, I was thinking about our conversation and I can't stop feeling annoyed. You could've stopped with saying you're disillusioned about marriage relationships men or whatever. I don't care about discussing the institution of marriage and I'm perfectly capable of critical thinking about my choices without needing to discuss it with you.  Honestly no one makes me have a conversation like this on their terms. "
24203,"09/04/19, 1:11:22 PM",Sush, Oviya
24204,"09/04/19, 1:11:37 PM",Sush, Sorry should have led with that
24205,"09/04/19, 1:11:48 PM",Pranathi, Oh shit
24206,"09/04/19, 1:11:51 PM",Pranathi, I thought you were saying this to me
24207,"09/04/19, 1:12:07 PM",Pranathi, And I felt my stomach clench with panic because I couldn't remember this conversation
24208,"[09/04/19, 1:35:59 PM",Sush, ‎image omitted
24209,"09/04/19, 1:42:48 PM",Pranathi, Hahaha yeah exactly
24210,"09/04/19, 1:42:58 PM",Pranathi, The devil is definitely waiting to pounce
24211,"09/04/19, 1:44:29 PM",Sush, Like what is this 
24212,"09/04/19, 1:44:38 PM",Pranathi, Too fucking much
24213,"09/04/19, 1:44:54 PM",Sush, What is honestly no one makes me have a conversation like this on their terms
24214,"09/04/19, 1:45:37 PM",Pranathi, What does that even mean?!
24215,"09/04/19, 1:45:43 PM",Sush, I have no clue
24216,"09/04/19, 1:45:49 PM",Pranathi, I don't understand what she's saying only
24217,"09/04/19, 1:45:54 PM",Pranathi, I'm so confused by what she's mad at exactly
24218,"09/04/19, 1:47:23 PM",Sush, I bet she and cheth and are talking about how terrible I am
24219,"09/04/19, 1:48:02 PM",Pranathi," Don't let it bother you, even though that seems like a silly thing to say"
24220,"09/04/19, 1:48:03 PM",Pranathi, It is bothering you
24221,"09/04/19, 1:48:18 PM",Pranathi," But also, that's probably why she's being this way in the first place"
24222,"09/04/19, 1:48:31 PM",Pranathi, Her opinion of you will never be unfiltered of Chet's opinion of you
24223,"09/04/19, 1:48:37 PM",Sush, Am I such a toxic person???
24224,"09/04/19, 1:48:42 PM",Pranathi, NO
24225,"09/04/19, 1:48:55 PM",Sush, do you feel like I push my viewpoint down your throat?
24226,"09/04/19, 1:48:57 PM",Pranathi, Stop letting how people who don't have your best intentions at heart define your sense of self
24227,"09/04/19, 1:49:35 PM",Pranathi, Hardly. I think we're both as capable of saying what we want without taking offense if the other were to disagree
24228,"09/04/19, 1:50:08 PM",Pranathi," And I imagine Oviya is too, especially with her line of work. People probably state their opinions emphatically to her all the time, so I don't know why she's targeting her own friend for saying something about her own life"
24229,"09/04/19, 1:50:36 PM",Sush, what is you knew enough to say something seemingly self aware
24230,"09/04/19, 1:50:54 PM",Sush, And what I’m hearing from this is - leave me alone bitch don’t need u in my life
24231,"09/04/19, 1:53:06 PM",Pranathi," Yeah, so pay  heed and run the fuck away"
24232,"09/04/19, 1:53:14 PM",Pranathi, You don't need someone who's literally shouting at you like that
24233,"09/04/19, 1:53:20 PM",Pranathi, It's dehumanizing and has so little to do with you
24234,"09/04/19, 1:53:38 PM",Pranathi, She's reacting as though she's hurt for something that I can't really understand why she's mad at
24235,"09/04/19, 1:53:55 PM",Pranathi," Weird sentence construction, sorry. Trying to write my special field and I hate academic writing"
24236,"09/04/19, 1:54:21 PM",Sush, More than hurt she’s talking to me like she’s disgusted with who I am and everything I’m about
24237,"09/04/19, 2:16:00 PM",Pranathi, She has to do that in order to believe that she's justified in speaking to you this way
24238,"09/04/19, 7:30:57 PM",Sush," Hey, I was not talking critically about any institutions or attempting to have an intellectually neutral conversation - I was in a vulnerable place, hurting and confused, and talked about how I was feeling. I felt like ranting about wtf are men and why can’t they ever keep it in their pants was not very nice to say to someone who’s about to get married, so I said maybe I shouldn’t be talking to you about it - I did not and do not suggest that my disillusionment had anything to do with your choices at all. My disillusionment has nothing to do with your choices and your choices have nothing to do with how I feel about anything."
24239,"09/04/19, 7:31:07 PM",Sush, Sorry this is for oviya
24240,"09/04/19, 7:31:19 PM",Sush, Again I did alarmist text
24241,"09/04/19, 7:32:22 PM",Pranathi, Hahaha
24242,"09/04/19, 7:32:27 PM",Pranathi, Sorry dude my landlord came over
24243,"09/04/19, 7:32:40 PM",Pranathi, My bathtub is leaking so they have to replace it
24244,"09/04/19, 7:33:04 PM",Sush, No worries!
24245,"09/04/19, 7:33:04 PM",Pranathi, The text is very cogent
24246,"09/04/19, 7:33:08 PM",Pranathi, I like it
24247,"09/04/19, 7:33:16 PM",Pranathi, I also like that you didn't try to apologize
24248,"09/04/19, 7:33:34 PM",Pranathi, The clarification is important and necessary tho. Because her attack on you was vitriolic
24249,"09/04/19, 7:34:38 PM",Sush," Clearly, we are no longer in a place to talk about anything that’s actually going on in ourselves. You’ve been saying in many ways (and on twitter) that you want out - I hear you. Message received."
24250,"09/04/19, 7:34:45 PM",Sush, *in our lives
24251,"09/04/19, 7:35:07 PM",Sush, Or is that unnecessary
24252,"09/04/19, 7:35:23 PM",Sush, I want to call out the slytweeting crap
24253,"09/04/19, 7:35:38 PM",Sush, Devil looming over her
24254,"09/04/19, 7:35:52 PM",Pranathi, That feels a bit unnecessary because she might think you're writing that stuff in the first text only because you're upset about the slytweeting
24255,"09/04/19, 7:36:05 PM",Sush, True
24256,"09/04/19, 7:36:12 PM",Sush, But I want to say fuck you
24257,"09/04/19, 7:36:12 PM",Pranathi," Although I don't think that comes across like that to me, I can see how she might ignore your first text"
24258,"09/04/19, 7:36:27 PM",Pranathi, So I would wait for her to respond to that and then tell her to fuck the fuck off
24259,"09/04/19, 7:36:53 PM",Pranathi, Yeah the slytweeting is so passive aggressive
24260,"09/04/19, 7:37:01 PM",Pranathi," But also like, send off both texts"
24261,"09/04/19, 7:37:06 PM",Pranathi, If you just want to be done with her
24262,"09/04/19, 7:37:15 PM",Pranathi, I would just hate if she was like
24264,"09/04/19, 7:37:21 PM",Sush, Yeah
24265,"09/04/19, 7:37:35 PM",Pranathi, Without engaging at all on how her message was totally inappropriate and needlessly aggressive
24266,"09/04/19, 7:38:06 PM",Sush, I’m over being chastised constantly. You’ve been communicating in several ways that I’m not very welcome in your life - I hear you.
24267,"09/04/19, 7:39:26 PM",Pranathi, Yeah perfect
24268,"09/04/19, 7:39:35 PM",Pranathi, I'm sorry you have to send this text even
24269,"09/04/19, 7:39:37 PM",Pranathi, It's so painful
24270,"09/04/19, 7:42:17 PM",Pranathi, Sorry to randomly digress but see this
24271,"09/04/19, 7:42:22 PM",Sush, kya
24272,"[09/04/19, 7:42:46 PM",Pranathi, ‎image omitted

24280,"09/04/19, 7:44:38 PM",Pranathi," But I feel like tweetiquette demands I don't retweet although some academics I respect who follow me would see and that might be the ""smart"" move not that anyone cares ofc but still this is the kind of thing ""successful"" grad students tweet"
24281,"09/04/19, 7:45:01 PM",Sush, Totally retweet it
24282,"09/04/19, 7:45:19 PM",Sush, That’s obnoxious when you retweet 50 things about yourself
24283,"09/04/19, 7:45:29 PM",Sush, One is totally normal and lovely 💕
24284,"09/04/19, 7:46:01 PM",Sush, That tweetiquette is for celebrities
24285,"09/04/19, 7:46:05 PM",Sush, Not ya
24286,"09/04/19, 7:46:07 PM",Sush, *us

24288,"09/04/19, 7:46:33 PM",Pranathi, Will do and thanks for teaching me tweetiquette
24289,"09/04/19, 7:46:38 PM",Pranathi, 🤦🏽‍♀
24290,"09/04/19, 7:47:25 PM",Sush, 💕😘
24291,"09/04/19, 7:48:43 PM",Sush, It’s fairly twisted to decide to attribute the worst imaginable motives to anything I say or do and then go on to chastise me for it. You’re saying I’m not welcome in your life - Im hearing you.
24292,"09/04/19, 7:48:47 PM",Sush, Sorry lol
24293,"09/04/19, 7:48:56 PM",Sush, Multiple iterations of that message #2
24294,"09/04/19, 7:52:31 PM",Sush," It’s fairly twisted actually to decide to attribute the worst imaginable motives to anything I say or do and then go on to chastise me harshly for it. You’re saying I’m not welcome in your life, and you’ve probably been communicating some version of that for a while - and I hear you."
24295,"09/04/19, 7:52:34 PM",Sush, Sent!
24296,"09/04/19, 7:54:26 PM",Sush, should I also play twitter and change my bio to ‘twisted af’

24298,"10/04/19, 9:26:57 AM",Pranathi, I ended up getting konjam blazed and then had no ability to deal with my phone lol
24299,"10/04/19, 9:27:10 AM",Pranathi, Did she reply to you?
24300,"10/04/19, 9:27:28 AM",Pranathi, Twisted like a Twister champion
24301,"10/04/19, 9:27:36 AM",Pranathi, Twisted like the whomping willow
24302,"10/04/19, 9:27:55 AM",Pranathi, So many nice parallels you could make with a twisted af bio haha

24362,"14/04/19, 3:16:28 PM",Sush, hahaha
24363,"14/04/19, 3:16:48 PM",Pranathi, I matched on Tinder with one fellow called Vishruth
24364,"14/04/19, 3:16:54 PM",Pranathi, Who is from Chennai and I've met through Bindu
24365,"14/04/19, 3:17:02 PM",Pranathi, And he's trying to bbb-splain to me

24377,"14/04/19, 3:17:58 PM",Pranathi, What did you think?
24378,"14/04/19, 3:18:07 PM",Pranathi, He seems to annoy me a little but that could just be because he's Tam
24379,"14/04/19, 3:18:10 PM",Sush, he seemed very young
24380,"14/04/19, 3:18:24 PM",Pranathi, I think I am prejudiced against Tam guys
24381,"14/04/19, 3:20:37 PM",Sush, me too i think
24382,"14/04/19, 3:20:52 PM",Sush, idk

24385,"14/04/19, 3:21:40 PM",Pranathi, I know I'm way too cool for him lol he's also explaining to me his entire family history all of a sudden
24386,"14/04/19, 3:21:47 PM",Sush, hahaha
24387,"14/04/19, 3:21:52 PM",Pranathi, I am sometimes shocked at my lack of interest in people and their lives
24388,"14/04/19, 3:21:58 PM",Sush, lolol!
24389,"14/04/19, 3:22:04 PM",Pranathi," Then again, did I ask?"
24390,"14/04/19, 3:22:22 PM",Sush, once u find someone attractive the minutiae of their lives are sooo fascinating lol
24391,"14/04/19, 3:22:38 PM",Pranathi," If not, stop making this sound like jadagam matching"
24392,"14/04/19, 3:22:41 PM",Pranathi," what your appa does, what your thatha did"
24393,"14/04/19, 3:22:47 PM",Pranathi, I knowwww it's been so long since I felt that
24394,"14/04/19, 3:22:56 PM",Pranathi, I think I am broken

24398,"14/04/19, 3:23:17 PM",Pranathi, But I am finding it hard to catch feelings
24399,"14/04/19, 3:23:21 PM",Sush, it just needs to be triggered by someone
24400,"14/04/19, 3:23:41 PM",Pranathi, Where are all the people I might find attractive?
24401,"14/04/19, 3:23:45 PM",Sush, i think catching feelings is a function of two people
24402,"14/04/19, 3:23:49 PM",Pranathi, It's like there's another Twitter they're not telling us about
24403,"14/04/19, 3:23:53 PM",Pranathi, *Tinder
24404,"14/04/19, 3:23:57 PM",Pranathi, Lol
24405,"14/04/19, 3:23:59 PM",Sush," edge property, not a node property"

24410,"14/04/19, 3:24:36 PM",Sush, ya these network analogies are blowing my mind
24411,"14/04/19, 3:24:44 PM",Sush, even 'interesting' is an edge property
24412,"14/04/19, 3:24:57 PM",Sush, no one is interesting or boring by themselves!
24413,"14/04/19, 3:24:59 PM",Sush, or attractive
24414,"14/04/19, 3:25:00 PM",Sush, or fun
24415,"14/04/19, 3:25:02 PM",Sush, or anything lol
24416,"14/04/19, 3:25:09 PM",Pranathi, Yeah correct
24417,"14/04/19, 3:25:23 PM",Pranathi, It is constructed interactionally
24418,"14/04/19, 3:25:33 PM",Sush, yaaaa!
24419,"14/04/19, 3:25:40 PM",Pranathi," Anyway, I just need to touch someone"
24420,"14/04/19, 3:25:45 PM",Pranathi, I miss touching
24421,"14/04/19, 3:25:48 PM",Sush, (riddhima is coming - should i be mad at her? she's bringing ice cream)
24422,"14/04/19, 3:25:52 PM",Sush, that's v fair
24423,"14/04/19, 3:26:18 PM",Pranathi," You react to how she's treating you. If she is being aware of how hurtful that might've been, forgive, otherwise you tell her how you're feeling"
24424,"14/04/19, 3:26:26 PM",Pranathi, I hope she apologizes
24425,"14/04/19, 3:26:37 PM",Sush, correct
24426,"14/04/19, 3:27:28 PM",Pranathi, There is a guy on Tinder who juggles
24427,"14/04/19, 3:27:31 PM",Pranathi, And is a grad student
24428,"14/04/19, 3:27:39 PM",Pranathi, And all his pics are of him juggling
24429,"14/04/19, 3:37:44 PM",Sush, Hahaha
24430,"14/04/19, 3:37:46 PM",Sush, I like that
24431,"9:00 PM, 4/14/2019",Pranathi," Hola, just got home, free the rest of the evening. Let me know when you are free to talk."
24432,"15/04/19, 8:59:00 AM",Sush, omg i can't stand this meghan
24433,"15/04/19, 8:59:43 AM",Pranathi, Who's Meghan?
24434,"15/04/19, 9:24:03 AM",Pranathi, Tejas' text after I told him I'd like to reduce the frequency of our talking
24435,"15/04/19, 9:24:12 AM",Pranathi, Why is he talking like we've been in a five year relationship
24436,"11:43 PM, 4/14/2019",Pranathi, But I am excited to hang out in person and spend time together. I am sure that will be meaningful and interesting and such a relief
24437,"15/04/19, 9:26:03 AM",Pranathi, Also me
24438,"15/04/19, 11:34:37 AM",Sush, Ayyo!
24439,"15/04/19, 11:34:46 AM",Sush, Good you said what you needed to tho
24440,"15/04/19, 11:34:55 AM",Sush, hopefully he'll back down slightly?
24441,"15/04/19, 11:35:37 AM",Pranathi, Hopefully! I think he's very hurt though
24442,"15/04/19, 11:35:45 AM",Pranathi," He was quite curt, understandably, and I think he thinks it's a sign I'm no longer interested"
24443,"15/04/19, 11:35:54 AM",Sush, Ayy 
24444,"15/04/19, 11:36:23 AM",Sush," Paavam, it makes sense but really can't be helped also"
24445,"15/04/19, 11:36:33 AM",Sush, and it's better than leaving him on read
24446,"15/04/19, 11:38:43 AM",Pranathi, Yeah true
24447,"15/04/19, 11:38:49 AM",Pranathi, I hate that feeling of being left on read
24448,"15/04/19, 11:38:54 AM",Pranathi, Not fair to do it to someone else
24449,"15/04/19, 11:39:08 AM",Pranathi," But I tried to be kind, I think. I told him I'm eager to see how it goes when we see each other in person"
24450,"15/04/19, 11:41:37 AM",Sush, That's very reasonable!
24451,"15/04/19, 11:51:16 AM",Pranathi, I matched with someone on Bumble who is so hot

24461,"15/04/19, 11:52:54 AM",Pranathi," Also built like he is, he'll probably laugh if I can't get the ball over the net. Which I def won't be able to do"
24462,"15/04/19, 11:53:11 AM",Sush, hahaha fairrr i'd worry about that too

24472,"15/04/19, 11:56:36 AM",Sush, like DON'T
24473,"15/04/19, 11:56:41 AM",Sush, it felt a bit hurtful
24474,"15/04/19, 11:56:59 AM",Pranathi, Soooo hurtful
24475,"15/04/19, 11:57:14 AM",Pranathi, Like it hurts to be in touch with someone you're trying to get over
24476,"15/04/19, 11:57:18 AM",Pranathi, But I guess he's also hurting
24477,"15/04/19, 11:57:37 AM",Sush, this makes him looks like he's not!
24478,"15/04/19, 11:57:47 AM",Pranathi, It's the machoness man
24479,"15/04/19, 11:57:53 AM",Pranathi," He probably wants to play it ""casual"""
24480,"15/04/19, 11:58:15 AM",Sush, 🤬
24481,"15/04/19, 11:58:23 AM",Sush, or he's just COMPLETELY over me
24482,"15/04/19, 12:00:00 PM",Pranathi, No way
24483,"15/04/19, 12:00:01 PM",Pranathi, Lol
24484,"15/04/19, 12:00:18 PM",Pranathi," You don't get over someone so quickly after cheating on your wife for them, and you know that"
24485,"15/04/19, 12:00:28 PM",Sush, also i think he thought i was thinner than i am
24486,"15/04/19, 12:00:51 PM",Sush, and when he discovered otherwise he's like eh
24487,"15/04/19, 12:01:47 PM",Sush, i hear myself
24488,"15/04/19, 12:02:02 PM",Sush, but also idk i'm feeling hurt!
24489,"15/04/19, 12:11:55 PM",Pranathi, It's normal to feel hurt
24490,"15/04/19, 12:11:55 PM",Pranathi, And I would also feel so so so hurt in your position
24491,"15/04/19, 12:12:24 PM",Pranathi, He saw your body before at work also no? It's not like there was anything new. So the thinness stuff sounds less like it's coming from him
24492,"15/04/19, 12:13:21 PM",Sush, but i conceal it more in clothes
24493,"15/04/19, 12:15:19 PM",Sush, probably partly me
24494,"15/04/19, 12:16:14 PM",Pranathi, Yeah but I think he's really into you
24495,"15/04/19, 12:16:44 PM",Pranathi, And I don't have to convince you because the point is that we're also not wanting him to be into you because then it'll make you want to be with him more sighhhh
24496,"15/04/19, 12:18:33 PM",Sush, 😭
24497,"15/04/19, 12:18:41 PM",Sush, why can't he just be into me tho
24498,"15/04/19, 12:18:43 PM",Sush, ugh

24507,"15/04/19, 12:21:52 PM",Pranathi, Writing is just spurts of productivity for me. And then I do nothing the rest of the day
24508,"15/04/19, 12:21:58 PM",Pranathi, But I think it's okay
24509,"15/04/19, 12:24:20 PM",Sush, 2000 words is great progress!
24510,"15/04/19, 12:24:27 PM",Sush, takes a ton of energy no

24565,"18/04/19, 10:31:42 AM",Pranathi," Hi! I feel like I struck a wrong chord with you on the phone last night about the MBA thing. I could tell that it annoyed you, but I was obviously being flippant and ofc they value what they do and I'm no one to sit judgment on it. I said it somewhat cavalierly, and I hope you're not still annoyed."
24566,"18/04/19, 12:42:17 PM",Sush, Hii was in a meeting
24567,"18/04/19, 12:43:08 PM",Sush," I'm not annoyed! I just disagreed, I wasn't annoyed "
24568,"18/04/19, 12:43:27 PM",Sush, Didn't intend to come off as annoyed

24575,"18/04/19, 12:44:19 PM",Pranathi, But still I get the sense he might be a flake
24576,"18/04/19, 12:51:12 PM",Sush, what is his name?

24582,"18/04/19, 12:52:38 PM",Sush, hahaha noo he was clearly with you because he was attracted to you!
24583,"18/04/19, 12:52:57 PM",Pranathi, Yeah I guess. We had sex twice but then he didn't want to stay over
24584,"18/04/19, 12:53:10 PM",Pranathi, Which might be heightening my feelings of vulnerability atm
24585,"18/04/19, 12:53:41 PM",Sush, that does suck!
24586,"18/04/19, 12:53:50 PM",Sush, i hear you - it makes me feel vulnerable too
24587,"18/04/19, 12:54:48 PM",Pranathi, And he hasn't responded to my text 🤷🏽‍♀

24790,"30/04/19, 5:10:47 PM",Sush, It was very kosher
24791,"30/04/19, 5:10:58 PM",Sush, And actually was nice and pleasant

25498,"23/05/19, 11:10:32 AM",Pranathi, He's been very very very sweet
25499,"23/05/19, 11:10:48 AM",Pranathi, But he's clearly going to see other people
25500,"23/05/19, 11:11:38 AM",Pranathi, And I think I'm okay with it but sometimes I'm not sure I have the lack of jealousy that he seems to miraculously possess
25501,"23/05/19, 11:11:38 AM",Sush, that's so nice! I love how you sound genuinely excited about him!
25502,"23/05/19, 11:12:08 AM",Sush, Fair! I guess see how you feel as things unfold?
25503,"23/05/19, 11:12:07 AM",Pranathi, Yesterday some guy was hitting on me and Mike was encouraging me to like hit on him and I am not sure I could be so chill if it was him and some girl
25504,"23/05/19, 11:12:28 AM",Pranathi, So I feel like I am not woke enough to have poly type relationship
25505,"23/05/19, 11:12:48 AM",Sush," It's woke to listen to your feelings, don't fall into this trap!"
25506,"23/05/19, 11:13:11 AM",Sush, It's 100% valid if you're ok with it and 100% valid if you're not
25507,"23/05/19, 11:13:23 AM",Pranathi," I really am. He's got this amazing way of being entirely empathetic and open to communicating about anything. Also I love that he's such a good friend to his friends, and he's deeply intelligent"
25508,"23/05/19, 11:13:39 AM",Pranathi, Also the sex is the best I think
25509,"23/05/19, 11:13:51 AM",Pranathi, Yeah you're right. What is wokeness after all
25510,"23/05/19, 11:14:17 AM",Sush, those are all wonderful things!
25511,"23/05/19, 11:14:23 AM",Pranathi," Also, is Uday okay? Did he tell you or did you only glean from Sneha? I don't know whether to text him about it because I don't want to be condescending"
25512,"23/05/19, 11:14:37 AM",Sush, ya fuck all this woke. un-woke is if you're like eww poly that's BS
25513,"23/05/19, 11:15:08 AM",Sush," and again, like marriage, it's kinda moot to talk about whether you're into it or not in general"
25514,"23/05/19, 11:15:22 AM",Sush, you can only think about is THIS relationship with THIS person working for me
25515,"23/05/19, 11:16:55 AM",Pranathi, Yeah true
25516,"23/05/19, 11:17:02 AM",Pranathi, I like the way you think
25517,"23/05/19, 11:17:10 AM",Pranathi, I feel very into him though
25518,"23/05/19, 11:17:22 AM",Sush, so nice!!!
25519,"23/05/19, 11:17:25 AM",Pranathi, I sense that this could be either a very very beautiful thing or like a mess
25520,"23/05/19, 11:17:35 AM",Sush, hahaha
25521,"23/05/19, 11:18:33 AM",Sush, i hear you
25522,"23/05/19, 11:18:51 AM",Sush, but does it feel nice to feel this way instead of meh..?
25523,"23/05/19, 11:19:09 AM",Pranathi, Yeah for sure 
25524,"23/05/19, 11:19:11 AM",Pranathi, 
25525,"23/05/19, 11:19:28 AM",Pranathi, I am genuinely excited about a male instead of being like yuck
25526,"23/05/19, 11:19:36 AM",Pranathi, Which is surprising
25527,"23/05/19, 11:19:52 AM",Sush, yes!!
25528,"23/05/19, 11:20:24 AM",Sush, i'm excited to meet him also!
25529,"23/05/19, 11:20:32 AM",Sush, then i can put a face to the name
25530,"23/05/19, 11:21:00 AM",Pranathi, He is veeeery different from who I think you will expect to see haha
25531,"23/05/19, 11:21:05 AM",Pranathi, Fair warning
25532,"23/05/19, 11:21:13 AM",Sush, ❤

26131,"10/06/19, 11:32:39 AM",Pranathi, How to bring up?
26132,"10/06/19, 11:33:07 AM",Sush, #whowillbellthecat

26138,"10/06/19, 11:37:18 AM",Pranathi," Yeah? Sigh, idk I am worried about leakages"
26139,"10/06/19, 11:37:26 AM",Pranathi, I don't know whether she will go tell off to P
26140,"10/06/19, 11:38:08 AM",Sush, true
26141,"10/06/19, 11:38:43 AM",Pranathi, I decided to do a thing but now I'm feeling really silly for doing it
26142,"10/06/19, 11:38:53 AM",Sush, kya sis
26143,"10/06/19, 11:39:28 AM",Sush, say 2 me
26144,"10/06/19, 11:39:38 AM",Pranathi, I am feeling very embarrassed and pathetic
26145,"10/06/19, 11:40:05 AM",Sush, don't be! #safespace
26146,"10/06/19, 11:40:17 AM",Pranathi," So I was telling Mike about how I found these jazz maps of Chicago from the 1920s like a month ago, and he was so excited by the idea. He asked if I can show him some time. So I requested it from special collections and thought I'd walk over with him during our coffee meet and show, as like birthday gift. But now it seems so cheesy and OTT and he will clearly know I am pathetic at the core"
26147,"10/06/19, 11:40:17 AM",Pranathi, Should I just cancel it
26148,"10/06/19, 11:40:28 AM",Pranathi, Like I should be ANGRY no?
26149,"10/06/19, 11:40:37 AM",Pranathi, Instead of bending over backwards like some lame female
26150,"10/06/19, 11:40:48 AM",Sush, that's so sweet
26151,"10/06/19, 11:41:05 AM",Sush, it's not lame or pathetic at all!
26152,"10/06/19, 11:41:32 AM",Pranathi," But what if he's like ""oh i'm too busy?"" or he thinks, ""oh wow what a loser I dumped her, and she's still so into me that she went to all this trouble... she must be despo"""
26153,"10/06/19, 11:41:32 AM",Sush, but it's vulnerable and you need to decide if you're ok with being vulnerable (and it's 100% ok to choose either way)
26154,"10/06/19, 11:41:58 AM",Sush, it's really sweet and thoughtful and you requested it when you were dating
26155,"10/06/19, 11:42:08 AM",Pranathi, Yeah the vulnerability seems dumb considering I paid a penalty just now for being vulnerable.
26156,"10/06/19, 11:42:12 AM",Pranathi, Lol no I requested it this morning
26157,"10/06/19, 11:42:15 AM",Pranathi, I AM SO PATHETIC
26158,"10/06/19, 11:42:22 AM",Pranathi, 😭😭😭😭
26159,"10/06/19, 11:42:26 AM",Pranathi, I'll just cancel it
26160,"10/06/19, 11:42:35 AM",Sush, you're not pathetic!!! you're kind
26161,"10/06/19, 11:42:53 AM",Pranathi, I think it's a sign of real dumbness.
26162,"10/06/19, 11:43:04 AM",Pranathi," If you broke up with someone, but wanted to still be friends, and they did this for you - how would you react?"
26163,"10/06/19, 11:43:10 AM",Pranathi," Would you think ""how lame?"" be honest"
26164,"10/06/19, 11:43:17 AM",Sush, and it's like you had all these warm feelings and the receptacle of those feelings withdrew for some random reason but those feelings are still there
26165,"10/06/19, 11:43:22 AM",Sush, no it's not lame at all
26166,"10/06/19, 11:43:37 AM",Pranathi, But what if he is grossed out by my feelings?
26167,"10/06/19, 11:43:39 AM",Sush, newsid put fight to see if he could come to chicago a few months ago when he was in america
26168,"10/06/19, 11:43:43 AM",Sush, and i thought it was sweet
26169,"10/06/19, 11:43:44 AM",Pranathi, Why am I this oozing wound of gushing feelings
26170,"10/06/19, 11:43:57 AM",Sush, he won't be grossed out i promise
26171,"10/06/19, 11:44:04 AM",Pranathi, Aww that is sweet
26172,"10/06/19, 11:44:23 AM",Pranathi," Sigh, okay. I'll decide while we're having coffee. If he's being nice, I'll take him. Otherwise I'll pack and pretend I didn't do that"

26397,"14/06/19, 12:57:28 PM",Pranathi, Omg dropeful! I forgot about that. Haven't felt dropeful in two years
26398,"14/06/19, 12:57:29 PM",Sush, Am I saying your word correct
26399,"14/06/19, 12:57:33 PM",Pranathi, Yessss dropeful
26400,"14/06/19, 12:57:39 PM",Sush, It’s not pathetic at all more than natural sis
26401,"14/06/19, 12:57:46 PM",Pranathi, Trueeee it's just boring
26402,"14/06/19, 12:58:45 PM",Sush, Correct 
26403,"14/06/19, 12:59:03 PM",Sush, I’m a bit annoyed with Didige
26404,"14/06/19, 12:59:08 PM",Sush, We keep missing each other
26405,"14/06/19, 12:59:15 PM",Sush, But she does this whenever she gets busy
26406,"14/06/19, 12:59:30 PM",Sush, I don’t reach out when I’m busy but I respond p
26407,"14/06/19, 12:59:33 PM",Pranathi," Ughhh that's so frustrating, have you not talked in a while?"
26408,"14/06/19, 12:59:43 PM",Sush, No we haven’t
26409,"14/06/19, 12:59:55 PM",Pranathi, Maybe send a message asking if you can fix a time next week or something? That's what I did with Swetha
26410,"14/06/19, 1:00:10 PM",Sush, She called today
26411,"14/06/19, 1:00:27 PM",Sush, When I called back she was like sorry babe walking into Vaishu’s house
26412,"14/06/19, 1:00:52 PM",Sush, Which is fine I get it it’s Vaish’s birthday today
26413,"14/06/19, 1:01:21 PM",Pranathi, But yeah I can see how that cuts you out of a social interaction entirely
26414,"14/06/19, 1:01:23 PM",Sush, She kinda snapped at me two weeks ago
26415,"14/06/19, 1:01:26 PM",Pranathi, Why?
26416,"14/06/19, 1:01:39 PM",Sush, I was feeling very low and I called
26417,"14/06/19, 1:01:46 PM",Sush, She called me back later she was on shoot
26418,"14/06/19, 1:01:55 PM",Sush, And she was kinda like what happened?
26419,"14/06/19, 1:02:04 PM",Sush, So I said nothing I don’t want to talk
26420,"14/06/19, 1:02:11 PM",Sush, I mean she apologised immediately
26421,"14/06/19, 1:02:29 PM",Sush, Saying she had been up for some twenty hours and exhausted
26422,"14/06/19, 1:02:49 PM",Sush, and after that we keep missing each other
26423,"14/06/19, 1:03:03 PM",Sush, So I think that’s why I’m also placing more weight more on it
26424,"14/06/19, 1:05:39 PM",Pranathi, Don't be stressed friend
26425,"14/06/19, 1:05:59 PM",Pranathi, Perhaps she's just busy but maybe say you'd like to clear the air and just connect because you're feeling this way?

26429,"14/06/19, 1:07:48 PM",Sush, Just long distance
26430,"14/06/19, 1:08:00 PM",Sush, She’s trying only I guess
26431,"14/06/19, 1:19:57 PM",Pranathi, Yeah I guess she's trying 
26432,"14/06/19, 1:20:05 PM",Pranathi, But it does suck to not be able to contact and talk to her when you want
26433,"14/06/19, 1:20:21 PM",Pranathi, Maybe you can be a little more direct in asking to talk and saying you miss her?
26434,"14/06/19, 1:46:37 PM",Sush, Ya I’ll do like that
26435,"14/06/19, 1:47:49 PM",Pranathi, Hi bb

26621,"15/06/19, 7:46:14 PM",Sush, Ugh I wish they wouldn’t do it in already fraught situations
26622,"15/06/19, 7:46:19 PM",Pranathi," He's clearly not as hung up as I am, so I should really just let this go"
26623,"15/06/19, 7:46:26 PM",Pranathi, And reconcile myself to having zero expectations
26624,"15/06/19, 7:46:35 PM",Pranathi," All this ""let's be friends"" thing could've just been said in guilt also"
26625,"15/06/19, 7:46:45 PM",Pranathi," I think he didn't really mean it, and I dumbly took it so literally"
26626,"15/06/19, 7:46:52 PM",Pranathi, Because I'm hung up ughhhh I hate this feeling
26627,"15/06/19, 7:46:58 PM",Sush, He clearly wanted to have it both ways

26633,"15/06/19, 7:47:38 PM",Pranathi, I keep whining about this
26634,"15/06/19, 7:47:46 PM",Pranathi, I am feeling annoyed and sad alternatingly
26635,"15/06/19, 7:47:55 PM",Sush, No babe of course you’re having feelings

26638,"15/06/19, 7:48:33 PM",Sush, That’s true 
26639,"15/06/19, 7:48:35 PM",Pranathi," But here I feel like there was such a possibility for more, such potential. And he didn't even want to explore it"
26640,"15/06/19, 7:48:49 PM",Pranathi, It feels like a giant WHAT IF
26641,"15/06/19, 7:48:50 PM",Sush, Makes you feel cheated!

26645,"15/06/19, 7:49:15 PM",Pranathi, What kind of friendship is that!
26646,"15/06/19, 7:49:35 PM",Sush, You probably need some space before you can be friends no?
26647,"15/06/19, 7:49:42 PM",Pranathi," Yeah, that's true"
26648,"15/06/19, 7:49:49 PM",Pranathi, I really need to just let it go and not text him for like a week
26649,"15/06/19, 7:49:54 PM",Pranathi, It's just so hard
26650,"15/06/19, 7:49:58 PM",Pranathi, I have zero will power as a person
26651,"15/06/19, 7:50:00 PM",Pranathi, Like ZERO

26661,"15/06/19, 7:50:50 PM",Pranathi," Okay, it will make me feel like I can preserve the scraps of dignity I have left"
26662,"15/06/19, 7:50:52 PM",Pranathi, Good call
26663,"15/06/19, 7:50:59 PM",Pranathi, Tell me some dumb movie to watch?

27228,"30/06/19, 6:51:37 PM",Pranathi," I just got the feeling that maybe you were trying to avoid me, so I thought I'll tell you off instead of wondering"
27229,"30/06/19, 6:51:44 PM",Pranathi, But it could also just be totally in my head
27230,"30/06/19, 6:52:47 PM",Sush, Not at all!

27261,"01/07/19, 2:18:37 PM",Pranathi, Did you watch Aus Bachelor?
27262,"01/07/19, 2:18:43 PM",Sush, literally can't stop watching
27263,"01/07/19, 2:18:46 PM",Sush, no 
27264,"01/07/19, 2:18:56 PM",Sush, i can't watch the US one also by myself
27265,"01/07/19, 2:19:00 PM",Sush, it's too sordid
27266,"01/07/19, 2:19:06 PM",Pranathi," Dude, how to tell this Woobens I don't want to hang out?"
27267,"01/07/19, 2:19:09 PM",Pranathi, Like at all.
27268,"01/07/19, 2:19:17 PM",Pranathi, Every week he texts me and I've sort of been curt/ignored him
27269,"01/07/19, 2:19:23 PM",Pranathi, But he's not getting the hint at all.
27270,"01/07/19, 2:19:45 PM",Pranathi," I don't want to hurt his feelings, but it's also getting sort of painful"
27271,"01/07/19, 2:20:17 PM",Sush, oh man 
27272,"01/07/19, 2:20:22 PM",Sush, he sounds like he's flailing
27273,"01/07/19, 2:21:03 PM",Pranathi, Yeah. 
27274,"01/07/19, 2:22:27 PM",Sush, oh good!
27275,"01/07/19, 2:22:38 PM",Sush, tell you're busy for a few weeks
27276,"01/07/19, 2:23:50 PM",Pranathi, Yeah I'm saying like that
27277,"01/07/19, 2:24:03 PM",Pranathi, do you think this is how Mike feels about me?
27278,"01/07/19, 2:24:22 PM",Sush, Not parallel situations!
27279,"01/07/19, 2:25:13 PM",Pranathi," Okay, you're right"
27280,"01/07/19, 2:25:21 PM",Pranathi, How's your Monday going?
27281,"01/07/19, 2:25:31 PM",Pranathi, I just read a lot of Bourdieu who writes like a dumb Parisian prick
27282,"01/07/19, 2:25:34 PM",Pranathi, But he has some good points
27283,"01/07/19, 2:26:02 PM",Sush, i am reading a pair of germans today
27284,"01/07/19, 2:26:19 PM",Sush, writing about how to isolate cohesive subgroups in graph structures
27285,"01/07/19, 2:26:45 PM",Sush, they are also fairly obtuse and resort to math when they can't explain intuition which is v annoying
27286,"01/07/19, 2:28:11 PM",Pranathi, Ugh that sounds frustrating
27287,"01/07/19, 2:28:22 PM",Pranathi, I feel like reading academics is an exercise in learning how not to write
27288,"01/07/19, 2:28:45 PM",Sush, srsly! Andy was talking about that today
27289,"01/07/19, 2:28:49 PM",Pranathi," Also, I read this article and I'm just going to leave it here if at all you want to access it, but I should also offer cw"
27290,"01/07/19, 2:28:50 PM",Sush, i think he writes really well
27291,"01/07/19, 2:29:02 PM",Pranathi, But also feel free to ignore if you don't want to go down that path
27292,"01/07/19, 2:29:12 PM",Sush, thank you friend ❤ i will bookmark
27293,"01/07/19, 2:29:25 PM",Pranathi, I've never read his work actually. I should read something he's written!
27294,"01/07/19, 2:29:33 PM",Pranathi, I also love how Marco writes
27295,"01/07/19, 2:29:38 PM",Pranathi, He writes so simply but so elegantly
27296,"01/07/19, 2:29:52 PM",Sush, yeah? that's such a rare combination
27297,"01/07/19, 2:31:12 PM",Sush, i like how thoughtful marco sounds
27298,"01/07/19, 2:31:55 PM",Pranathi," Yeah, even the way he speaks and teaches exemplifies his modest genius"
27299,"01/07/19, 2:32:02 PM",Pranathi, He's so modest
27300,"01/07/19, 2:32:07 PM",Pranathi, So brilliant
27301,"01/07/19, 2:32:16 PM",Sush, avp isn't modest at alllll lol
27302,"01/07/19, 2:32:34 PM",Sush," like, he's not a dick"
27303,"01/07/19, 2:32:37 PM",Sush, but he's a showman
27304,"01/07/19, 2:32:45 PM",Sush, *andy
27305,"01/07/19, 2:32:53 PM",Pranathi, Hahaaa but that's also attractive in its own way
27306,"01/07/19, 2:33:12 PM",Pranathi, Sometimes I wish Marco wasn't so modest
27307,"01/07/19, 2:33:21 PM",Pranathi, It would be so much. Enter for his career
27308,"01/07/19, 2:33:31 PM",Pranathi, Better
27309,"01/07/19, 2:33:36 PM",Sush, over the last two months i've seen him narrate this story - about how JUST YESTERDAY his journal app (🙄) showed him a photo of his moving truck from *exactly* one year ago
27310,"01/07/19, 2:33:56 PM",Sush, he has done this on 5 different occasions
27311,"01/07/19, 2:34:00 PM",Pranathi, What's the point of this story haha?
27312,"01/07/19, 2:34:00 PM",Sush, over the course of TWO MONTHS
27313,"01/07/19, 2:34:08 PM",Pranathi, Where did he move from?

27320,"01/07/19, 2:34:43 PM",Pranathi, Hahaha
27321,"01/07/19, 2:34:54 PM",Pranathi, Did he realize?
27322,"01/07/19, 2:35:05 PM",Sush, it's actually kinda funny how everyone in the lab makes jokes about andy performing
27323,"01/07/19, 2:35:17 PM",Sush, ya i told him later and laughed
27324,"01/07/19, 2:35:21 PM",Sush, he was like story still works!!!

27329,"01/07/19, 2:36:05 PM",Pranathi, They take themselves way too seriously
27330,"01/07/19, 2:36:13 PM",Sush, i'm sure your paths will cross!
27331,"01/07/19, 2:36:20 PM",Pranathi, Meanwhile Marco explains Netflix shows' plots to me
27332,"01/07/19, 2:36:24 PM",Pranathi, He's so funny

27626,"15/07/19, 3:28:00 PM",Sush, like why am i supposed to know how to work a photocopier .
27627,"15/07/19, 3:51:51 PM",Pranathi, Hi why so restless?
27628,"15/07/19, 3:52:03 PM",Pranathi, In total agreement re

27630,"15/07/19, 3:52:11 PM",Pranathi, This country makes you do so many things on your own
27631,"15/07/19, 3:52:15 PM",Sush, really!
27632,"15/07/19, 3:52:19 PM",Sush, it is nerve wracking
27633,"15/07/19, 3:52:37 PM",Pranathi, I am also feeling just overwhelmed
27634,"15/07/19, 3:52:55 PM",Pranathi, Simultaneously feeling like there's so many things to do and there's also nothing to do
27635,"15/07/19, 3:53:08 PM",Pranathi, I oscillate between boredom and stress
27636,"15/07/19, 3:53:10 PM",Sush, ayy i hate that feeling 
27637,"15/07/19, 3:53:33 PM",Sush, i'm trying to reply to my D.U.M.B. RA
27638,"15/07/19, 3:53:43 PM",Sush," like, HOW is he a biostats phd student i dont get it"
27639,"15/07/19, 3:53:55 PM",Pranathi, Wow what a dumb
27640,"15/07/19, 3:54:06 PM",Pranathi, Although PhD has no correlation with intelligence
27641,"15/07/19, 3:54:11 PM",Pranathi, As you know by now haha
27642,"15/07/19, 3:54:28 PM",Pranathi, I think you have to be slightly dumb to want a PhD in the first place haha
27643,"15/07/19, 3:54:29 PM",Sush, ‎You deleted this message.
27644,"15/07/19, 3:54:39 PM",Pranathi, Lmaoooo deep cut

27647,"15/07/19, 3:55:06 PM",Sush, like literally how dude how is he an adult in the  world
27648,"15/07/19, 3:55:24 PM",Pranathi, What he did?
27649,"15/07/19, 3:55:33 PM",Sush, he is sending andy - 'collected list of variables from your paper' as a TASK he has ACCOMPLISHED this week
27650,"15/07/19, 3:55:45 PM",Pranathi, I want to get afternoon coffee with you at Fabiana's
27651,"15/07/19, 3:55:56 PM",Pranathi, Lmao how is that a job
27652,"15/07/19, 3:56:19 PM",Sush, srsly!!!
27653,"15/07/19, 3:56:37 PM",Sush, and then he is running two LINEAR REGRESSIONS of one variable on another
27654,"15/07/19, 3:56:49 PM",Sush, and saying 'Conclusion
27655,"15/07/19, 3:56:56 PM",Sush, for this you are studying BIOSTATISTICS?
27656,"15/07/19, 3:57:01 PM",Sush, they use v complex stats!!
27657,"15/07/19, 3:57:13 PM",Sush, i considered biostats and decided i was too dumb!!!!!!!
27658,"15/07/19, 3:57:23 PM",Sush, uuuuugh me tooooo
27659,"15/07/19, 3:58:09 PM",Sush, like literally i was like this is too much math and doesnt play to my strengths
27660,"15/07/19, 4:08:50 PM",Pranathi, Just got my eyebrows done
27661,"15/07/19, 4:08:57 PM",Pranathi, You tell him to exchange with you
27662,"15/07/19, 4:09:14 PM",Sush, worst fellow
27663,"15/07/19, 4:09:21 PM",Sush, he can't do one day of my job 😂
27664,"15/07/19, 4:09:25 PM",Pranathi, Tell him to give you PhD when he's earned it because it should be criminal to get one for being a dhadhi
27665,"15/07/19, 4:09:32 PM",Sush, are they on fleeeeeeek
27666,"15/07/19, 4:09:38 PM",Sush, srslyyyy
27667,"15/07/19, 4:09:44 PM",Sush, like what even
27668,"15/07/19, 4:09:49 PM",Pranathi, They are as in fleek as my measly eyebrows can be
27669,"15/07/19, 4:09:50 PM",Pranathi, On
27670,"15/07/19, 4:10:03 PM",Pranathi," Which is to say, not very"
27671,"[15/07/19, 4:10:12 PM",Sush, ‎GIF omitted
27672,"15/07/19, 4:10:20 PM",Sush, #bae
27673,"15/07/19, 4:11:07 PM",Pranathi, I cried at therapy just now
27674,"15/07/19, 4:11:17 PM",Sush, ayyyy what happened?
27675,"15/07/19, 4:11:28 PM",Pranathi, Chumma I was feeling sorry for myself
27676,"15/07/19, 4:11:33 PM",Pranathi, I have no reason to cry
27677,"15/07/19, 4:11:52 PM",Pranathi, But I realized today marks the 2 year anniversary of Nick breaking up with me
27678,"15/07/19, 4:12:15 PM",Sush, oh man! 
27679,"15/07/19, 4:12:29 PM",Sush, look how far you've come ❤
27680,"15/07/19, 4:12:38 PM",Pranathi, This is true ❤
27681,"15/07/19, 4:12:48 PM",Pranathi, But I was saying that sometimes I also miss the domesticity
27682,"15/07/19, 4:12:57 PM",Pranathi, And there seems to be no feminist way of saying that
27683,"15/07/19, 4:13:06 PM",Sush, That's entirely fair
27684,"15/07/19, 4:13:10 PM",Pranathi, Like it is a fundamentally lame thing to say I wish I had someone to carry my groceries for me
27685,"15/07/19, 4:13:22 PM",Pranathi, Or to veg out and watch tv with
27686,"15/07/19, 4:13:41 PM",Sush, It's not lame at all to express what you authentically desire
27687,"15/07/19, 4:13:59 PM",Pranathi, Yeah but my desires are authentically lame 😭
27688,"15/07/19, 4:14:15 PM",Pranathi, I think I'm only wanting that because I don't have it
27689,"15/07/19, 4:14:14 PM",Sush, no they're not!
27690,"15/07/19, 4:14:28 PM",Sush, i wish someone would split paperwork with me
27691,"15/07/19, 4:14:30 PM",Pranathi, If I had it I'd probably find some other reason to be dissatisfied with that
27692,"15/07/19, 4:14:39 PM",Pranathi, Ughhh I hear that boo
27693,"15/07/19, 4:14:52 PM",Pranathi, When Nithya's boyfriend so cutely planned the trip
27694,"15/07/19, 4:15:12 PM",Pranathi," I was like, man life would be so easy if I could just have someone to take care of the boring shit I don't want to do"
27695,"15/07/19, 4:15:14 PM",Pranathi, Like the dishes
27696,"15/07/19, 4:15:27 PM",Pranathi, Nick always did them lol
27697,"15/07/19, 4:15:45 PM",Sush, it all comes at a cost though
27698,"15/07/19, 4:16:01 PM",Sush," if someone's planning your trips, you're also not in charge of it anymore"
27699,"15/07/19, 4:16:17 PM",Sush, but there is a nice sharing of burdens to it
27700,"15/07/19, 4:16:34 PM",Pranathi, True
27701,"15/07/19, 4:16:51 PM",Pranathi, I guess if I had money I wouldn't even need a boyfriend hahah
27702,"15/07/19, 4:16:57 PM",Pranathi, I could pay someone to do these tasks
27703,"15/07/19, 4:17:02 PM",Sush, correct!
27704,"15/07/19, 4:17:07 PM",Sush, we all need a PA
27705,"15/07/19, 4:17:15 PM",Pranathi, So either money or a boyfriend
27706,"15/07/19, 4:17:19 PM",Pranathi, Prefer money tbh
27707,"15/07/19, 4:17:41 PM",Sush," and idk, i feel like research has shown overwhelmingly that married women actually carry more domestic responsibility"
27708,"15/07/19, 4:18:02 PM",Pranathi, That's true for sure
27709,"15/07/19, 4:18:03 PM",Sush," not just than married men, but than single women"
27710,"15/07/19, 4:18:27 PM",Pranathi, Yeah and also having to deal with the marriage penalty
27711,"15/07/19, 4:18:34 PM",Sush, yeah
27712,"15/07/19, 4:18:36 PM",Pranathi, Men get a marriage premium at work
27713,"15/07/19, 4:18:43 PM",Pranathi, Women take a marriage penalty
27714,"15/07/19, 4:18:48 PM",Sush, always
27715,"15/07/19, 4:18:57 PM",Pranathi, Ugh
27716,"15/07/19, 4:19:14 PM",Sush, i think companionship is the only problem it actually kinda solves
27717,"15/07/19, 4:19:24 PM",Sush, apart from reproductive things
27718,"15/07/19, 4:19:47 PM",Pranathi, Yeah and if they're a shitty companion then it's more of a cognitive and emotional load than being single and not having to be responsible for someone else's emotional well being
27719,"15/07/19, 4:20:05 PM",Pranathi, So the question is how to know how things will turn out with someone
27720,"15/07/19, 4:20:07 PM",Sush, absolutely
27721,"15/07/19, 4:20:15 PM",Pranathi, I really wish I had a crystal ball
27722,"15/07/19, 4:20:17 PM",Sush, i think we can't know also fully
27723,"15/07/19, 4:20:22 PM",Sush, a good part of it is luck
27724,"15/07/19, 4:20:29 PM",Sush, and ofc listening to some red flags
27725,"15/07/19, 4:20:44 PM",Pranathi," If I could know for certain that I'll be single and happy 60% of the time at 40, I'd take it"
27726,"15/07/19, 4:20:57 PM",Sush, i hear ya
27727,"15/07/19, 4:21:11 PM",Sush, unfortunately i think there are significant network effects to this
27728,"15/07/19, 4:21:22 PM",Pranathi," Yeah, I seem to be incredibly bad at reading these haha"
27729,"15/07/19, 4:21:23 PM",Sush," or at least that's what i'd hypothesize, with zero evidence to back me"
27730,"15/07/19, 4:21:44 PM",Pranathi, Haha every good hypothesis is backed up with some experiential knowledge
27731,"15/07/19, 4:21:52 PM",Sush, i imagine that single women with some minimum threshold of single friends are happier
27732,"15/07/19, 4:21:59 PM",Sush, than single women with no single friends
27733,"15/07/19, 4:22:10 PM",Pranathi," Yeah, 100% agree with this"
27734,"15/07/19, 4:22:29 PM",Sush, just the degree to which you can offset the absence of a spousal reservoir of emotional reserves with friends
27735,"15/07/19, 4:22:44 PM",Sush, reservoir of reserves it seems lmao
27736,"15/07/19, 4:22:45 PM",Pranathi, I spoke with Tanvi today about Meera's wedding and I think that might have something to do with how im feeling
27737,"15/07/19, 4:23:00 PM",Pranathi," I like it haha, very lyrical"
27738,"15/07/19, 4:23:21 PM",Sush, i think the only people who are 'good' at reading these are people who lucked out the first time and didn't need to respond to red flags
27739,"15/07/19, 4:23:29 PM",Pranathi, Tanvi is lovely but has very square notions about companionship and marriage and all
27740,"15/07/19, 4:23:51 PM",Pranathi," I was telling her how far off I am from all the wedding stuff, and she felt like she had to console me"
27741,"15/07/19, 4:24:03 PM",Sush, ayy
27742,"15/07/19, 4:24:04 PM",Pranathi," She was like ""don't worry you'll find someone"""
27743,"15/07/19, 4:24:35 PM",Pranathi," Paavam it's not her fault because what is there to say to that, but it totally rubbed me the wrong way"
27744,"15/07/19, 4:25:02 PM",Pranathi, And I was like you don't know that and also it shouldn't be what is offered as the balm to loneliness
27745,"15/07/19, 4:25:02 PM",Sush, true 
27746,"15/07/19, 4:25:27 PM",Pranathi," Yeah, what I wanted to say is that I would like to have more reliable friendships"
27747,"15/07/19, 4:25:39 PM",Pranathi, Tanvi and I talk once every few months
27748,"15/07/19, 4:25:46 PM",Pranathi, I wish we talked more and shared more
27749,"15/07/19, 4:25:51 PM",Pranathi, She's so closed off though
27750,"15/07/19, 4:26:10 PM",Sush, is she more of an in-person sharer?
27751,"15/07/19, 4:26:18 PM",Pranathi, She doesn't say anything about work or her boyfriend and it's this very Tambrahm reluctance to talk about anything good
27752,"15/07/19, 4:26:31 PM",Pranathi, Sometimes but not really
27753,"15/07/19, 4:26:36 PM",Pranathi, She's just very closed off as a person
27754,"15/07/19, 4:26:46 PM",Sush, aaah
27755,"15/07/19, 4:27:21 PM",Sush, my friend vaishnavi is like that
27756,"15/07/19, 4:27:30 PM",Sush, i like her a lot and it's always great to see her in hyd
27757,"15/07/19, 4:27:37 PM",Sush, but we can't have like a CONVERSATION ever
27758,"15/07/19, 4:27:42 PM",Pranathi," Anyway, I feel mostly okay but I think I just have too much time lately to dwell in my misery and loneliness"
27759,"15/07/19, 4:27:58 PM",Pranathi, Yeah? I wonder what it is about some people
27760,"15/07/19, 4:28:14 PM",Pranathi, I feel like that with Tanvi too
27761,"15/07/19, 4:28:33 PM",Pranathi, I also end up sharing less as a result which is probably not the best thing for a relationship
27762,"15/07/19, 4:28:42 PM",Sush, something must have made them wary
27763,"15/07/19, 4:29:05 PM",Pranathi, True
27764,"15/07/19, 4:29:13 PM",Pranathi, Done with work for the day?
27765,"15/07/19, 4:29:28 PM",Pranathi, ‎This message was deleted.
27766,"15/07/19, 4:29:51 PM",Sush, omgg

27777,"15/07/19, 4:31:49 PM",Sush," no, all different"
27778,"15/07/19, 4:31:57 PM",Sush, i guess andy will be at two of them

27782,"15/07/19, 4:33:31 PM",Sush, smart and thoughtful woman!
27783,"15/07/19, 4:33:48 PM",Pranathi, Ooh will do!
27784,"15/07/19, 4:34:57 PM",Sush, she even posts like the cost of her hormones / surgeries etc
27785,"15/07/19, 4:34:58 PM",Pranathi, Oooh she's so pretty
27786,"15/07/19, 4:35:19 PM",Sush, and talks about how it's a privilege to be able to go through the transition process like this etc
27787,"15/07/19, 4:35:24 PM",Sush," she is, no??"
27788,"15/07/19, 4:36:12 PM",Pranathi," Wow, yeah"
27789,"15/07/19, 4:36:17 PM",Pranathi, The post about self love also
27790,"15/07/19, 4:36:22 PM",Pranathi, So vulnerable and so true
27791,"15/07/19, 4:36:28 PM",Sush, i feel so happy to see all these young people
27792,"15/07/19, 4:36:30 PM",Sush, ya!!
27793,"15/07/19, 4:36:33 PM",Pranathi, There's no post-op self love unit

27795,"15/07/19, 4:36:42 PM",Pranathi, Aww truly
27796,"15/07/19, 4:36:50 PM",Pranathi, It is so nice to see!!
27797,"15/07/19, 4:37:06 PM",Sush, 'A month (?) old me. Mom wanted a daughter. Thought she didn't have one. Had one anyway. 
27798,"15/07/19, 4:37:09 PM",Sush, lol she's so chill
27799,"15/07/19, 4:37:33 PM",Pranathi, Hahaha amazing
27800,"15/07/19, 4:37:52 PM",Sush, i'm sure having supportive parents like she seems to is soooo important
27801,"15/07/19, 4:37:59 PM",Pranathi, I like this sort of fierce but vulnerable social media presence
27802,"15/07/19, 4:38:03 PM",Pranathi, It is very inspiring
27803,"15/07/19, 4:38:22 PM",Sush," some time she said 'whatever shit my parents get from others, they can still say beti doctor, beta engineer'"
27804,"15/07/19, 4:38:29 PM",Sush, it is!!!!
27805,"15/07/19, 4:38:38 PM",Pranathi, Yeah for suuuure. I have never heard of anyone in my family's circles even supporting their kids like this
27806,"15/07/19, 4:38:40 PM",Sush, it's such a shift from the prev 'gen' of feminism
27807,"15/07/19, 4:38:48 PM",Sush, ya!
27808,"15/07/19, 4:39:02 PM",Pranathi, Hahaha so funny and so cute
27809,"15/07/19, 4:39:26 PM",Pranathi," Yeah, I'm so curious to see what our generation's kids will turn out to be"
27810,"15/07/19, 4:39:34 PM",Sush, ya!!
27811,"15/07/19, 4:39:47 PM",Sush, i have to remind myself not to be resentful of younger people sometimes
27812,"15/07/19, 4:40:00 PM",Sush, of the increased opportunities / awareness they have
27813,"15/07/19, 4:40:16 PM",Sush, sometimes i feel competitive and have to be like no back the f up
27814,"15/07/19, 4:40:53 PM",Pranathi, Same
27815,"15/07/19, 4:41:02 PM",Pranathi, Especially with the opportunities around learning
27816,"15/07/19, 4:41:15 PM",Pranathi, But it's also hard not to compare sometimes and I think it's okay
27817,"15/07/19, 4:41:40 PM",Sush, correct
27818,"15/07/19, 4:41:42 PM",Pranathi, We're recognizing structural or systemic problems and I think that's fine as long as it's not resentful or covetous towards the people who can have it now
27819,"15/07/19, 4:41:47 PM",Sush, true!
27820,"15/07/19, 4:41:56 PM",Pranathi, Like with insti
27821,"15/07/19, 4:42:00 PM",Sush, ugh yes
27822,"15/07/19, 4:42:03 PM",Sush, god forbid
27823,"15/07/19, 4:42:04 PM",Pranathi, I still can't get over how shitty that system was
27824,"15/07/19, 4:42:25 PM",Pranathi," And that's a problem with *them*, not with the undergrads here who don't even have that frame of reference"
27825,"15/07/19, 4:42:36 PM",Pranathi, I hate insti so much sometimes
27826,"15/07/19, 4:42:48 PM",Sush, i knowwww
27827,"15/07/19, 4:43:08 PM",Sush, i harbour an almost corrosive resentment towards it
27828,"15/07/19, 4:43:29 PM",Sush, need to figure out how to let it go - harming precisely just myself lol
27829,"15/07/19, 4:43:42 PM",Sush, they are happily setting
27830,"15/07/19, 4:43:44 PM",Sush, *sitting
27831,"15/07/19, 4:43:52 PM",Sush, entrenched and content in their mediocrity
27832,"15/07/19, 4:44:15 PM",Pranathi, Yeah this is true. Maybe offsetting that with the education you had at UChicago? I think of people like Arya Murali
27833,"15/07/19, 4:44:22 PM",Pranathi, Who have had nothing but insti after
27834,"15/07/19, 4:44:38 PM",Pranathi, And I think that leaves them in a much more disadvantaged position
27835,"15/07/19, 4:44:52 PM",Pranathi, So disgusting
27836,"15/07/19, 4:44:54 PM",Sush, true but it's hard not to immediately shift the baseline to people who have had uchicago AND not-insti
27837,"15/07/19, 4:45:32 PM",Sush, i actually have a bit of extra resentment for economics vs DS/eng
27838,"15/07/19, 4:46:13 PM",Pranathi, Like the way Econ was taught there you mean?
27839,"15/07/19, 4:46:13 PM",Sush, literally not 1 person across like 10 batches of pretty damn smart people was tooled to go into a phd program (in econ or even anything quant) without another degree
27840,"15/07/19, 4:46:42 PM",Sush, unless it was like at IIT bombay which idk if that counts
27841,"15/07/19, 4:46:45 PM",Pranathi, Yeah so true. It was really such a sham
27842,"15/07/19, 4:46:46 PM",Sush, basically a top 20 program
27843,"15/07/19, 4:47:09 PM",Pranathi, That's so frustrating
27844,"15/07/19, 4:47:33 PM",Pranathi, Would you still be interested in getting an Econ PhD?
27845,"15/07/19, 4:47:39 PM",Sush, Nah
27846,"15/07/19, 4:48:07 PM",Sush, I think the moment I discovered other things I realized my interests / curiosities are not aligned really with the questions that econ asks
27847,"15/07/19, 4:49:52 PM",Pranathi," Haha yeah. Wish I'd had some more of this perspective before I jumped into mine, but I don't feel like it rips me apart in the same way it seems to does P"
27848,"15/07/19, 4:50:19 PM",Pranathi," I am like 70% on board with sociology, which is not a terrible place to be at"
27849,"15/07/19, 4:50:45 PM",Sush, that's a pretty great place to be at!
27850,"15/07/19, 4:51:26 PM",Pranathi, Yeah for sure
27851,"15/07/19, 4:51:50 PM",Sush, i  think i feel that way with 'data science' in general
27852,"15/07/19, 4:52:08 PM",Sush, like i think it has room for the things i want to do
27853,"15/07/19, 4:52:32 PM",Pranathi, I think that's a really good thing to know
27854,"15/07/19, 4:52:41 PM",Pranathi, Like where in the world you can see yourself fitting
27855,"15/07/19, 4:53:42 PM",Pranathi," In other news, I really like the word ""chutzpah"""
27856,"15/07/19, 4:53:47 PM",Pranathi, I want to be described as someone with chutzpah
27857,"15/07/19, 4:55:34 PM",Sush, ok i will say at your birthday party next year

27867,"15/07/19, 4:57:05 PM",Pranathi, I am saying loudly loudly in my apartment

27880,"15/07/19, 4:58:31 PM",Sush, dude
27881,"15/07/19, 4:58:55 PM",Sush, andy and erin both told me last week that i write code like a WHIZ

27883,"15/07/19, 4:59:13 PM",Sush, but i was like 👻👻👻
27884,"15/07/19, 4:59:16 PM",Pranathi, Hahaha I think you should own that compliment
27885,"15/07/19, 4:59:20 PM",Pranathi, Because you are a WHIZ
27886,"15/07/19, 4:59:28 PM",Pranathi, My little star whizzy friend

27901,"15/07/19, 5:01:21 PM",Pranathi, Omg I can't believe you share a birthday with him
27902,"15/07/19, 5:01:38 PM",Pranathi," But like I said, I share a birthday with this coked up druggie who dropped out of my cohort called Aron Milberg"
27903,"15/07/19, 5:01:46 PM",Pranathi, It proves to me that this horoscope stuff is false
27904,"15/07/19, 5:02:20 PM",Sush, 😂
27905,"15/07/19, 5:02:27 PM",Sush, he still sounds cooler than seshasayee

27931,"15/07/19, 5:05:56 PM",Pranathi, Just because you work all the time doesn't make you a nerd
27932,"15/07/19, 5:06:11 PM",Pranathi, He keeps saying he's v busy and that coding is actually very hard
27933,"15/07/19, 5:06:22 PM",Pranathi," I was like ""oh really? I wouldn't know"""
27934,"15/07/19, 5:06:45 PM",Pranathi, I am some dumdum anyway

27942,"15/07/19, 5:08:31 PM",Pranathi," I know you buy this, and I saw this"

27945,"15/07/19, 5:08:59 PM",Pranathi, Yeah instant pot would be so nice
27946,"15/07/19, 5:09:08 PM",Pranathi, It would make cooking so much easier
27947,"15/07/19, 5:09:37 PM",Sush, yeah!
27948,"15/07/19, 5:09:56 PM",Pranathi, Why is luggage so expensive?
27949,"15/07/19, 5:10:09 PM",Sush, i saw cheap luggage at tj max!

27951,"15/07/19, 5:10:23 PM",Pranathi, My suitcase is falling apart
27952,"15/07/19, 5:10:34 PM",Pranathi, It's the same suitcase my parents used when we moved to the US!
27953,"15/07/19, 5:11:47 PM",Sush, oh wow!
27954,"15/07/19, 5:12:03 PM",Pranathi, Oh Kindle's at 85 dollars now

27958,"15/07/19, 5:12:15 PM",Sush, i'm still tempted lol
27959,"15/07/19, 5:12:47 PM",Pranathi, Haha it's not bad at all I think. V reasonable and you'll probably make very good use of it
27960,"15/07/19, 5:13:05 PM",Pranathi, I also wonder about this DNA kit thing
27961,"15/07/19, 5:13:20 PM",Pranathi, I wonder if any of us would have mixed blood with the caste system and all
27962,"15/07/19, 5:13:31 PM",Sush," ya, no? my old one has been with me 5.5 years now - i got it in jan 2014"
27963,"15/07/19, 5:13:52 PM",Pranathi, 85 bucks over nearly 6 years is vvvvv good
27964,"15/07/19, 5:14:20 PM",Sush, i've been reading about how it could be dangerous for pvt companies to have that kind of data
27965,"15/07/19, 5:14:44 PM",Sush, they are sharing with big pharma it seems
27966,"15/07/19, 5:14:47 PM",Pranathi, Yeah even I read that. It seems ripe for all sorts of misuse
27967,"15/07/19, 5:14:52 PM",Sush, yaa
27968,"15/07/19, 5:14:55 PM",Pranathi, Oh instant pot is only at 56
27969,"15/07/19, 5:14:58 PM",Pranathi, Kindle vs. instant pot
27970,"15/07/19, 5:15:05 PM",Pranathi, What do you need moaaaarrrrrr
27971,"15/07/19, 5:15:20 PM",Pranathi," Half off instant pot right now, wow"
27972,"15/07/19, 5:15:23 PM",Sush, i can take kindle with me if deported
27973,"15/07/19, 5:15:44 PM",Pranathi, You sure you can't put instant pot in a potlam and hoist it over your head?
27974,"15/07/19, 5:15:48 PM",Pranathi, I feel they would not have any problems with that
27975,"15/07/19, 5:15:52 PM",Sush, 110 voltssss
27976,"15/07/19, 5:16:00 PM",Pranathi, Ohhh right

27981,"15/07/19, 5:16:23 PM",Pranathi, But you make an excellent point
27982,"15/07/19, 5:16:30 PM",Sush, then my sister and i figured 'here! take another instrument of oppression' was not a good bday gift
27983,"15/07/19, 5:16:36 PM",Sush, (she does not enjoy cooking at all )
27984,"15/07/19, 5:17:01 PM",Sush, (and sees it as unfair burden)
27985,"15/07/19, 5:17:44 PM",Pranathi, Ahhh that makes sense
27986,"15/07/19, 5:17:53 PM",Pranathi," Yeah, I try not to buy my mom kitchen stuff either"
27987,"15/07/19, 5:17:56 PM",Pranathi, She hates it also
27988,"15/07/19, 5:18:02 PM",Sush, ya no?

27991,"15/07/19, 5:18:24 PM",Pranathi, Yeah definitely
27992,"15/07/19, 5:18:33 PM",Pranathi, It's nice to cook for myself because I can do whatever the fuck I want
27993,"15/07/19, 5:18:47 PM",Pranathi, If I have a picky eater for a husband or kids I will lose my shit
27994,"15/07/19, 5:19:28 PM",Pranathi," My mom used to make kathrikai when I was a kid because my paati loved it, and if I made a fuss, she would literally send me off without food"
27995,"15/07/19, 5:19:39 PM",Pranathi, I hated her so much in those moments
27996,"15/07/19, 5:19:40 PM",Sush, i was insaaaaaanely picky
27997,"15/07/19, 5:19:44 PM",Sush, no wonder my mom hates it
27998,"15/07/19, 5:20:10 PM",Pranathi," Lol yeah, it must be so stressful to know your kids hate the food you're putting labour into making"
27999,"15/07/19, 5:20:18 PM",Sush, correct

28083,"16/07/19, 10:19:50 PM",Pranathi, She told her to her face that the program made her feel like she was doing pointless work it seems
28084,"16/07/19, 10:20:04 PM",Pranathi, I hate these pampered privileged kids
28085,"16/07/19, 10:20:11 PM",Pranathi, Who have the balls to pretend like they're the victim

28092,"16/07/19, 10:21:02 PM",Pranathi," So terrifying, the very thought"
28093,"16/07/19, 10:21:18 PM",Pranathi, Also I think half the reason I'm so outraged is because this programme is actually soooo good
28094,"16/07/19, 10:21:32 PM",Pranathi, I would've benefited so much if I had a course like this in undergrad
28095,"16/07/19, 10:21:43 PM",Sush, What a BRAT
28096,"16/07/19, 10:21:48 PM",Pranathi, And she found it worthless? Despite getting paid to be here??

28117,"16/07/19, 10:24:30 PM",Pranathi, Remember how we used to be so mortified if we even had the slightest inkling a prof knew about our relationships

28294,"22/07/19, 5:20:33 PM",Pranathi, I'm thinking I will just buy a Mac on my credit card because apparently they give your money back entirely as long as you return it in two weeks
28295,"22/07/19, 5:20:58 PM",Pranathi, Because I don't know what I'll do with all my time if I don't have a computer for a week lol
28296,"22/07/19, 5:21:01 PM",Pranathi, How was your day?
28297,"22/07/19, 5:21:26 PM",Sush, you can borrow laptops from the reg!

28302,"22/07/19, 5:22:29 PM",Pranathi, Ohh ok ok thanks for the suggestion
28303,"22/07/19, 5:22:42 PM",Pranathi, That's probably better than buying right now

28500,"27/07/19, 6:33:23 PM",Pranathi, Hi friend. Sorry I went off to sleep. I think some combination of overeating and the heat and the crowd and going to bed late put me in a super sleepy situation
28501,"27/07/19, 9:16:13 PM",Sush, No worriesss
28502,"27/07/19, 9:21:56 PM",Pranathi, Are you suuuure?

28504,"28/07/19, 11:59:57 AM",Pranathi," Hi friend. Maybe you're just busy, but I get this feeling that there's some distance suddenly, and I just wanted to check in. If I've upset you in some way, I hope you'd tell me so we can talk about it. If it's something else that has nothing to do with me, then I'll give space unless you want to talk."
28505,"28/07/19, 12:01:36 PM",Pranathi, I know we were only talking about breakfast today tentatively but I'm a little confused whether you didn't want to or something else came up?

28526,"29/07/19, 4:24:40 PM",Pranathi," Yeah it was worth it, I was chumma hyperventilating"
28527,"29/07/19, 4:25:08 PM",Sush,

28540,"29/07/19, 4:27:16 PM",Sush, full of natural light
28541,"29/07/19, 4:27:17 PM",Pranathi," Oh yeah, Bindu's friend Hannah runs that cafe"
28542,"29/07/19, 4:27:25 PM",Pranathi, Ooh. I've heard of that place
28543,"29/07/19, 4:27:34 PM",Pranathi, Who's the guy associated with it again?
28544,"29/07/19, 4:27:39 PM",Pranathi, I think Forrest worked with them too
28545,"29/07/19, 4:27:43 PM",Sush, jamie kalven
28546,"29/07/19, 4:28:02 PM",Sush, ohh that would make sense
28547,"29/07/19, 4:28:13 PM",Pranathi, Oh doesn't ring a bell. Wish you were in Hp still
28548,"29/07/19, 4:28:18 PM",Pranathi, I'd love to do lake time with you
28549,"29/07/19, 4:28:26 PM",Sush, i knowwww
28550,"29/07/19, 4:28:38 PM",Sush, i went to the lake the last three days
28551,"29/07/19, 4:28:43 PM",Sush, and thought about the point a lot
28552,"29/07/19, 4:28:49 PM",Sush, although i do like these beaches too!
28553,"29/07/19, 4:29:04 PM",Pranathi, Yeah you have a nice beach
28554,"29/07/19, 4:29:11 PM",Pranathi, I was thinking of going to the lake for a bit now
28555,"29/07/19, 4:29:31 PM",Sush, i don't think it's going to rain again also
28556,"29/07/19, 4:30:38 PM",Pranathi, Yeah. I'm just feeling mopey today lol
28557,"29/07/19, 4:30:53 PM",Pranathi, I worked in the morning and then went to therapy and I'm feeling done.
28558,"29/07/19, 4:31:13 PM",Sush, ayy i'm sorry love!
28559,"29/07/19, 4:31:13 PM",Pranathi," Mike asked if I'd like to see a show this week and I said okay, which day was he thinking and then he said he doesn't know what's going on this week and he'll keep an eye out"
28560,"29/07/19, 4:31:36 PM",Pranathi, Which is a little annoying because I want to see him but I also want to plan other things so I'm not sitting around waiting for him
28561,"29/07/19, 4:31:53 PM",Sush, yeah plan off other things!
28562,"29/07/19, 4:33:46 PM",Sush, otherwise you'll feel resentful
28563,"29/07/19, 4:33:59 PM",Pranathi, Yes correct
28564,"29/07/19, 4:34:08 PM",Pranathi, You think he's trying to get with me or blow me off?
28565,"29/07/19, 4:34:09 PM",Pranathi, I can't figure him out
28566,"29/07/19, 4:34:24 PM",Sush," honestly, i think neither"
28567,"29/07/19, 4:34:55 PM",Sush, i think he wants you to be in each other's lives - in the only he has the bandwidth for rn
28568,"29/07/19, 4:35:19 PM",Pranathi, Yeah you're right
28569,"29/07/19, 4:35:24 PM",Sush, *only way
28570,"29/07/19, 4:35:49 PM",Sush, he is clearly ❤ing you but can't do much about it
28571,"29/07/19, 4:36:13 PM",Pranathi, Because anxiety?
28572,"29/07/19, 4:36:24 PM",Sush, because preoccupied
28573,"29/07/19, 4:36:42 PM",Sush, intertwined with anxiety probably
28574,"29/07/19, 4:37:16 PM",Sush, feeling inadequate while having anxiety is an all-consuming activity
28575,"29/07/19, 4:38:42 PM",Pranathi, yeah that's true. Thanks for explaining to me ❤
28576,"29/07/19, 4:39:06 PM",Pranathi, I feel so lame for wanting this so badly
28577,"29/07/19, 4:39:25 PM",Sush, it's not lame at all!
28578,"29/07/19, 4:39:59 PM",Sush, it's infuriating and feels unfair that something we want is dictated by things that have nothing to do with us also
28579,"29/07/19, 4:40:37 PM",Sush, connections are so rare also - it's sooo understandable you're feeling this way
28580,"29/07/19, 4:41:02 PM",Pranathi, 
28581,"29/07/19, 4:41:10 PM",Pranathi, I feel like I talk about it endlessly lol
28582,"29/07/19, 4:41:22 PM",Sush, don't apologize!
28583,"29/07/19, 4:41:46 PM",Sush," if it's on your mind, it's on your mind!"
28584,"29/07/19, 4:52:49 PM",Pranathi," Yeah, feeling connection is so rare and I know it's going to be so long before I find someone else I connect with again"
28585,"29/07/19, 4:53:15 PM",Pranathi," Oh well, I guess it's better he figures out his stuff instead of me trying to actively chase someone who can't be with me"
28586,"29/07/19, 4:54:52 PM",Pranathi, I think I'm going to take myself to a movie at Gene Siskel tonight
28587,"29/07/19, 4:55:42 PM",Pranathi, There's a movie directed by Ralph Fiennes about a ballet dancer who moves from the Soviet to Paris and it seems interesting

28628,"02/08/19, 11:39:27 AM",Pranathi, He's not your boyfriend and he can't give you emotional support. And you can't have a boyfriend now so you have to accept the circumstances and be a badass single lady
28629,"02/08/19, 11:39:45 AM",Sush, omg why is she so conservative
28630,"02/08/19, 11:39:46 AM",Pranathi," No shit Sherlock, also easy for you to say lol"

28634,"02/08/19, 11:40:37 AM",Pranathi, It's like she's socially blind

28768,"06/08/19, 11:14:49 AM",Pranathi, I went to doctor because it was super itchy
28769,"06/08/19, 11:14:54 AM",Pranathi, And I had such a weird experience
28770,"06/08/19, 11:14:59 AM",Pranathi, This nurse was so weird
28771,"06/08/19, 11:15:19 AM",Pranathi, She sort of snorted and said she thought it was better
28772,"06/08/19, 11:15:22 AM",Pranathi, *bigger
28773,"06/08/19, 11:15:40 AM",Pranathi, And then I said I can leave if she thinks this is a waste of her time

28775,"06/08/19, 11:15:50 AM",Sush, what did she say?
28776,"06/08/19, 11:16:03 AM",Pranathi, And then she said I can do whatever I want but that it was kind of weird
28777,"06/08/19, 11:16:14 AM",Pranathi, So when the doctor came in I told her what happened
28778,"06/08/19, 11:16:18 AM",Pranathi, And she was appalled
28779,"06/08/19, 11:16:27 AM",Pranathi, She said that's really unprofessional and made me talk to clinic manager
28780,"06/08/19, 11:16:44 AM",Pranathi, And that lady also said that this nurse has a lot of complaints against her
28781,"06/08/19, 11:16:47 AM",Pranathi, For being abrasive
28782,"06/08/19, 11:16:52 AM",Sush, ughh
28783,"06/08/19, 11:16:55 AM",Pranathi, Weirdly it felt a little racist also
28784,"06/08/19, 11:17:05 AM",Sush, i'm sure that was a component
28785,"06/08/19, 11:17:15 AM",Pranathi, Like the nurse was black but I've seen this one before and she always treats me a bit condescendingly
28786,"06/08/19, 11:17:28 AM",Pranathi, How's your day going?
28787,"06/08/19, 11:17:57 AM",Sush," it's fine - started early, usual tuesday activity"
28788,"06/08/19, 11:18:03 AM",Sush, what did the doc say?
28789,"06/08/19, 11:19:17 AM",Pranathi, Doc said it's an allergic reaction to some bite
28790,"06/08/19, 11:19:29 AM",Pranathi, And that it might get infected because that's common
28791,"06/08/19, 11:19:35 AM",Pranathi, So she asked me to keep an eye on it
28792,"06/08/19, 11:19:42 AM",Sush, ah okay!
28793,"06/08/19, 11:19:45 AM",Pranathi, But nothing to worry about for now

28863,"08/08/19, 3:47:58 PM",Sush, what did murugan say in the morning?
28864,"08/08/19, 3:48:20 PM",Pranathi, It was saying murmur murmur be still my heart
28865,"08/08/19, 3:48:30 PM",Pranathi, It was very sweet
28866,"08/08/19, 3:48:36 PM",Sush, good good!
28867,"08/08/19, 8:58:27 PM",Sush, Yaar this Sam said something off putting
28868,"08/08/19, 8:58:38 PM",Sush, I can’t fully articulate how exactly it’s messed up
28869,"08/08/19, 8:58:42 PM",Pranathi, What?
28870,"08/08/19, 8:58:48 PM",Pranathi, As in what he said?
28871,"08/08/19, 8:59:27 PM",Pranathi, Dude I went to the Point this evening and who else should roll up five minutes later but Mike to sit with his friends who are like five meters away
28872,"08/08/19, 8:59:33 PM",Sush, I didn’t want to really engage so I was replying half heartedly
28873,"[08/08/19, 8:59:45 PM",Sush, ‎image omitted
28874,"08/08/19, 8:59:49 PM",Pranathi, The universe is so bizarre
28875,"08/08/19, 8:59:54 PM",Sush, Whaaat why is that boy haunting you
28876,"08/08/19, 9:00:08 PM",Sush, Isn’t that in v poor taste?
28877,"08/08/19, 9:00:13 PM",Sush, Like it’s not funny
28878,"08/08/19, 9:00:15 PM",Pranathi, YUCK
28879,"08/08/19, 9:00:19 PM",Pranathi, I hate that!!
28880,"08/08/19, 9:00:25 PM",Pranathi, He has no right to talk like that
28881,"08/08/19, 9:00:32 PM",Pranathi, Also he's a history major?!
28882,"08/08/19, 9:00:36 PM",Sush, Ya!
28883,"08/08/19, 9:00:41 PM",Sush, He got off his PhD also
28884,"08/08/19, 9:00:43 PM",Sush, Done
28885,"08/08/19, 9:00:44 PM",Pranathi, Like how does he not realize?
28886,"08/08/19, 9:00:54 PM",Pranathi, Dude it was the most bizarre thing
28887,"08/08/19, 9:00:59 PM",Sush, I don’t even feel like replying
28888,"08/08/19, 9:01:10 PM",Pranathi, He came over and talked to me
28889,"08/08/19, 9:01:16 PM",Sush, What it seems
28890,"08/08/19, 9:01:31 PM",Pranathi, He asked if I want to see a shoe
28891,"08/08/19, 9:01:33 PM",Pranathi, Show
28892,"08/08/19, 9:01:43 PM",Pranathi, And then he went swimming and made intense eye contact with me from the water
28893,"08/08/19, 9:01:49 PM",Pranathi, He is the most confusing person I know
28894,"08/08/19, 9:01:55 PM",Sush, Wtf
28895,"08/08/19, 9:02:04 PM",Pranathi, And Andrew said he was flirting with me
28896,"08/08/19, 9:02:18 PM",Pranathi, Like he was smiling a lot and asking about dumb shit
28897,"08/08/19, 9:02:27 PM",Pranathi, Am I crazy?
28898,"08/08/19, 9:02:27 PM",Sush, Not confusing this is textbook fuckboi
28899,"08/08/19, 9:03:08 PM",Pranathi, Yeah it's not worth it. You don't want to spend time just worrying he'll say something fucked up again
28900,"08/08/19, 9:03:23 PM",Pranathi, Yeah. 
28901,"08/08/19, 9:03:43 PM",Pranathi," I'm not going to text him, not until Rebecca leaves anyway"
28902,"08/08/19, 9:03:48 PM",Pranathi, She's staying with me this weekend
28903,"08/08/19, 9:03:50 PM",Sush," I mean, I won’t - I’m fairly indifferent. I’m just irritated"
28904,"08/08/19, 9:03:55 PM",Pranathi, Because Timna is going out of town
28905,"08/08/19, 9:04:09 PM",Sush, Ya just take the time off this weekend!
28906,"08/08/19, 9:04:12 PM",Pranathi," Sorry, didn't mean to imply that you would."
28907,"08/08/19, 9:04:28 PM",Sush, You deserve to have time without him fucking with it
28908,"08/08/19, 9:04:35 PM",Pranathi, I was just concurring that the boy seems incredibly rude and oblivious
28909,"08/08/19, 9:04:55 PM",Sush, Haan haan I know I didn’t take offence or anything!!
28910,"08/08/19, 9:05:01 PM",Pranathi, Yeah I'm just going to cancel him for a bit. It'll make me feel a little more in control also
28911,"08/08/19, 9:05:08 PM",Pranathi, Oh ok ok 💕
28912,"08/08/19, 9:05:14 PM",Pranathi, Today this Andrew said I was socially weird
28913,"08/08/19, 9:05:26 PM",Pranathi, And now it has me second guessing everything I am doing
28914,"08/08/19, 9:05:30 PM",Sush, What is all this normative rubbish
28915,"08/08/19, 9:05:37 PM",Pranathi, I thought that was kind of a rude thing to say
28916,"08/08/19, 9:05:46 PM",Sush, That is rude and normative
28917,"08/08/19, 9:05:47 PM",Pranathi, Like we're all socially weird to someone
28918,"08/08/19, 9:05:55 PM",Sush, Who is he to arbitrate
28919,"08/08/19, 9:06:12 PM",Pranathi," And I feel like if I have an opinion about my own fieldwork, it has nothing to do with him"
28920,"08/08/19, 9:06:19 PM",Pranathi, He asked me if I'm excited about fieldwork
28921,"08/08/19, 9:06:31 PM",Pranathi, And I said yes but also nervous and I am scared about leaving my friends
28922,"08/08/19, 9:06:58 PM",Pranathi, He said that that was a little negative thinking and that it was socially weird I would frame it like that when I got a grant and it's a good opportunity
28923,"08/08/19, 9:07:19 PM",Sush, What is socially weird even
28924,"08/08/19, 9:07:29 PM",Pranathi," It's like saying ""you are not supposed to feel how you feel, because to me this is not something to be sad about"""
28925,"08/08/19, 9:07:44 PM",Pranathi, Which is so normative and he would never move out of his fucking white comfort zone
28926,"08/08/19, 9:07:55 PM",Sush, Ya like who asked for his permission to have feelings
28927,"08/08/19, 9:07:59 PM",Pranathi, Also look at this girl Karlyn's post
28928,"08/08/19, 9:08:07 PM",Pranathi, This is the girl who he hearts
28929,"08/08/19, 9:08:11 PM",Sush, Single woman?
28930,"08/08/19, 9:08:13 PM",Sush, Lol
28931,"[08/08/19, 9:08:14 PM",Pranathi, ‎image omitted
28932,"08/08/19, 9:08:25 PM",Pranathi, Who? Karlyn?
28933,"[08/08/19, 9:08:48 PM",Sush, ‎image omitted
28934,"08/08/19, 9:08:48 PM",Pranathi, Who shows off like that about buying a house on Facebook? Who isn't 40 years old lol
28935,"08/08/19, 9:09:01 PM",Pranathi, Onggg you follow her?
28936,"08/08/19, 9:09:14 PM",Sush, Ya she asked for my handle at your birthday
28937,"08/08/19, 9:09:21 PM",Sush, So I followed her also
28938,"08/08/19, 9:09:25 PM",Pranathi, Lolol isn't she so excessive on Insta
28939,"08/08/19, 9:09:32 PM",Sush, Tired ass white feminism
28940,"08/08/19, 9:09:50 PM",Pranathi, Yeah it's almost a joke how unironic she is
28941,"08/08/19, 9:10:08 PM",Sush, She’s reminding me a bit of Maddie
28942,"08/08/19, 9:10:33 PM",Pranathi, Oh wow really?
28943,"08/08/19, 9:10:40 PM",Pranathi, Karlyn is one of the most annoying people I know
28944,"08/08/19, 9:10:45 PM",Sush, Same sort of trite feminism
28945,"08/08/19, 9:10:50 PM",Sush, Maddie is probably nicer
28946,"08/08/19, 9:11:02 PM",Sush, With fewer rough edges
28947,"08/08/19, 9:11:06 PM",Sush, She’s quite personable
28948,"08/08/19, 9:11:16 PM",Sush, She and I have no idea how to talk to each other tho
28949,"09/08/19, 7:51:26 PM",Sush, Hey friend how are you?
28950,"10/08/19, 8:30:51 AM",Pranathi," Hi friend, Rebecca is staying with me this weekend"
28951,"10/08/19, 8:31:10 AM",Pranathi, So we went out last night when you'd texted and I proceeded to get very smashed and threw up 🙈
28952,"10/08/19, 8:31:15 AM",Pranathi, How are you doing?
28953,"10/08/19, 5:45:06 PM",Sush, Haha Ayyo! was it fun?
28954,"10/08/19, 5:45:18 PM",Sush, I’m just trying to ride out this soreness tbh
28955,"10/08/19, 5:45:23 PM",Sush, Came to the beach with Joanna
28956,"11/08/19, 11:01:41 PM",Sush, https
28957,"[11/08/19, 11:03:42 PM",Pranathi, ‎image omitted
28958,"11/08/19, 11:04:01 PM",Sush, thank you!
28959,"11/08/19, 11:04:24 PM",Pranathi, ❤
28960,"11/08/19, 11:05:30 PM",Pranathi, This ice tsunami thing is stunning and terrifying at the same time
28961,"11/08/19, 11:05:36 PM",Sush, right?!
28962,"11/08/19, 11:05:46 PM",Pranathi, Wowow
28963,"12/08/19, 1:25:11 PM",Sush, dudeee
28964,"12/08/19, 1:25:32 PM",Pranathi, Hiii
28965,"12/08/19, 1:25:53 PM",Pranathi, What's up friend!
28966,"12/08/19, 1:26:56 PM",Sush, ‎You deleted this message.
28967,"12/08/19, 1:27:07 PM",Sush, because this thing has really been dragging
28968,"12/08/19, 1:27:12 PM",Sush, she _freaked out_
28969,"12/08/19, 1:27:13 PM",Pranathi, Push E?
28970,"12/08/19, 1:27:16 PM",Sush, ‎You deleted this message.
28971,"12/08/19, 1:27:19 PM",Pranathi, Ohhh
28972,"12/08/19, 1:27:26 PM",Pranathi, What happened when you told her?
28973,"12/08/19, 1:27:33 PM",Sush," like, hyperventilating"
28974,"12/08/19, 1:27:41 PM",Pranathi, Oh shit.
28975,"12/08/19, 1:27:51 PM",Pranathi, About falling behind?
28976,"12/08/19, 1:27:51 PM",Sush," i feel really bad but also like, impatient"
28977,"12/08/19, 1:28:04 PM",Sush, she was fixing some elaborate thing
28978,"12/08/19, 1:28:10 PM",Pranathi," Yeah, that's fair. You shouldn't have to nanny her"
28979,"12/08/19, 1:28:13 PM",Sush, and i said well we don't need that to work right now
28980,"12/08/19, 1:28:47 PM",Sush, i've been trying to give her aggregate data so she won't spent 1000 hours aggregating it
28981,"12/08/19, 1:28:54 PM",Sush, but that strategy didn't work
28982,"12/08/19, 1:29:08 PM",Sush, andy's putting a lot of pressure on me
28983,"12/08/19, 1:29:18 PM",Sush, i said andy's anxious to see some preliminary results
28984,"12/08/19, 1:29:24 PM",Sush, and i think that freaked her out
28985,"12/08/19, 1:29:29 PM",Sush, maybe i shouldn't have said that
28986,"12/08/19, 1:29:35 PM",Sush," but idk, it's a workplace"
28987,"12/08/19, 1:29:49 PM",Pranathi, Yeah just cause your friends doesn't mean you have to coddle her
28988,"12/08/19, 1:29:55 PM",Pranathi, And you were literally following orders from him
28989,"12/08/19, 1:30:09 PM",Sush, i don't want to manage her project!
28990,"12/08/19, 1:30:12 PM",Sush, we are too close IRL
28991,"12/08/19, 1:30:32 PM",Sush, and she's one of my closest friends - i don't want to jeopardize that
28992,"12/08/19, 1:30:51 PM",Pranathi," I can get why she's anxious based on everything you've told me about her, but let her process it and maybe have a conversation outside work about it. Say you were put in the position because of work, but that you appreciate her friendship"
28993,"12/08/19, 1:31:38 PM",Pranathi," But also that you can't back down because work is work. Put it on Andy, I'm sure he wouldn't be offended"
28994,"12/08/19, 1:31:47 PM",Pranathi, It's also the truth
28995,"12/08/19, 1:33:58 PM",Sush, yeah
28996,"12/08/19, 1:34:11 PM",Sush," and also like some basic questions shouldn't be this stressful, no?"
28997,"12/08/19, 1:34:38 PM",Pranathi," Yeah, and she's feeling probably less competent or whatever"
28998,"12/08/19, 1:34:41 PM",Sush, now she's going to spiral all week
28999,"12/08/19, 1:34:42 PM",Pranathi, Which has always been her insecurity
29000,"12/08/19, 1:34:54 PM",Sush, i feel horrible!
29001,"12/08/19, 1:34:59 PM",Pranathi, But it's not on you to coddle her in this situation
29002,"12/08/19, 1:35:03 PM",Sush, (and slightly irritated)
29003,"12/08/19, 1:35:07 PM",Sush, true 
29004,"12/08/19, 1:35:15 PM",Pranathi," If it weren't you in this position, someone else would've told her"
29005,"12/08/19, 1:35:25 PM",Pranathi, And she's going to get this a lot unfortunately 
29006,"12/08/19, 1:35:29 PM",Sush, andy's treating her with kid gloves
29007,"12/08/19, 1:35:46 PM",Sush, and is telling me to push
29008,"12/08/19, 1:35:52 PM",Sush, how will i push YOU push
29009,"12/08/19, 1:36:09 PM",Pranathi, Maybe it's good to tell him also about the weird situation that puts you in
29010,"12/08/19, 1:36:18 PM",Pranathi," You're her friend and you were in the same program, same year"
29011,"12/08/19, 1:36:25 PM",Sush," yeah, i brought that up last week"
29012,"12/08/19, 1:36:30 PM",Sush, did i overstep today?
29013,"12/08/19, 1:36:31 PM",Sush, idk
29014,"12/08/19, 1:36:39 PM",Sush, i should've set a time to talk to her about it
29015,"12/08/19, 1:36:51 PM",Pranathi, Don't doubt yourself. It's hard to work with friends
29016,"12/08/19, 1:37:13 PM",Pranathi," And sometimes you have to make decisions that will make things complicated, but I think she'll appreciate the position you're in too"
29017,"12/08/19, 1:37:28 PM",Pranathi, Just give her some time to process it all
29018,"12/08/19, 1:37:57 PM",Pranathi," She probably can't come to you with those insecurities now, but she seems wonderful based on everything you've said"
29019,"12/08/19, 1:38:38 PM",Sush, Yeah 
29020,"12/08/19, 1:38:43 PM",Sush, I do love her so much
29021,"12/08/19, 1:39:25 PM",Sush, she's insisting on doing a thing again
29022,"12/08/19, 1:39:34 PM",Sush, i can't say much beyond a point
29023,"12/08/19, 1:39:56 PM",Pranathi," Yeah, just let her do what she's doing and tell Andy that you can't be pushing her"
29024,"12/08/19, 1:40:09 PM",Pranathi, It will be way too hard to be managing her and also be her friend
29025,"12/08/19, 1:40:26 PM",Sush," Yeah, I'd really rather just be her friend"
29026,"12/08/19, 1:40:34 PM",Pranathi," It's a hard position to be in, I'm sorry "
29027,"12/08/19, 1:57:54 PM",Sush, ok she's calmer
29028,"12/08/19, 1:58:00 PM",Sush, and she has therapy this afternoon phew
29029,"12/08/19, 1:58:16 PM",Pranathi, Oh good!
29030,"12/08/19, 1:58:35 PM",Pranathi, Want to still meet for dinner today?
29031,"12/08/19, 1:59:21 PM",Sush, I think I'm having too much pain friend 
29032,"12/08/19, 1:59:31 PM",Sush, all i'm thinking about is going home to my ice pack
29033,"12/08/19, 2:17:46 PM",Pranathi," Okay, makes total sense!"
29034,"12/08/19, 2:17:52 PM",Pranathi, Please feel better love 💕
29035,"12/08/19, 2:43:03 PM",Sush, how is tomorrow?
29036,"12/08/19, 2:44:08 PM",Pranathi, I have panels for the presentations tomorrow and day after but maybe after the panel on Wednesday night?
29037,"12/08/19, 2:44:12 PM",Pranathi, It'll get done at 7
29038,"12/08/19, 2:44:35 PM",Sush, yeah! i have R-Ladies on Wednesday - it'll finish around that time
29039,"12/08/19, 2:44:49 PM",Pranathi, Okay maybe we can meet downtown for drinks
29040,"12/08/19, 2:44:56 PM",Sush, yess i like that
29041,"12/08/19, 2:45:07 PM",Pranathi, Okay sounds gooood 💕
