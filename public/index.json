As a recent alumna, and member of the program’s guinea pig cohort, I was excited to share my experiences from the last two years of being out in the world, and I figured a lot of what I shared with them is potentially applicable to a wide variety of data science job seekers.  There are literally hundreds of articles, listicles and essays about how to navigate the data science job market written by people with far more experience and wisdom than I have to offer. I will add my data point to the mix. A couple of things specific to my background that have shaped my experiences - I am a foreign national living and working in the United States, I have a background in economics and public policy, was a data scientist in a research lab at a university, and have recently made the shift to an industry position.  Find your competitive advantage.   Data science jobs have truly grown in scope and variety over the last few years, so it would serve you well to really examine where your competitive advantage lies. Allow job descriptions to help you make this determination - be wary of postings that ask for thirty-four years of experience with machine learning, natural language processing, data engineering, statistics and the ability to assemble a computer from a couple of chips and scrap metal. This likely means that the hiring team isn’t entirely clear as to why they want to hire someone. Clear, descriptive, and honest job descriptions will give you the information you need to gauge for yourself whether you are best poised to do the thing they want you to do.  Here are a couple of descriptions I like a lot - I can’t remember where they’re from, unfortunately, so I can’t shout out to the thoughtful managers that wrote them.  Examine closely for fit.  It is such a cliché but also entirely true that interviews are supposed to be a two-way street. You’re going to be spending 40-50 hours a week doing this thing, so you may as well ask for all the information you need, and really evaluate if this job is a good fit for you. Asking these questions also allows the interviewer to get to know you better, and it gives them more information to assess you on. When I interviewed right out of my masters, I was second-guessing having turned down a cushy job, in a precarious visa situation, and on the verge of running out of health insurance - this made me nervous and underconfident, and I ended up saying whatever I thought the interviewer wanted to hear. To no one’s surprise, this was not an effective strategy.  When I interviewed for my current job, here are some questions I asked my potential manager. A good time to ask these questions is when you’ve been offered the job, or are pretty sure you’ll be - these should help you make your decision.   What will I be working on for the first 3-6 months?   Who is the consumer of our team’s work?   What was this team’s last successful project?   What is the team’s engagement with open source development?   What resources will I have access to for continued education?   Here are some issues I would recommend discussing openly if you’re about to accept a research data science (or an econ pre-doc) position.\n  Is this gig a stepping stone to grad school?   What authorship ambitions do you have?   What is the extent of your collaboration with the PI, with students, and with research staff?   How much infrastructure development are you signing up to do?   What stage of a project will you be working on? Read between the lines closely to estimate the division of your time across data collection, experiment design, data cleaning, grant-writing, and paper-writing.     It can help to have an online presence.  I hesitate to bring this up, because it certainly does favour individuals with pre-existing privilege, with the time, energy and resources to dedicate to cultivating a professional presence online, outside of work. It is substantially more difficult for primary caretakers, people working multiple jobs, older candidates, people with interests and responsibilities outside their careers, people for whom it might not be entirely safe to be forthcoming with information in public. These advantages also distribute very clearly across race, gender, and class lines. It risks creating the Red Queen’s race - where you have to run faster and faster to stay in the same place; when enough candidates have something ‘extra’ to offer, it is no longer ‘extra’, it becomes what is expected.  Having said that, an online presence can be a low-stakes way to share your work, practice writing and communication, and generally allow a glimpse into the way you approach problems. If you’re in school now, it’s very likely that with a few extra hours of effort, several of your class projects can be repurposed into simple blog posts. At minimum, it helps when it is easy to google you - even just a concise and updated LinkedIn profile is helpful. If you are able to devote capacity to it - it can offer a long-form argument for why someone should hire you - it is substantially more information than a resume, and unlike an interview, you have full control over what you’re discussing, and how. Simple landing pages, elaborate blogs, well-documented Github READMEs, detailed LinkedIn profiles are all valid! If you’re an R programmer, blogdown is your friend, and Alison Hill has the most comprehensive instructions and troubleshooting tips.   Practice talking about your work.  You don’t have to be a drag and talk about your work all the time, but it is useful to grow accustomed to talking about your work informally. Practice talking about your work to people who are not your advisor, manager, or collaborator - talk to folks on the fringes of your discipline, and those entirely outside it. This will help you figure out what aspects of your job are more interesting to talk about, provoke curiosity, and follow-up questions, as opposed to what felt most challenging to do. Most of us have a tendency to talk about the difficult work because we’re understandably proud of having done it, but it might not be the best reflection of our abilities, or help us have an animated and engaged conversation - which is ultimately what we want our interview to be.  Learning to talk about my work has been difficult for me - I love what I do, but I’m usually loath to talk about it when I’m off the clock. I often explain things to my mother when I want a sanity check - she’s smart, willing to listen because I’m her daughter, and from a completely different discipline, so I’m able to figure out when something that seems obvious to me, does indeed need to be explicitly stated. Learn to use context and situational cues to figure out whether results-focused, methods-focused or process-focused explanations are best suited to exhibit your work.   If you have a connection, use it.  Again, this is another thing that I wish wasn’t the case, but unfortunately, it is. Credible referrals from people who know you in a capacity that allows them to speak to your skills, knowledge, and work ethic, can go a long way. At the very least, it usually gets a pair of human eyes on your application. If you’re asking for a referral or even just for information, ask NICELY. Remember that you’re not entitled to their time and energy. Ask specific, bounded questions (don’t say “hey, can you tell me about this job?” - they’re not obligated to guess what you want to know and write you an essay about their job). Offer multiple channels of communication, at their convenience. You don’t need to, and shouldn’t, grovel, but you definitely should be kind and polite! Send a thank-you note later.  If you’re cold-applying, really optimize your resume by matching keywords to the job description. Include a basic cover letter, even if it is optional. Don’t hesitate to prune your resume ruthlessly to really foreground your most relevant experiences.  Part II here.\n\n","date":1594339200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594339200,"objectID":"c5a350c3ab1a7d3533bb8cb45a762d6b","permalink":"/post/navigating-data-science-jobs/navigating-data-science-careers/","publishdate":"2020-07-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/navigating-data-science-jobs/navigating-data-science-careers/","section":"post","summary":"A couple of months ago, I talked to the graduating class of the MA in Computational Social Science program at the University of Chicago.

I’ve noticed, anecdotally, that I tend to be happier on days I get adequate sunshine, exercise, don’t use my phone too much, actually watch tv as opposed to letting Grey’s Anatomy play while I scroll aimlessly through Twitter, etc. Conversely, I’m more likely to wake up early, go outdoors, be productive, read and engage with other human beings on days I’m feeling happier.  Lately, I’ve become curious about the Quantified Self movement; it advocates the pursuit of self-knowledge through numbers. Thanks to the fact that tech is ubiquitously (and creepily) tracking our every action, there’s plenty of data that’s already passively being collected about each of us. For data about myself, I pulled my daily steps off my iPhone using this app, my Netflix history, financial transactions (to track daily activities - everything costs $ except the lake, parks and libraries) and transcripts of WhatsApp conversations. To account for factors beyond my control, I pulled temperature, location and hours of daylight for each day of observation.  If I want to understand the predictors of my happy days, I need some measure of my daily happiness. Since I haven’t actively been tracking my moods with a mood journal or an app like Happify or Track Your Happiness, I have to wade back into this data and come up with some metric to use as a proxy.  I live and work on a continent that’s very far away from my family and several friends - as a result, some of my closest and most meaningful relationships are conducted online. Since I often talk about my day over text message with people who weren’t part of my day, I wondered if the words I use to talk about my day could be mined to compute a happiness score, for want of a better term. I’m going to walk you through the exploratory analysis I did to figure out whether this made sense.  To do this, I first exported WhatsApp transcripts of conversations with four different friends to understand what this data looked like. All four are friends I have relatively substantive conversations with and are unlikely to have noise from forwards or tweets or cat pictures. I split up the text messages into sentences, and used functions from the sentimentr package to compute polarity scores for each sentence, using Baccianella, Esuli and Sebastiani’s (2010) SentiWord lexicon. With sentimentr, I was able to incorporate valence shifters; these account for words that negate, amplify, de-amplify, or overrule adjacent words with high polarity scores. Scores are grouped by date and sender, and then averaged. For instance, the average sentiment of the text messages I sent my friend Pranathi on Oct 21, 2018 was 0.32 .  Neutral sentences like ‘How are you?’ are coded as 0 with more positive sentences having positive sentiment scores and more negative sentences having negative scores. Here’s a quick look at the overall distribution of sentiment scores. As I’d expected, it looks roughly normal - most sentences are relatively neutral with more extreme sentiment scores becoming increasingly less frequent.  I know that I’m susceptible to the Sunday blues, so I wanted to see if I tend to send more despondent messages on Sundays. Turns out, not true at all! The valance of my text messages are, in fact, most positive on Sundays! Perhaps this is because we’re all animatedly discussing the wild, exciting Saturday nights (lol) of our twenties, but silently sulking through laundry and chores when the full force of Monday-dread hits. Adding to the noise here is time-difference - this data represents at least three different time zones and so, my friends and I are often in different moods and frames of mind when we talk to each other. The next thing I was curious to explore was - whose moods are getting reflected in the text? There’s naturally a fair degree of interdependence here - even when I’m having a great day, I’m unlikely to sound bouyant and pumped while talking to a friend who’s feeling miserable, and vice-versa. Conversations (ideally, anyway) involve listening and responding, and we could potentially hypothesize that the person initiating the conversation is likely to set the tone and the other person takes their cue from them. I’ve had the phone I’m using since Nov 2017, so I plotted daily averages over close to two years. I don’t really know what to make of these trends other than that I appear to use more positively scored words than my friends. To break this down further, I split these trends up by friend and I rather like what this reveals! In the words of the ultimate object of my bicep-envy (Michelle Obama), “When they go low, we go high”. I should also probably find a way to model my penchant for quoting things that are completely out of context but, look! There are several instances where a local minimum in one person’s curve is accompanied by a local maximum in the other person’s curve of somewhat similar magnitude. It appears as if when one of us is having a rough day, the other is being reassuring and responding with positivity and optimism! Before we cue sunshine and rainbows, however, does this also mean that when one person is talking about something very positive, the other is bringing them down? Without accounting for lag, I can’t say for sure, but this also makes me wonder whether highly positive (or highly negative) information is more likely to be shared over a phone conversation. These curves also appear to suggest that ‘moods’ are somewhat persistant and cyclical. I looked at the valance of my text messages alone, at two different levels of granularity, to see if they roughly correlated with my own memories of my feelings at the time and if any patterns I was seeing were artifacts of ggplot smoothing functions. I won’t go into too much detail, but they don’t consistently correlate, confirming that the words I use are not only a function of my own moods but also a function of my friends’ moods. I am, of course, an unreliable narrator of my own past and could be conflating the feelings I had while doing certain things with the feelings that surfaced when those actions bore fruit. Weekly cyclical patterns emerge when the ‘span’ parameter for geom_smooth’s loess function is set to a lower value. This controls the degree to which smoothing occurs; lower values produce more wriggly lines. So, should I use sentiment scores on my text messages as a proxy for how good my mood was on a given day? Shouldn’t I be trying a more sophisticated, tailored approach to classifying sentiment first? I’ve used a completely unaltered off-the-shelf dictionary-based implementation using SentiWord. This doesn’t take into account specificities of context, the fact that a non-trivial percentage of my text messages are transilterated Hindi, slang, expletives, emojis and GIFs. For instance, ‘Haha’ and ‘Hahaha’ are both rated as -0.59 while hahahahaha is rated 0. “What the fuck!” is rated -0.29 but “wtf!” is rated 0. Inexplicably, “This is amazing” gets a -0.23.  Before I whip tensorflow out though, I think I have enough reasons to believe that even with more accurate and specific sentiment classification, this is maybe not the best idea.   My text messages are not responses to my day alone, they are also responses to my friends’ days.\n There’s a lot of missing data - I’m not texting my friends when I’m hanging out with them IRL or speaking to them on the phone. What information I choose to convey over text is not a choice I make randomly and is likely correlated with the types of emotions I’m swayed by at that point.\n It would be a fairly strong assumption to make that anyone is consistently authentic and honest in communicating their feelings. Some of my most cheery Instagram posts were made on rather miserable days.\n  While I continue to think of alternatives to use as a proxy for my daily happiness, I’ve started to track my moods using the Daylio app. If you have other ideas, I’d love to hear them!

Three essays were most memorable. One is a very detailed and slightly absurd account of Patchett’s bid to join the LA Police Department. The Bookstore Strikes Back reveals that Patchett is a successful entrepreneur, in addition to writing engaging fiction and brilliant essays - is there anything she can’t do?! The titular essay is a sensitive, empathetic exploration of her parents’ marriage, her own ill-fated first marriage and finally, the story of her (current) happy marriage. I appreciate that she writes of a happy, loving marriage as a combination of circumstance, luck and hard work. 3.5 /5! \nI read Normal People on a very long flight in January, 2019. I’m writing this in August and even though I appear to have given it a 4 /5 rating on Goodreads, I have very little recollection of this book at all! I had to read Wikipedia to jog my memory. Neither Marianne nor Connel is a particularly likeable character and I keep mixing this story up with the plot of Lauren Groff’s Fates and Furies. The only highlight saved on my Kindle is the phrase “don’t feel like I’m rejecting you” with no context. Make what you will! \nI could not recommend Dreamers more highly. Snigdha Poonam travels across north India, interviewing young men (and the occasional woman) about their lives, livelihoods, hopes and dreams at this specific moment in time.I was fascinated by Moin Khan, the spoken english teacher’s mini-empire in Ranchi. WittyFeed, it appears, is a 30 million dollar enterprise in Indore that no one’s heard of, but has 4.2 million likes on Facebook - simply by “getting the internet better than anyone else”. The common thread among these individuals is the frustration, lack of faith in the system and a deep desire to distinguish themselves. Conspicuous absence of stories from the south and north-east, though. 4.5 /5! \nI inhaled this book in one sitting. As the cover art suggests, Oyinkan Braithwaite’s debut novel is a quick, racy story of two sisters in Lagos, one of whom, yes, is a serial killer. The plot is fast-paced and sexy, but the sisters, Korede and Ayoola, seldom deviate from their assigned stereotypes and all the men, as in life, are predictably disappointing. This is becoming increasingly common, but I do enjoy seeing realisitc representations of social media in fictional narratives. It would be great material for a Netflix film, tbh. I want to read more from Nigeria - so many cultural similarities with India! If you’ve been in a reading rut, this should pop you right out. 3 /5! \nI literally took four months to read this book. My old Kindle died when I was about 20% in and then I just didn’t read at all until I replaced it. I actually liked this a lot better than Celeste Ng’s debut - Everything I Never Told You. This book really is about ‘little fires’ - the small, nearly imperceptible daily undulations of familial relationships. It almost reads like I imagine a barre class feels. Mrs. Richardson and Pearl are maybe the most interesting characters here. Here is a very interesting case study of how Penguin Press leveraged social amplifiication on Goodreads to help Little Fires Everywhere spend over 35 weeks on the NYT bestseller list. 4 /5! \nI’ve been a great admirer of Emily Nussbaum’s for as long as I’ve known her work. I’ve found myself quoting her arguments for why TV should be taken seriously as a medium on more than one occasion. Most essays from I Like To Watch have already appeared in The New Yorker, but it is still valuable to re-read them in the context of the sections in the book. Against the backdrop of cancel culture, Nussbaum has a nuanced and well-argued take on what we can do with the art of terrible men. She has also seriously made me want to watch Buffy the Vampire Slayer immediately! If you love TV, you will enjoy this collection. 3.5 /5! \nI was led to Jia Tolentino’s Trick Mirror by an unlikely pair of influencers - Ezra Klein and Caroline Calloway - this is maybe the only sentence on the internet with both of them. Jia’s book is a collection of essays broadly about the internet, media and popular culture at this moment in time. The first three essays are my favourite - the first, really, should be on any contemporary syllabus on the internet and society. Always Be Optimizing is funny, nuanced and truly captures the fatigue of the endless optimization that (mostly priveleged, living in WEIRD countries) women find themselves caught in. As a (rapidly fading) Kardashian-stan, I found her account of her short stint on a reality show very interesting. I was mildly disappointed to find I didn’t relate at all to the essay on literary heroines. Some of the info-dumping was not necessary - her voice and and analysis give you enough to stay engaged. I’m excited to read more! 4 /5! \nWow, I’m definitely reading way less fiction this year than I typically do. I had read Richa Kaul Padte’s work on Deep Dives, so Cyber Sexy has been on my list for a while now. Padte takes a deep dive into the ways in which the internet mediates the consumption and offer of sex, the cultivation of desire, the freedom to explore, while also being a minefield of potential missteps, exploitation, safety risks and harm, all in the Indian context. She does a great job of breaking down so many complex ideas about consent, kink and desire with empathy, clarity and most importantly, contextual specificity. She doesn’t talk about her sampling strategy or methods at all, though. I suspect most interlocutors are English-speaking and urban-dwelling? Regardless, she’s an excellent writer and Cyber Sexy is an informative and very engaging read. 3.5 /5! \nI bought Maybe You Should Talk to Someone after listening to author Lori Gottlieb on my favourite podcast - Dax Shepard’s Armchair Expert.
