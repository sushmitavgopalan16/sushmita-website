My friend Haylee recommended this to me after I read Ann Patchett’s <em>Commonwealth</em> last year. Three essays were most memorable. One is a very detailed and slightly absurd account of Patchett’s bid to join the LA Police Department. <em>The Bookstore Strikes Back</em> reveals that Patchett is a successful entrepreneur, in addition to writing engaging fiction and brilliant essays - is there anything she can’t do?! The titular essay is a sensitive, empathetic exploration of her parents’ marriage, her own ill-fated first marriage and finally, the story of her (current) happy marriage. I appreciate that she writes of a happy, loving marriage as a combination of circumstance, luck and hard work. 3.5 /5!

I read <em>Normal People</em> on a very long flight in January, 2019. I’m writing this in August and even though I appear to have given it a 4 /5 rating on Goodreads, I have <em>very</em> little recollection of this book at all! I had to read Wikipedia to jog my memory. Neither Marianne nor Connel is a particularly likeable character and I keep mixing this story up with the plot of Lauren Groff’s <em>Fates and Furies</em>. The only highlight saved on my Kindle is the phrase “don’t feel like I’m rejecting you” with no context. Make what you will!

<p align="justify">
I could not recommend <em>Dreamers</em> more highly. Snigdha Poonam travels across north India, interviewing young men (and the occasional woman) about their lives, livelihoods, hopes and dreams at this specific moment in time.I was fascinated by Moin Khan, the spoken english teacher’s mini-empire in Ranchi. WittyFeed, it appears, is a 30 million dollar enterprise in Indore that no one’s heard of, but has 4.2 million likes on Facebook - simply by “<em>getting</em> the internet better than anyone else”. The common thread among these individuals is the frustration, lack of faith in the system and a deep desire to distinguish themselves. Conspicuous absence of stories from the south and north-east, though. 4.5 /5!

I inhaled this book in one sitting. As the cover art suggests, Oyinkan Braithwaite’s debut novel is a quick, racy story of two sisters in Lagos, one of whom, yes, is a serial killer. The plot is fast-paced and sexy, but the sisters, Korede and Ayoola, seldom deviate from their assigned stereotypes and all the men, as in life, are predictably disappointing. This is becoming increasingly common, but I do enjoy seeing realisitc representations of social media in fictional narratives. It would be great material for a Netflix film, tbh. I want to read more from Nigeria - so many cultural similarities with India! If you’ve been in a reading rut, this should pop you right out. 3 /5!

<p align="justify">
I literally took four months to read this book. My old Kindle died when I was about 20% in and then I just didn’t read at all until I replaced it. I actually liked this a lot better than Celeste Ng’s debut - <em>Everything I Never Told You</em>. This book really is about ‘little fires’ - the small, nearly imperceptible daily undulations of familial relationships. It almost reads like I imagine a barre class feels. Mrs. Richardson and Pearl are maybe the most interesting characters here. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/blog/show/1283-case-study-how-penguin-press-made-little-fires-everywhere-a-roaring-s">Here</a> is a very interesting case study of how Penguin Press leveraged social amplifiication on Goodreads to help <em>Little Fires Everywhere</em> spend over 35 weeks on the NYT bestseller list. 4 /5!

<p align="justify">
I’ve been a great admirer of Emily Nussbaum’s for as long as I’ve known her work. I’ve found myself quoting her arguments for why TV should be taken seriously as a medium on more than one occasion. Most essays from <em>I Like To Watch</em> have already appeared in The New Yorker, but it is still valuable to re-read them in the context of the sections in the book. Against the backdrop of cancel culture, Nussbaum has a nuanced and well-argued take on what we can do with the art of terrible men. She has also seriously made me want to watch <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em> immediately! If you love TV, you will enjoy this collection. 3.5 /5!

<p align="justify">
I was led to Jia Tolentino’s <em>Trick Mirror</em> by an unlikely pair of influencers - Ezra Klein and Caroline Calloway - this is maybe the only sentence on the internet with both of them. Jia’s book is a collection of essays broadly about the internet, media and popular culture at this moment in time. The first three essays are my favourite - the first, really, should be on any contemporary syllabus on the internet and society. <em>Always Be Optimizing</em> is funny, nuanced and truly captures the fatigue of the endless optimization that (mostly priveleged, living in WEIRD countries) women find themselves caught in. As a (rapidly fading) Kardashian-stan, I found her account of her short stint on a reality show very interesting. I was mildly disappointed to find I didn’t relate at all to the essay on literary heroines. Some of the info-dumping was not necessary - her voice and and analysis give you enough to stay engaged. I’m excited to read more! 4 /5!

<p align="justify">
Wow, I’m definitely reading way less fiction this year than I typically do. I had read Richa Kaul Padte’s work on <a href="https://twitter.com/deep_dives">Deep Dives</a>, so <em>Cyber Sexy</em> has been on my list for a while now. Padte takes a deep dive into the ways in which the internet mediates the consumption and offer of sex, the cultivation of desire, the freedom to explore, while also being a minefield of potential missteps, exploitation, safety risks and harm, all in the Indian context. She does a great job of breaking down so many complex ideas about consent, kink and desire with empathy, clarity and most importantly, contextual specificity. She doesn’t talk about her sampling strategy or methods at all, though. I suspect most interlocutors are English-speaking and urban-dwelling? Regardless, she’s an excellent writer and <em>Cyber Sexy</em> is an informative and very engaging read. 3.5 /5!

I bought <em>Maybe You Should Talk to Someone</em> after listening to author Lori Gottlieb on my favourite podcast - Dax Shepard’s <em>Armchair Expert</em>. Gottlieb is a therapist, writer and doctor, and writes about the journeys of four different clients as well as her own experiences with her therapist
