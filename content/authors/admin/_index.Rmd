## **Hi, I'm Sushmita!**
</br>
<p align="justify">
I'm a data scientist at <a href="https://www.grubhub.com/lets-eat"> Grubhub</a>, based out of Chicago. 
I design and analyse experiments, build machine learning models, and develop internal data science tools.

Prior to this, I was a data scientist at the <a href="https://sites.northwestern.edu/n3lab/about/"> Northwestern Neighborhood and Network Initiative </a> at Northwestern University. I used statistics, network science and machine learning to work on a variety of projects on gun violence and police misconduct in Chicago. As N3's first data science hire, I had the exciting (and sometimes scary) experience of setting up our computing infrastructure, data pipelines, and analysis processes from scratch.

I was on the board at the wonderful <a href = "https://rladieschicago.org/"> Chicago chapter</a> of R-Ladies. R-Ladies is a global support and advocacy group for women and gender minorities who use R. We now have a presence in 149 cities across the world and over 50,000 members!

I arrived at data science by way of Economics at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (<a href = 'https://www.iitm.ac.in/'>IIT-M</a>), policy research at the Institute for Financial Management and Research (<a href='http://ifmrlead.org/'>IFMR</a>), and <a href='https://macss.uchicago.edu/'>Computational Social Science</a> at the University of Chicago. I'm easily excited by the application of statistical and computational methods in public health, media and popular culture.
