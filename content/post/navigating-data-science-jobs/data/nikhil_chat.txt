[29/11/17, 9:58:06 AM] Sush: hello!:)
[29/11/17, 3:03:47 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Hello!
[29/11/17, 3:03:55 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Really, accountANT? :)
[29/11/17, 3:03:58 PM] Sush: Hahahaha
[29/11/17, 3:04:11 PM] Sush: I really don't know it reminded me of you so strongly
[29/11/17, 3:04:38 PM] Nikhil Dubai: For some reason I just went to WhatsApp and realized none of my messages were getting pushed
[29/11/17, 3:04:44 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I have like 16 unread chats
[29/11/17, 3:05:00 PM] Nikhil Dubai: What are you up to?
[29/11/17, 3:05:00 PM] Sush: Ayy so popular
[29/11/17, 3:05:10 PM] Sush: I'm in the lab I Ta
[29/11/17, 3:05:15 PM] Sush: It's the last class
[29/11/17, 3:05:16 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Most are work chat groups ‚òπÔ∏è
[29/11/17, 3:05:27 PM] Sush: So they're all chilling or have left
[29/11/17, 3:05:46 PM] Sush: I'm in an inordinately good mood given how much work I have this week!
[29/11/17, 3:06:25 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Me too! But that‚Äôs also because I just had a bottle of wine, almost
[29/11/17, 3:06:41 PM] Nikhil Dubai: And am finally getting a little bit of relaxation
[29/11/17, 3:07:39 PM] Nikhil Dubai: What kind of lab is this?
[29/11/17, 3:10:58 PM] Sush: Haha that's nice!
[29/11/17, 3:11:11 PM] Sush: This is for the computing for social science class I TA
[29/11/17, 3:11:32 PM] Sush: They just work on their assignments and ask questions if they have any
[29/11/17, 3:11:55 PM] Sush: I'm 100% wanting this one dude in class to ask me out after my last office hours lol
[29/11/17, 3:12:12 PM] Sush: Are you still in India?
[29/11/17, 3:15:46 PM] Nikhil Dubai: No, went to Riyadh on Sunday and just got back to dubai a few hours back
[29/11/17, 3:15:56 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Same dude you mentioned?
[29/11/17, 3:16:15 PM] Sush: Ah okay! For work, I imagine?
[29/11/17, 3:16:17 PM] Sush: Haha yeah
[29/11/17, 3:16:49 PM] Sush: I'm dying in my machine learning class but it is SO cool
[29/11/17, 3:29:54 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Yep, all work
[29/11/17, 3:30:03 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Lol
[29/11/17, 4:15:34 PM] Sush: Omg my students said such nice thingsssss
[29/11/17, 4:16:01 PM] Sush: AND my adviser said mine was one of the theses he's not worried about at all!
[29/11/17, 4:16:25 PM] Sush: I am not failing at life today üôåüèæüôåüèæüôåüèæ
[29/11/17, 11:30:57 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Hahaha
[29/11/17, 11:55:16 PM] Sush: Need to celebrate the little victories üòÇ
[29/11/17, 11:56:21 PM] Sush: Which I did by turning in my assignment with 30 minutes to spare
[29/11/17, 11:56:36 PM] Sush: As opposed to 30 secs last time
[30/11/17, 12:06:45 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Hey, 30 mins is plenty of buffer
[30/11/17, 12:07:02 AM] Nikhil Dubai: You‚Äôre not optimizing if you‚Äôve got more time to spare üòÅ
[30/11/17, 12:07:33 AM] Nikhil Dubai: I‚Äôm on my way to Abu Dhabi for a day long PS, which is McKinsey speak for ‚Äúproblem solving session‚Äù
[30/11/17, 12:07:44 AM] Nikhil Dubai: It‚Äôs going to be LONG
[30/11/17, 12:08:23 AM] Sush: Oh yeah I'm genuinely pleased about that - no sarcasm
[30/11/17, 12:08:41 AM] Sush: Lol will it be about a specific case?
[30/11/17, 12:08:51 AM] Sush: Also I'm applying next week! To McKinsey
[30/11/17, 12:08:55 AM] Sush: Data science
[30/11/17, 12:09:15 AM] Sush: Will send you my application after finals???
[30/11/17, 12:09:16 AM] Nikhil Dubai: It‚Äôs SUPPOSED to be about a specific case
[30/11/17, 12:09:47 AM] Nikhil Dubai: In this instance we are redefining everything a ministry should do over the next year
[30/11/17, 12:09:52 AM] Sush: Oh wow
[30/11/17, 12:09:55 AM] Nikhil Dubai: So it‚Äôs a lot of shit
[30/11/17, 12:10:16 AM] Sush: I thought that sounded really cool and powerful!
[30/11/17, 12:10:27 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Haha
[30/11/17, 12:10:32 AM] Nikhil Dubai: It does sound fancy
[30/11/17, 12:10:38 AM] Nikhil Dubai: In practice, mostly just tedious
[30/11/17, 12:10:54 AM] Nikhil Dubai: And bureaucratic
[30/11/17, 12:12:31 AM] Sush: I'm sad that _policy_ junta don't get to do this
[30/11/17, 12:15:14 AM] Sush: Not that you guys wouldn't do a _good_ job of it but that policy people don't get these opportunities
[30/11/17, 12:37:49 AM] Nikhil Dubai: I mean
[30/11/17, 12:38:03 AM] Nikhil Dubai: We hire a lot of what you call policy junta, I think?
[30/11/17, 12:38:13 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Or is this a more precisely defined group?
[30/11/17, 12:06:27 PM] Sush: I guess I mean policy think tanks
[30/11/17, 1:57:32 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Ah
[30/11/17, 1:57:54 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I think we work on narrower scopes than they do, actually
[30/11/17, 1:58:17 PM] Nikhil Dubai: The work tends to be somewhat more inclined to the pragmatic
[30/11/17, 1:58:37 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Although it typically doesn‚Äôt feel that way
[30/11/17, 8:23:06 PM] Sush: Hmm okay!
[07/12/17, 2:58:22 AM] Sush: Hiii
[07/12/17, 2:58:31 AM] Sush: I'm in your neighbourhood
[07/12/17, 2:58:37 AM] Sush: Abu Dhabi
[07/12/17, 3:01:28 AM] Sush: Called by accident!!
[07/12/17, 3:01:30 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Hey!
[07/12/17, 3:01:35 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Yeah, I was wondering
[07/12/17, 3:01:54 AM] Sush: Ya i didn't realise it was calling
[07/12/17, 3:02:00 AM] Nikhil Dubai: We‚Äôre just about to kick off our big presentation that we‚Äôve been working on with 50 different presenters
[07/12/17, 3:02:14 AM] Sush: Oooh good luck!!!
[07/12/17, 3:02:19 AM] Nikhil Dubai: To the minister and all the provincial governors here
[07/12/17, 3:02:26 AM] Sush: Very cool!
[07/12/17, 3:03:40 AM] Sush: I'm on my way hooome
[07/12/17, 3:03:45 AM] Sush: Will you be presenting?
[07/12/17, 3:21:47 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Oh no, the people we were working with will
[10/12/17, 2:44:14 PM] Sush: Hii
[10/12/17, 2:54:47 PM] Sush: I need a book recommendation!!
[10/12/17, 11:01:57 PM] Nikhil Dubai: What kind?
[10/12/17, 11:19:09 PM] Sush: Fiction!
[10/12/17, 11:19:22 PM] Sush: I have holidays
[10/12/17, 11:19:43 PM] Sush: And will be v embarrassed if I fail to meet my v v v meagre goal of 20 books in 2017
[10/12/17, 11:20:09 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I just finished 3 books of the gentleman bastards series - fantasy version of oceans 11 with extra drama and some magic
[10/12/17, 11:20:16 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs your type though
[10/12/17, 11:20:24 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Even though it‚Äôs quite well written
[10/12/17, 11:20:47 PM] Sush: Aah it sounds like too much
[18/12/17, 5:21:17 AM] Sush: Hii
[18/12/17, 9:01:58 AM] Nikhil Dubai: hey :)
[18/12/17, 9:02:10 AM] Nikhil Dubai: how's it going?
[18/12/17, 9:53:48 AM] Sush: It's going okayyy!
[18/12/17, 9:53:51 AM] Sush: How are you?
[18/12/17, 1:26:52 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Last week on my rather annoying project
[18/12/17, 1:27:49 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Doing those labs again for the rest of the country
[18/12/17, 1:27:54 PM] Nikhil Dubai: On break yet?
[18/12/17, 1:28:13 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Ah yes you mentioned :)
[18/12/17, 11:10:27 PM] Sush: Ohhh
[18/12/17, 11:10:37 PM] Sush: Yesss I'm in Hyderabad
[19/12/17, 12:52:20 AM] Nikhil Dubai: I feel like you were there very recently, relatively speaking, but I‚Äôm assuming that‚Äôs just days blurring
[19/12/17, 12:52:26 AM] Nikhil Dubai: How‚Äôs being home though?
[19/12/17, 12:53:17 AM] Sush: No I was haha
[19/12/17, 12:53:25 AM] Sush: I was here in September
[19/12/17, 12:53:39 AM] Sush: Home is good!
[19/12/17, 12:56:14 AM] Sush: I ended up starting Anna Karenina
[19/12/17, 12:56:50 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Haha
[19/12/17, 12:57:35 AM] Sush: It alternates between being exciting and leaving me extra melancholy
[19/12/17, 3:05:36 AM] Sush: Can you look at a draft of my resume?!
[19/12/17, 3:05:46 AM] Sush: It's a preliminary draft - be harsh?
[19/12/17, 3:05:58 AM] Sush: I want to use it for McKinsey
[19/12/17, 3:06:10 AM] Sush: Data science position
[19/12/17, 3:47:11 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Of course, send through :)
[19/12/17, 3:48:03 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Is there a deadline?
‚Äé[19/12/17, 3:48:47 AM] Sush: untitled ‚Ä¢ ‚Äé1 page ‚Äédocument omitted
[19/12/17, 3:49:06 AM] Sush: Thanks!:)
[19/12/17, 3:49:13 AM] Sush: Is it better to email?
[19/12/17, 3:49:16 AM] Sush: No there isn't
[19/12/17, 3:49:35 AM] Sush: But I want to get the applications out while I'm in india
[19/12/17, 4:04:06 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Ah ok. I‚Äôll try for tomorrow but may be more realistic by Friday :)
[19/12/17, 4:04:25 AM] Sush: That works!!
[19/12/17, 4:04:30 AM] Sush: Thank you :)
[19/12/17, 4:04:58 AM] Sush: Have you seen The Crown?
[19/12/17, 4:11:13 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Yep... season 2 is depressing though
[19/12/17, 4:11:19 AM] Nikhil Dubai: I‚Äôm about halfway through it
[19/12/17, 4:15:40 AM] Sush: Yeah I'm two episodes in
[19/12/17, 4:15:45 AM] Sush: It's been a lot of Philip
[19/12/17, 5:33:20 AM] Nikhil Dubai: So apparently they just fired a missile from Yemen next to the hotel we are at right now
[19/12/17, 5:34:12 AM] Sush: !!!!
[19/12/17, 5:34:31 AM] Sush: Are you being asked to evacuate?!
[19/12/17, 5:34:45 AM] Nikhil Dubai: No, not yet
[19/12/17, 5:35:04 AM] Nikhil Dubai: I mean, I think it was intercepted and stuff
[19/12/17, 5:35:18 AM] Nikhil Dubai: but we were wondering whether we should
[19/12/17, 5:35:25 AM] Sush: Wait where are you again?
[19/12/17, 5:35:39 AM] Nikhil Dubai: We're holding an event for like 300 people so this would be a whole deal
[19/12/17, 5:35:45 AM] Sush: Damn!!
[19/12/17, 5:35:49 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Riyadh
[19/12/17, 5:36:11 AM] Nikhil Dubai: I mean I'm sure it would be a whole deal anyway, we're in the middle of the city
[19/12/17, 5:36:59 AM] Sush: I hope you guys decide to evacuate!!
[19/12/17, 5:37:46 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Realistically I don't think we're at a particularly higher risk than we were before
[19/12/17, 5:37:53 AM] Nikhil Dubai: I'm just reevaluating what that risk level is
[19/12/17, 5:39:21 AM] Sush: Makes sense. This is scary!
[19/12/17, 5:39:57 AM] Nikhil Dubai: 2 more days and then I'm off for 3 weeks :)
[19/12/17, 5:40:08 AM] Sush: Lovely!
[19/12/17, 5:40:08 AM] Nikhil Dubai: flying from riyadh tomorrow night and then to kerala on thursday night
[19/12/17, 5:40:12 AM] Nikhil Dubai: *to dubai
[19/12/17, 5:40:15 AM] Nikhil Dubai: and then kera;a
[19/12/17, 5:40:24 AM] Nikhil Dubai: and then new zealand :)
[19/12/17, 5:40:39 AM] Sush: Next time I come to India I'll plan a layover in Dubai?!
[19/12/17, 5:40:53 AM] Sush: If you guys are in town then ofc
[19/12/17, 5:41:14 AM] Sush: Ooh New Zealand! Family trip?
[19/12/17, 5:41:46 AM] Sush: Although I won't be back in India for another eight or so months lol
[19/12/17, 5:42:26 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Yes, visit!
[19/12/17, 5:42:56 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Although doesn't really work unless its a weekend since I may not be in town :)
[19/12/17, 5:42:59 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Yeah family trip
[19/12/17, 5:43:12 AM] Sush: Ok will keep that in mind!
[19/12/17, 5:43:17 AM] Sush: Fun!!
[19/12/17, 5:45:19 AM] Sush: Family means yours or Mia's or both?
[19/12/17, 5:48:59 AM] Nikhil Dubai: So we‚Äôre doing 3.5 days in Trivandrum with her family, 1.5 days in Cochin with my extended family, then 8 days in nz with my family.
[19/12/17, 8:33:39 PM] Sush: Nice!
[22/12/17, 2:28:28 AM] Sush: I have to get spectacles üòê
[22/12/17, 2:28:58 AM] Nikhil Dubai: This is such an awful question but haven‚Äôt you had them before?
[22/12/17, 2:29:04 AM] Sush: Hahahaha noooo
[22/12/17, 2:29:11 AM] Sush: Now I'm wondering if you have them
[22/12/17, 2:29:34 AM] Sush: I want to say no?
[22/12/17, 2:29:35 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Also i was going to ask if you ever mailed me your resume and then I scrolled up and saw you sent on WhatsApp
[22/12/17, 2:29:39 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Will go through now
[22/12/17, 2:29:41 AM] Nikhil Dubai: No :)
[22/12/17, 2:29:48 AM] Sush: Thanks! Should I email instead?
[22/12/17, 2:31:47 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Nah I mailed it to myself
[22/12/17, 2:31:48 AM] Nikhil Dubai: So
[22/12/17, 2:31:51 AM] Nikhil Dubai: As a rule
[22/12/17, 2:32:25 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Most companies now tend to prefer resumes where you lost accomplishments rather than ‚Äúresponsible for‚Äù, which is fairly limited in what it conveys
[22/12/17, 2:32:53 AM] Sush: Hmm okay. So more 'active' words?
[22/12/17, 2:33:19 AM] Sush: What I improved, optimised etc?
[22/12/17, 2:33:34 AM] Sush: I also realise there are no quantified accomplishments
[22/12/17, 2:36:37 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Yes
[22/12/17, 2:36:38 AM] Nikhil Dubai: To both
[22/12/17, 2:37:09 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Even if what you did was par for the course for your job , make it sound like an accomplishment
[22/12/17, 2:37:19 AM] Nikhil Dubai: And quantify as far as possible
[22/12/17, 2:37:33 AM] Sush: Okay!üòÖ
[22/12/17, 2:38:46 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Also you said you‚Äôre applying for an analytics program at Mckinsey and not standard consulting track? Because these are all very much in that vein - you‚Äôd have to rewrite a lot for consulting track
[22/12/17, 2:39:19 AM] Sush: Yes! I'm looking at analytics positions, not consulting
[22/12/17, 2:39:44 AM] Sush: Out of academic interest - what would have to be different for consulting?
[22/12/17, 2:39:59 AM] Sush: Also - does it make sense that I've left out my undergrad internships?
[22/12/17, 2:40:11 AM] Sush: Except the last one
[22/12/17, 2:40:17 AM] Sush: ISB, IFMR
[22/12/17, 2:43:07 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Even so given that it‚Äôs a consulting firm I‚Äôd change some things :). Cut the course details from your TAships - don‚Äôt know that it really matters since you have a skills section, and instead reframe both into one and say ‚ÄúManaged grading(...) for X students‚Äù. If possible add ‚Äúmentored Y students‚Äú, have some story you can use in the interviews on some poor kids who only got through this course thanks to your diligence and passion :)
[22/12/17, 2:44:15 AM] Nikhil Dubai: For consulting in general, much more focus on quantified impact rather than skills
[22/12/17, 2:45:20 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Yeah - you could put a line for each of the undergrad internships if you have space and you did something very impressive, but I wouldn‚Äôt forcefit
[22/12/17, 2:46:30 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Your IFMR section is pretty spot on :)
[22/12/17, 2:46:56 AM] Sush: Hahah ok!
[22/12/17, 2:47:01 AM] Sush: Ok that's useful!!
[22/12/17, 2:47:50 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Add machine learning to skills actually.
[22/12/17, 2:47:53 AM] Nikhil Dubai: No?
[22/12/17, 2:48:07 AM] Sush: Ooh ok! Ya I was wondering about that
[22/12/17, 2:48:25 AM] Sush: Taking a deep learning class this quarter too maybe
[22/12/17, 2:48:37 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Add away üòõ
[22/12/17, 2:48:56 AM] Sush: Hahaha
[22/12/17, 2:49:03 AM] Sush: This all makes sense
[22/12/17, 2:49:11 AM] Nikhil Dubai: And can you beef up the compass lexicon section?
[22/12/17, 2:49:21 AM] Sush: Do you think th  projects section is fluffy?
[22/12/17, 2:49:43 AM] Nikhil Dubai: You can‚Äôt put details of cases you did I assume but maybe something on what the stuff was for? To add flavor if nothing else
[22/12/17, 2:49:50 AM] Sush: Ya I should! I'm thinking about how to do this since I can't put case details
[22/12/17, 2:49:52 AM] Nikhil Dubai: That‚Äôs the most relevant experience you have, right?
[22/12/17, 2:49:56 AM] Sush: Yeah
[22/12/17, 2:52:13 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Right now it doesn‚Äôt particularly stand out from the rest - I would add something regarding the scale of the cases (in litigation involving $X M in the Y sector). Don‚Äôt put ‚Äúreviewed and edited reports‚Äù, which seems like proofreading work, put ‚Äúprepared and contributed to reports presenting ...‚Äù
[22/12/17, 2:52:38 AM] Sush: Good idea! Will add
[22/12/17, 2:53:36 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Projects don‚Äôt seem fluffy (to me, a non expert)
[22/12/17, 2:54:21 AM] Nikhil Dubai: But I would add what exactly you did, maybe. Like I assume the first 3 are created and the last is contributed to?
[22/12/17, 2:56:28 AM] Sush: Ya I added the last one for something outside school
[22/12/17, 2:56:33 AM] Sush: That also I created only
[22/12/17, 2:57:01 AM] Sush: I def need to rewrite the compass lexecon section!
[22/12/17, 2:57:06 AM] Sush: It looks v underwhelming
[22/12/17, 2:58:39 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Then definitely say that
[22/12/17, 3:05:05 AM] Sush: Ok I'll do a serious rehaul tonight
[22/12/17, 3:06:52 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Too harsh? :)
[22/12/17, 3:07:06 AM] Sush: No no! I wanted this :)
[22/12/17, 3:07:28 AM] Sush: I was really unimpressed with it lol
[22/12/17, 3:07:57 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Haha
[22/12/17, 3:08:25 AM] Sush: You've given me many concrete things to change so that's a relatively easy start to make
[22/12/17, 3:08:35 AM] Sush: And I agree with what you say
[31/12/17, 11:42:43 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Happy new year!
[01/01/18, 12:44:22 AM] Sush: Thank you! Happy new year!!
[10/01/18, 3:42:36 PM] Sush: Compass Lexecon made an offer :)
[10/01/18, 4:01:16 PM] Sush: I can't tell if it's a good offer tho!
[10/01/18, 5:41:01 PM] Sush: Ok it isn't!
[10/01/18, 5:41:16 PM] Sush: Who knows what I'm worth tho ugh
[11/01/18, 1:10:55 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Congrats!
[11/01/18, 1:10:58 AM] Nikhil Dubai: What is it and how do you know it isn‚Äôt a good offer?
[11/01/18, 9:23:17 AM] Sush: It's Senior Analyst
[11/01/18, 9:23:31 AM] Sush: They don't have the same Analyst -associate hierarchy
[11/01/18, 9:23:53 AM] Sush: You become 'economist' when you're promoted from Senior Analyst
[11/01/18, 9:24:11 AM] Sush: It isn't enough $ for a job I'm not v interested in!
[11/01/18, 9:27:56 AM] Sush: and there's no travel at all
[11/01/18, 9:28:34 AM] Sush: The only people I'd interact with would be my boss and maybe 2 other analysts
[11/01/18, 9:28:56 AM] Sush: Besidessss i wouldn't be using anything from my current degree
[11/01/18, 9:29:05 AM] Sush: I could easily have done it with skills from insti
[11/01/18, 9:30:01 AM] Sush: am I studying literally all day for 2 years to never use this all again?!
[11/01/18, 11:39:39 AM] Nikhil Dubai: So my flight is taking off now, but this doesn‚Äôt sound THAT bad
[11/01/18, 11:39:58 AM] Nikhil Dubai: I promise you that you‚Äôll see no travel as a perk if you actually had to do it every week
[11/01/18, 11:40:31 AM] Nikhil Dubai: The limited team isn‚Äôt great but I‚Äôm sure it will be more people in practice and, in any case, doesn‚Äôt have to suck
[11/01/18, 11:41:19 AM] Nikhil Dubai: The degree relevance thing, alas, is true for like 90% of all jobs, even for people coming out of grad school, I think
[11/01/18, 11:41:37 AM] Sush: I guess :/
[11/01/18, 11:41:42 AM] Sush: I don't WANT to thoughhh
[11/01/18, 11:42:00 AM] Sush: but it feels crazy to turn it down without a concrete offer in hand
[11/01/18, 11:43:48 AM] Nikhil Dubai: I know what you mean, but all that said, if you think you‚Äôll be miserable, you should turn it down nonetheless
[11/01/18, 11:44:05 AM] Nikhil Dubai: News from trumps America RE h1b visas is sounding a little scary though
[11/01/18, 11:44:16 AM] Nikhil Dubai: But I assume you‚Äôd know better
[11/01/18, 11:44:53 AM] Sush: Yeah :/
[11/01/18, 11:45:19 AM] Sush: ugh I'll apply aggressively this week
[11/01/18, 11:45:25 AM] Sush: to other places
[11/01/18, 11:45:31 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Do that
[11/01/18, 11:45:31 AM] Sush: and buy as much time as i can from CL
[11/01/18, 11:45:36 AM] Nikhil Dubai: How long do you have?
[11/01/18, 11:46:09 AM] Nikhil Dubai: And have you applied to like tech companies and stuff? Because I know some of them do economics/data science stuff as well. At least amazon and google do.
[11/01/18, 11:46:16 AM] Sush: so they're sending me an official offer on monday and will let me know then how much time i'll have
[11/01/18, 11:46:21 AM] Sush: i am doing that now!
[11/01/18, 11:46:31 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Cool :)
[11/01/18, 11:46:34 AM] Sush: my professors also think i should do that
[11/01/18, 11:48:03 AM] Nikhil Dubai: And about the $... how much is it, exactly? (unless you don‚Äôt want to say, of course)
[11/01/18, 11:48:29 AM] Sush: eh it's ok - it's ~ $78k
[11/01/18, 11:48:41 AM] Sush: i'd totally do a job i _liked_ for that
[11/01/18, 11:48:57 AM] Nikhil Dubai: :) fair enough
[11/01/18, 11:49:01 AM] Sush: but it's not enough to be miserable
[11/01/18, 11:49:14 AM] Nikhil Dubai: No, it‚Äôs not
[11/01/18, 11:49:15 AM] Sush: i think they're lowballing me too!
[11/01/18, 11:49:35 AM] Sush: i think i'm overqualified for senior analyst also
[11/01/18, 11:49:59 AM] Sush: they keep saying they pay overtime and that adds up to a lot
[11/01/18, 11:50:16 AM] Sush: but that's not v convincing
[11/01/18, 11:50:26 AM] Nikhil Dubai: They might be. Analyst salaries (ie straight out of undergrad) at Mckinsey are around 70k$, I think. And Mckinsey pays less than a lot of boutiques as well as Bain and bcg, counting all the perks.
[11/01/18, 11:50:39 AM] Nikhil Dubai: They pay overtime? That actually might add up to a lot, no?
[11/01/18, 11:50:57 AM] Sush: they do pay overtime and i've def seen people work like 70 hour weeks
[11/01/18, 11:51:30 AM] Sush: that's what they say - that with overtime you end up making more than similar companies than don't pay overtime
[11/01/18, 11:51:33 AM] Sush: which might be true
[11/01/18, 11:52:34 AM] Nikhil Dubai: You can probably do a rough estimate once you get the detailed offer. And if it adds another 30% or so maybe you‚Äôll find some redeeming value in the whole thing :)
[11/01/18, 11:52:58 AM] Sush: for this - apart from being kind of boring, i think i'm also good at talking about/ presenting my work, collaborating etc - and it wouldn't be fun to be in a job where i can't do those things
[11/01/18, 11:53:38 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Even if you‚Äôre only working with the limited team, won‚Äôt you end up presenting stuff to clients at some point or the other?
[11/01/18, 11:53:41 AM] Sush: plus i'd add more value / do better in a role that's more suited to my natural skills etc
[11/01/18, 11:54:07 AM] Sush: not really - the principal on the team is the expert witness in court
[11/01/18, 11:54:15 AM] Nikhil Dubai: And wouldn‚Äôt any research you do necessitate talking to other experts?
[11/01/18, 11:54:25 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Ah, ok
[11/01/18, 11:54:28 AM] Sush: to a limited degree
[11/01/18, 11:54:35 AM] Sush: it's SUCH a conservative field
[11/01/18, 11:55:12 AM] Sush: they use SAS
[11/01/18, 11:55:16 AM] Sush: who the fuck uses SAS
[11/01/18, 11:55:23 AM] Nikhil Dubai: :)
[11/01/18, 11:55:40 AM] Sush: it literally takes 30 lines of code to do what even stupid Stata can do in 5
[11/01/18, 11:56:56 AM] Sush: plus plus i'm LOVING CS / machine learning
[11/01/18, 11:57:06 AM] Sush: and it excites me
[11/01/18, 11:57:27 AM] Nikhil Dubai: I think that might be worth holding out for, then
[11/01/18, 11:57:40 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Anyway, you have a little time, and now you have a safety net :)
[11/01/18, 11:57:57 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Flights taking off... talk soon!
[11/01/18, 11:58:15 AM] Sush: ok, have a safe flight!:)
[12/01/18, 12:07:45 AM] Sush: Watch Ladybird!
[12/01/18, 2:05:48 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Good? Was planning on it for sure
[12/01/18, 2:06:22 AM] Nikhil Dubai: I watched call me by your name the other day - slept through some of the more intense scenes because I was super drowsy, but overall a lovey film
[12/01/18, 8:17:34 AM] Sush: Oh yeah? The trailer played before Ladybird - I was curious
[12/01/18, 8:17:48 AM] Sush: Ladybird was v sweet!
[17/01/18, 10:17:41 AM] Sush: you're at cheth's wedding?
[17/01/18, 12:19:57 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Nope - Vinay had invited but it just wouldn‚Äôt have worked out.
[17/01/18, 12:20:09 PM] Sush: ah okay!
[17/01/18, 12:20:37 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I just had a miserable flight
[17/01/18, 12:22:57 PM] Sush: oh no! where to where?
[17/01/18, 12:33:47 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Riyadh dubai only.  It too long. But it was an hour late, and they made me check in my trolley, I had to buy food that turned out to be crap... honestly, nothing to whine about THAT much but enough to put me in a pissy mood.
[17/01/18, 12:34:07 PM] Nikhil Dubai: *not too long
[17/01/18, 12:34:18 PM] Sush: Ugh fair enough
[17/01/18, 12:34:24 PM] Sush: ish :P
[17/01/18, 12:35:53 PM] Nikhil Dubai: And I have work to do and I put it off for a while on the flight and then some dumbass was talking loudly while standing right above me to his friend so I decided to do some work and then just then they came and said we‚Äôre about to land so put your laptops away and then they got stuck in a holding pattern for another 30 minutes
[17/01/18, 12:36:11 PM] Sush: üòÖ gross
[17/01/18, 12:36:17 PM] Sush: i'm also a bit cheesed off
[17/01/18, 12:36:40 PM] Sush: by annoying AF students in my new class who want to contest EVERY grade i give them
[17/01/18, 12:36:46 PM] Nikhil Dubai: üòä I feel like a 5 year old getting angry for no reason
[17/01/18, 12:36:48 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Ah :)
[17/01/18, 12:36:58 PM] Sush: aggressive little brats
[17/01/18, 12:37:03 PM] Sush: i mean, not little at ALL
[17/01/18, 12:37:03 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Lol
[17/01/18, 12:38:07 PM] Nikhil Dubai: What course?
[17/01/18, 12:38:16 PM] Sush: Computational Modeling
[17/01/18, 12:38:33 PM] Sush: regressions, applied ML
[21/01/18, 1:55:26 PM] Sush: would you play taboo with a computer?!
[02/02/18, 3:54:50 AM] Nikhil Dubai: I mean, how would that work?
[02/02/18, 3:56:05 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Also, been a while, how‚Äôs it going?
[02/02/18, 3:56:08 AM] Nikhil Dubai: I‚Äôve had a really busy couple of weeks  with work and then in laws on the weekends and now I‚Äôm finally sitting at home with nothing to do. (Deliberately. There‚Äôs lots to do).
[02/02/18, 9:55:09 AM] Sush: Hey
[02/02/18, 9:56:04 AM] Sush: Nice! Have you taken a couple of days off?
[02/02/18, 12:01:20 PM] Nikhil Dubai: No no, just a weekend to chill :)
[02/02/18, 12:09:39 PM] Sush: Ohhh I forgot it was Friday for you!
[02/02/18, 12:09:44 PM] Sush: I‚Äôve been asleep all day!
[02/02/18, 12:09:48 PM] Sush: It‚Äôs noon
[02/02/18, 12:10:01 PM] Sush: Haven‚Äôt read for class üôà
[02/02/18, 12:12:38 PM] Sush: It feels like a Saturday!
[02/02/18, 1:43:55 PM] Sush: i'm in my 3 hr class and CAN'T EVEN
[02/02/18, 1:44:00 PM] Sush: pls entertain me!
[03/02/18, 12:39:55 PM] Sush: Useless üòÖ
[03/02/18, 12:40:08 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Sorry:)
[03/02/18, 12:40:26 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Went to watch jumanji with the in laws and then sheesha with my friends :)
[03/02/18, 12:40:42 PM] Sush: I ended up paying attention üôÑ
[03/02/18, 12:40:45 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Been at home all day today though
[03/02/18, 12:41:11 PM] Sush: I watched Jumanji with some distant family that lives in Wisconsin
[03/02/18, 12:41:11 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Your 3 hour classes must have breaks no?
[03/02/18, 12:41:20 PM] Sush: Yeah it has a break!
[03/02/18, 12:41:39 PM] Sush: It‚Äôs a sociology class and I‚Äôm not used to reading so much üò≠
[03/02/18, 12:41:55 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I liked mine because esp in final sem it meant that I could mostly not go to school for a day at least if I took enough
[03/02/18, 12:42:15 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Is the class reading or discussion though?
[03/02/18, 12:42:47 PM] Sush: Discussion - but there‚Äôs a weekly programming assignment AND a bunch of assigned rewarding
[03/02/18, 12:42:51 PM] Sush: *reading
[03/02/18, 12:42:57 PM] Sush: So it‚Äôs v v time consuming
[03/02/18, 12:43:06 PM] Sush: It‚Äôs Computational Content Analysis
[03/02/18, 12:43:08 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Yeah but that‚Äôs all before class
[03/02/18, 12:43:13 PM] Sush: Yeah!
[03/02/18, 12:43:18 PM] Nikhil Dubai: So the actual class should be more fun:)
[03/02/18, 12:43:31 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I‚Äôve been binge watching altered carbon all day
[03/02/18, 12:43:32 PM] Sush: Trueeee but half the time I don‚Äôt get through all the reading
[03/02/18, 12:43:46 PM] Sush: What is altered carbon?
[03/02/18, 12:43:59 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Me neither but at least in bschool I could skim cases quickly and still get some use from the class
[03/02/18, 12:44:13 PM] Nikhil Dubai: New Netflix show based on a sci-fi novel I‚Äôd never read before
[03/02/18, 12:44:16 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Pretty decent
[03/02/18, 12:44:32 PM] Sush: Oh!
[03/02/18, 12:44:53 PM] Sush: Yeah true! I usually like the class but was just super sleepy yesterday
[03/02/18, 12:45:00 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Just released today
[03/02/18, 12:45:05 PM] Sush: Even though I‚Äôd slept ALL MORNING
[03/02/18, 12:45:17 PM] Sush: oh! I saw an ad for it last night
[03/02/18, 12:45:25 PM] Sush: On the newly released thing
[03/02/18, 12:45:52 PM] Sush: So I decided to turn down Compass Lexecon !
[03/02/18, 12:46:02 PM] Sush: The work just doesn‚Äôt excite me
[03/02/18, 12:46:13 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Ooh nice!
[03/02/18, 12:46:17 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I mean
[03/02/18, 12:46:21 PM] Nikhil Dubai: That you decided
[03/02/18, 12:46:25 PM] Sush: Yeah üòÖ
[03/02/18, 12:46:28 PM] Nikhil Dubai: So what‚Äôs next?
[03/02/18, 12:46:33 PM] Sush: I‚Äôm applying now
[03/02/18, 12:46:36 PM] Sush: Let‚Äôs seeeee
[03/02/18, 12:46:45 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I actually just had a long talk with my cousin who‚Äôs in a very similar position to you
[03/02/18, 12:46:47 PM] Sush: I def want to do something a little more data science
[03/02/18, 12:46:57 PM] Sush: Yeah? In what sense?
[03/02/18, 12:47:34 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Almost done with her Econ BA and got an offer she doesn‚Äôt want to take, so she‚Äôs trying to figure out what to do now
[03/02/18, 12:47:56 PM] Sush: Ohhh
[03/02/18, 12:48:04 PM] Sush: It‚Äôs scary to turn something down!!
[03/02/18, 12:48:35 PM] Sush: My v insightful friend said - it‚Äôs like a fuckboy - you‚Äôre interested because he wants you right now
[03/02/18, 12:48:38 PM] Sush: üòÖ
[03/02/18, 12:48:39 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Yeah but it turns out this is basically a recruiting position, and she wants to do consulting
[03/02/18, 12:48:40 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Haha
[03/02/18, 12:48:57 PM] Sush: Ohh
[03/02/18, 12:49:12 PM] Sush: Will it be a ‚Äòstepping stone‚Äô?
[03/02/18, 12:49:27 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Not in the company, apparently
[03/02/18, 12:49:45 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Problem is she already applied to and got rejected from Mckinsey Bain bcg
[03/02/18, 12:50:36 PM] Nikhil Dubai: So I advised that she try boutique firms and also maybe pwc Deloitte etc.
[03/02/18, 12:51:12 PM] Sush: Oh yeah that‚Äôs a good idea
[03/02/18, 12:51:31 PM] Sush: One of my friends from insti has been with pwc for a few years now and he‚Äôs had a good experience
[03/02/18, 12:51:47 PM] Sush: econ
[03/02/18, 12:52:24 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Yeah? What role?
[03/02/18, 12:52:37 PM] Sush: Senior consultant or something like that
[03/02/18, 12:56:02 PM] Nikhil Dubai: So apparently all these firms hire at Xavier and Christ and everything but not Stephens
[03/02/18, 12:56:06 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Which I found weird
[03/02/18, 12:56:27 PM] Nikhil Dubai: So I asked her to figure out if they were only offering non consulting roles or anything
[03/02/18, 12:56:50 PM] Sush: That is super weird!
[03/02/18, 12:57:03 PM] Sush: also so jealous that she was at Stephens
[03/02/18, 12:57:19 PM] Sush: There‚Äôs this girl in my econometrics class - econ from Stephens
[03/02/18, 12:57:23 PM] Sush: She knows all the math!!
[03/02/18, 12:57:36 PM] Sush: Fucking insti
[03/02/18, 12:57:56 PM] Sush: she unleashed a fresh wave of insti resentment
[03/02/18, 12:57:57 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Lol
[03/02/18, 12:58:16 PM] Sush: Srsly everything was because our profs were way dumber than us
[03/02/18, 12:58:35 PM] Sush: and thought we couldn‚Äôt do math because THEY couldn‚Äôt
[03/02/18, 12:58:35 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Yeah?
[03/02/18, 12:58:56 PM] Sush: For real. All of us had to teach ourselves for after insti
[03/02/18, 12:58:59 PM] Sush: And we all did
[03/02/18, 12:59:15 PM] Sush: So clearly we could have done so much better if we were just TAUGHT
‚Äé[03/02/18, 12:59:46 PM] Sush: ‚Äéimage omitted
[03/02/18, 1:01:16 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Huh
[03/02/18, 1:02:21 PM] Sush: How‚Äôs Mia?
[03/02/18, 1:02:50 PM] Sush: Idk if I told you - a good friend of mine knows her!
[03/02/18, 1:03:12 PM] Sush: She saw Mia‚Äôs wedding pictures or something and saw that I was a mutual friend with you
[03/02/18, 1:03:20 PM] Sush: She asked me when I was in Hyderabad last time
[03/02/18, 1:03:50 PM] Sush: I think she knows her from TISB - did Mia go there?
[03/02/18, 1:04:14 PM] Sush: Well, we were good friends in high school
[03/02/18, 1:11:03 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Yeah, she went to tisb
[03/02/18, 1:11:09 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Who‚Äôs this friend?
[03/02/18, 1:11:16 PM] Sush: vaishnavi
[03/02/18, 1:11:19 PM] Sush: bhupal
[03/02/18, 1:11:33 PM] Sush: she can er, be kind of a bitch
[03/02/18, 1:11:35 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Not that I would know I guess :)
[03/02/18, 1:11:37 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Haha
[03/02/18, 1:11:49 PM] Sush: yeah she was defs a 'mean girl' at our school
[03/02/18, 1:11:52 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Mia‚Äôs good
[03/02/18, 1:12:44 PM] Sush: and i was a spineless cliche that stood by as she was mean to other people because she liked me and i didn't want to rock the boat lol
[03/02/18, 1:13:01 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Her work got a bit more annoying now because they had this big restructuring and most of the more fun people are gone
[03/02/18, 1:13:05 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Ah :)
[03/02/18, 1:13:26 PM] Sush: ohh that sucks!
[03/02/18, 1:13:41 PM] Sush: it's already hard to find fun people to be friends with as you get older
[03/02/18, 1:15:39 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I don‚Äôt think any of these people were necessarily FRIENDS, but they at least made work interesting
[03/02/18, 1:15:58 PM] Sush: fair
[03/02/18, 1:16:15 PM] Sush: i really wonder how many of my 'new friends' i'll stay in touch with post uchicago
[15/02/18, 8:58:13 PM] Sush: hiii
[16/02/18, 3:38:43 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Hey :)
[17/02/18, 2:46:40 PM] Sush: You‚Äôre in Tanzania!
[17/02/18, 11:23:38 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Was :)
[17/02/18, 11:24:18 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Went for 3 days, mia and her family stayed for 2 more. Very short trip but fun :)
[18/02/18, 12:21:11 AM] Sush: Niiice
[18/02/18, 12:42:04 AM] Nikhil Dubai: How are you doing?
[18/02/18, 12:42:09 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Isn‚Äôt it super late?
[18/02/18, 5:46:34 AM] Sush: It was a little past midnight!
[18/02/18, 5:51:47 AM] Sush: I‚Äôm up earlyyy
[18/02/18, 6:18:29 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Very early, no? :)
[18/02/18, 6:27:36 AM] Sush: Yaaa
[18/02/18, 6:27:40 AM] Sush: But I‚Äôm still in bed
[18/02/18, 6:27:58 AM] Sush: I imagine successful people would get out of bed and do yoga or run or read or something
[18/02/18, 6:28:14 AM] Sush: Sorry, by mistake
[18/02/18, 6:44:32 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Meh. It‚Äôs a Sunday. I sleep till at least 10 on my weekends:)
[22/02/18, 1:00:16 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Recommend something beautiful for me to read?
[22/02/18, 1:00:50 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Like, something almost lyrical, but not poetry, but still let‚Äôs you soak the words in
[22/02/18, 1:01:08 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Or makes you soak the words in, I suppose
[22/02/18, 3:42:14 PM] Sush: https://www.google.co.in/amp/s/www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/10/16/funny-little-snake/amp
[22/02/18, 3:42:30 PM] Sush: It‚Äôs not lyrical at all but I liked this story a lot!
[22/02/18, 3:42:45 PM] Sush: I heard it on the fiction podcast
[22/02/18, 3:44:37 PM] Sush: How are you?:)
[22/02/18, 4:00:20 PM] Sush: I‚Äôm going to have a tiny little dinner party
[22/02/18, 4:00:25 PM] Sush: Just for three people
[22/02/18, 4:00:29 PM] Sush: but I‚Äôm excited!
[22/02/18, 4:05:08 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Seems interesting, even though it‚Äôs. Or quite what I wanted :)
[22/02/18, 4:05:17 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I‚Äôm good, had a relatively relaxed week
[22/02/18, 4:05:27 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Who‚Äôs the dinner party for?
[22/02/18, 4:05:56 PM] Sush: Just three friends who want Indian food lol
[22/02/18, 4:06:03 PM] Sush: It‚Äôs just a casual dinner
[22/02/18, 4:06:18 PM] Sush: But I‚Äôm cleaning my house and lighting candles so I‚Äôm excited
[22/02/18, 4:06:24 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Well, I‚Äôm sure it will still be fun :)
[22/02/18, 4:06:33 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I haven‚Äôt ever really done this
[22/02/18, 4:06:37 PM] Sush: ya and I like all three a lot
[22/02/18, 4:06:45 PM] Sush: I looove doing it!
[22/02/18, 4:06:53 PM] Sush: I like cooking a lot
[22/02/18, 4:14:47 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Aww
[22/02/18, 4:14:51 PM] Nikhil Dubai: That was sad
[22/02/18, 4:14:59 PM] Nikhil Dubai: The story I mean. I just finished it.
[22/02/18, 4:15:09 PM] Sush: No?!
[22/02/18, 4:15:22 PM] Sush: the poor little child
[22/02/18, 4:16:12 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I‚Äôve had little house parties before but never ones where i‚Äôve cooked anything beyond pasta or omlettes for late night munchies. And Mia hates cooking so it‚Äôs really just stuff we order or reheat
[22/02/18, 4:16:37 PM] Sush: Ah okay! Cooking is way too much work if you don‚Äôt actually like it
[22/02/18, 4:18:09 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Yeah exactly
[22/02/18, 4:18:33 PM] Nikhil Dubai: And I enjoy it for myself, but only things that don‚Äôt need too much patience.
[25/02/18, 3:17:36 PM] Sush: Hello! :)
[25/02/18, 3:17:38 PM] Sush: How's your weekend?
[26/02/18, 1:39:02 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Hey
[26/02/18, 1:39:34 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Very relaxed :). Saw black panther, played badminton with some friends :)
[26/02/18, 1:41:44 PM] Nikhil Dubai: How‚Äôs it going?
[27/02/18, 5:02:26 PM] Sush: Nice! I haven‚Äôt played badminton in yeaaaaarrsss
[27/02/18, 5:02:54 PM] Sush: I‚Äôm having kind of a shitty day!
[28/02/18, 12:14:06 AM] Nikhil Dubai: What happened?
[01/03/18, 12:27:54 AM] Sush: combination of work stress + PMS + exhaustion
[01/03/18, 12:27:58 AM] Sush: it sucked!
[01/03/18, 12:28:05 AM] Sush: but today i ate my body weight in gelato
[01/03/18, 2:16:16 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Do you also basically mean time of the month when you say PMS or is it like a non reason reason?
[01/03/18, 2:17:17 AM] Sush: No i actually mean Premenstrual syndrome
[01/03/18, 2:18:13 AM] Sush: Often I‚Äôll cry for no reason or get inordinately upset at something and then get my period a day later
[01/03/18, 2:18:29 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Ah
[01/03/18, 2:18:29 AM] Sush: I used to think it was a myth when I was younger!!
[01/03/18, 2:18:34 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Lol
[01/03/18, 2:18:47 AM] Sush: Started noticing it a lot at ~21
[01/03/18, 2:19:03 AM] Sush: Now I‚Äôm up playing with a side project
[01/03/18, 2:19:11 AM] Sush: Without sleeping or studying
[01/03/18, 2:19:11 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Mia has pretty intense cramps which she calls PMS and I always thought that was supposed to mean something else
[01/03/18, 2:19:19 AM] Nikhil Dubai: What side project?
[01/03/18, 2:19:41 AM] Sush: A couple of friends and I are working on a little website
[01/03/18, 2:19:55 AM] Sush: Where we just host tiny data science things we make
[01/03/18, 2:20:22 AM] Sush: Part portfolio part fun part documenting our soc sci in data sci journey
[01/03/18, 2:20:46 AM] Sush: I‚Äôm making a tiny little thing visualising networks etc from WhatsApp group chats
[01/03/18, 2:21:10 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Ooh nice!
[01/03/18, 2:21:31 AM] Nikhil Dubai: That sounds very cool :)
[01/03/18, 2:21:31 AM] Sush: It‚Äôs called Very Fun Data Science üëª
[01/03/18, 2:21:42 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Do you have something up already?
[01/03/18, 2:21:47 AM] Sush: Not yet!
[01/03/18, 2:22:01 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Ok, let me know!
[01/03/18, 2:22:07 AM] Sush: I will! We‚Äôre pretty exited
[01/03/18, 2:22:12 AM] Nikhil Dubai: What are you using to build the site?
[01/03/18, 2:22:17 AM] Sush: Ruby
[01/03/18, 2:22:29 AM] Sush: My friend Haylee is doing most of that though
[01/03/18, 2:22:59 AM] Sush: We just made ourselves admin login and got markdown working on it this week üòç
[01/03/18, 2:26:18 AM] Nikhil Dubai: What kind of things do you plan to put on? Is it visualizations only or are you going to try, like, let‚Äôs analyze this interesting question using lots of public data?
[01/03/18, 2:27:43 AM] Sush: Mostly the latter!
[01/03/18, 2:27:53 AM] Sush: Visualisations only in aid of the latter
[01/03/18, 2:28:26 AM] Sush: Or just fun things like using ML to predict the winter of the bachelor!
[01/03/18, 2:28:47 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Awesome üòé
[01/03/18, 2:28:56 AM] Sush: Ya it‚Äôs been fun!
[01/03/18, 2:29:10 AM] Sush: Have I shown you www.veryfuntweets.com ?
[01/03/18, 2:29:19 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Nope
[01/03/18, 2:29:24 AM] Sush: See!
[01/03/18, 2:29:49 AM] Sush: the data is v old and limited
[01/03/18, 2:29:53 AM] Sush: so try these -  www.veryfuntweets.com/checkup
[01/03/18, 9:21:34 AM] Sush: did you seeee
[01/03/18, 9:21:53 AM] Nikhil Dubai: I tried but maybe it‚Äôs not working properly on mobile?
[01/03/18, 9:22:03 AM] Sush: ugh maybe
[01/03/18, 9:22:36 AM] Sush: look at it on your browser when you‚Äôre free!
[01/03/18, 9:24:12 AM] Sush: so weird it should work ok on mobile
[01/03/18, 9:24:16 AM] Sush: works ok on mine
[01/03/18, 9:24:30 AM] Sush: anyway, not important
[01/03/18, 9:24:44 AM] Sush: I was just saying that‚Äôs the first project the three of us did together
[01/03/18, 9:24:54 AM] Sush: for a CS class
‚Äé[01/03/18, 9:54:39 AM] Nikhil Dubai: ‚Äéimage omitted
[01/03/18, 9:55:03 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Just finished for the day
[01/03/18, 9:55:09 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Some minor weekend work though
‚Äé[01/03/18, 9:57:14 AM] Nikhil Dubai: ‚Äéimage omitted
[18/03/18, 3:39:48 PM] Sush: Hiiiiiiii
[18/03/18, 3:44:30 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Hello!
[18/03/18, 3:44:41 PM] Sush: HI hi =)
[18/03/18, 3:44:49 PM] Sush: I'M DONE WITH FINALS
[18/03/18, 3:44:58 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Congrats!
[18/03/18, 3:45:11 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Wait, is this the end of the year or just this term?
[18/03/18, 3:46:32 PM] Sush: end of the term only :)
[18/03/18, 3:46:38 PM] Sush: and i basically have 2 days off
[18/03/18, 3:46:43 PM] Sush: but i will enjoy them!
[18/03/18, 3:49:17 PM] Nikhil Dubai: You have Monday and Tuesday off? That seems awkward :)
[18/03/18, 3:49:31 PM] Nikhil Dubai: You must have finished last Friday no?
[18/03/18, 3:50:06 PM] Sush: ya i finished on friday!
[18/03/18, 3:50:14 PM] Sush: well i have the week off technically
[18/03/18, 3:50:23 PM] Sush: but the first draft of my thesis is due april 1
[18/03/18, 3:50:26 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Any plans?
[18/03/18, 3:50:38 PM] Sush: so i figured i'll take the weekend off and then get writing
[18/03/18, 3:51:17 PM] Nikhil Dubai: You should find some nice idyllic lakeside cabin to escape to for the week and do your writing there :)
[18/03/18, 3:51:37 PM] Sush: i'm just going to relax here!
[18/03/18, 3:51:51 PM] Sush: my friend and i went on a 10k walk yesterday
[18/03/18, 3:52:01 PM] Sush: along the lake and to a little japanese garden etc :P
[18/03/18, 3:52:02 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Ooh
[18/03/18, 3:52:16 PM] Sush: had a leisurely brunch and a visit to the bookstore with a couple of others today
[18/03/18, 3:52:25 PM] Sush: so i'm just going to relax here
[18/03/18, 3:52:25 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Must still be super cold, right?
[18/03/18, 3:52:33 PM] Sush: it is 8 C today!
[18/03/18, 3:52:39 PM] Sush: it's a _glorious_ day
[18/03/18, 3:52:48 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Haha
[18/03/18, 3:52:55 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Our standards are different:)
[18/03/18, 3:53:06 PM] Sush: two midwestern winters have changed mine :P
[18/03/18, 3:53:51 PM] Nikhil Dubai: In LA I would whine if it dipped below 18. Here too, come to think of it. But it lasts barely a month here so not much reason to complain.
[18/03/18, 3:56:49 PM] Sush: So spoiled üòÖ
[18/03/18, 3:57:20 PM] Sush: Yesterday was like 3 degrees and I was outdoors for 3 hours
[18/03/18, 3:59:02 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Next is your last ever term, right?
[18/03/18, 3:59:08 PM] Nikhil Dubai: How are you feeling? :)
[22/03/18, 5:46:02 PM] Sush: yes it isss!
[22/03/18, 5:46:07 PM] Sush: i'm a little sad it's going to be over!
[26/03/18, 11:17:55 PM] Sush: hello hello
[27/03/18, 1:08:03 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Hey :)
[27/03/18, 9:05:32 PM] Sush: Hiii!
[27/03/18, 9:05:42 PM] Sush: be a good friend and send me some moral support
[09/04/18, 3:32:25 PM] Sush: No one wants to hire me!
[09/04/18, 3:32:36 PM] Sush: You
[09/04/18, 3:32:43 PM] Sush: *whywhywhy
[09/04/18, 4:07:53 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I thought you already had a job
[09/04/18, 5:10:14 PM] Sush: I turned it down
[09/04/18, 5:10:32 PM] Sush: I _really_ don‚Äôt want to do econ consulting
[09/04/18, 11:52:01 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Ah yes I remember. But at least someone offered you one :).
[09/04/18, 11:52:20 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Is it near the end of recruiting season or still early?
[09/04/18, 11:52:29 PM] Nikhil Dubai: And what exactly are you looking for now?
[06/05/18, 1:23:27 PM] Sush: sorry i totally forgot to reply to this
[06/05/18, 1:23:34 PM] Sush: after _i_ started whining haha
[06/05/18, 1:23:39 PM] Sush: but - data science!
[06/05/18, 1:23:44 PM] Sush: how are youuuu??
[06/05/18, 1:23:56 PM] Sush: i'm done with thesis! üëØ‚Äç‚ôÄüëØ‚Äç‚ôÄ
[06/05/18, 3:51:22 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Awesome üòé
[06/05/18, 3:51:53 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I‚Äôm on a project that is turning out to be fairly sucky
[06/05/18, 3:52:17 PM] Nikhil Dubai: It was supposed to be super interesting, and the topic is fairly cool, but the clients are being really difficult
[06/05/18, 3:55:40 PM] Sush: ayy in what way?
[06/05/18, 3:55:44 PM] Sush: difficult, i mean
[11/05/18, 3:32:41 AM] Nikhil Dubai: So, long story
[11/05/18, 3:33:02 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Apparently even when we first started the main client thought the EM was too young or cocky or whatever
[11/05/18, 3:33:23 AM] Nikhil Dubai: (The manager, I mean, the person leading the on site team)
[11/05/18, 3:33:49 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Now, this is ... partially true, but not to the extent that it should matter
[11/05/18, 3:34:14 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Then, they kept being difficult to deal with in a normal fashion and we couldn‚Äôt align on exactly how to do stuff
[11/05/18, 3:34:42 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Now it‚Äôs week 5 and they‚Äôre saying you guys didn‚Äôt do what we wanted, you‚Äôve not been productive enough, we want to pause the study
[11/05/18, 3:35:29 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Which, of course, is a pretty big frigging deal - haven‚Äôt really seen this kind of thing before, although of course I‚Äôm sure it happens once in a blue moon
[11/05/18, 3:35:45 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Not a great outcome for anyone
[11/05/18, 3:35:55 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Aanyway. How are you?
[11/05/18, 3:36:16 AM] Nikhil Dubai: It‚Äôs been a while :). Are you relaxing or recruiting hard?
[11/05/18, 6:05:05 AM] Sush: Let‚Äôs say I‚Äôm recruiting gently lol
[11/05/18, 6:05:20 AM] Sush: That sounds like a stressful situation to be in!
[11/05/18, 6:40:57 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Yep
[11/05/18, 6:41:07 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Where all are you applying?
[11/05/18, 6:41:36 AM] Sush: I‚Äôm interviewing with two companies now
[11/05/18, 6:41:57 AM] Sush: One in Chicago, one in Boston
[11/05/18, 6:42:11 AM] Sush: such a slowwww process tho
[11/05/18, 6:42:37 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Yeah I know
[11/05/18, 6:43:19 AM] Nikhil Dubai: What kind of companies?
[11/05/18, 6:45:20 AM] Sush: Uptake in Chicago does ‚Äòindustrial predictive analytics‚Äô
[11/05/18, 6:45:53 AM] Sush: True Fit in Boston is a start up that predicts clothing sizes based on purchase history and analysing comments etc
[11/05/18, 6:46:35 AM] Nikhil Dubai: I want to do these things :)
[11/05/18, 6:46:57 AM] Sush: I hope I get to do them!
[11/05/18, 6:47:01 AM] Sush: Both jobs sound fun
[11/05/18, 6:47:23 AM] Sush: The uptake data science team is also v active in all these open science communities
[11/05/18, 6:47:52 AM] Sush: I‚Äôm slightly nervous because I got rejected after an on site interview from this job that I honestly thought I was too good for lol
[11/05/18, 6:48:17 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Yeah?
[11/05/18, 6:48:28 AM] Sush: like there wasn‚Äôt a single technical question they asked me that I couldn‚Äôt have answered a year ago even
[11/05/18, 6:48:33 AM] Nikhil Dubai: How much do these guys care about the visa issues?
[11/05/18, 6:48:46 AM] Sush: I mean I have my STEM extension.
[11/05/18, 6:48:54 AM] Sush: so not that much at this point I think
[11/05/18, 6:49:03 AM] Sush: because I have 3 years anyway
[11/05/18, 6:49:06 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Ah right
[11/05/18, 6:49:10 AM] Sush: and they did say they‚Äôd sponsor
[11/05/18, 6:49:28 AM] Sush: Idk though
[11/05/18, 6:49:43 AM] Sush: I wonder if it was a fit thing or something
[11/05/18, 6:49:58 AM] Sush: because I‚Äôm p sure I come off normal and reasonable in person
[11/05/18, 6:50:29 AM] Nikhil Dubai: I‚Äôm assuming the average employee spends less than 3 years at most of these jobs so I guess that‚Äôs really not an issue then.
[11/05/18, 6:50:35 AM] Sush: Yeah
[11/05/18, 6:50:57 AM] Sush: and they did have quite a few international employees
[11/05/18, 6:51:12 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Hmm. Yeah, but sometimes it‚Äôs just very random feelings that some one person has
[11/05/18, 6:51:15 AM] Sush: It was just weird because the interviews were easy
[11/05/18, 6:51:24 AM] Sush: Yeah
[11/05/18, 6:51:37 AM] Sush: Like I don‚Äôt Think I‚Äôd have accepted if they‚Äôd made an offer
[11/05/18, 6:51:44 AM] Sush: It sounded dull and not like much money
[11/05/18, 6:51:56 AM] Sush: but like why did THEY say no to me lol
[11/05/18, 6:53:25 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Lol
[11/05/18, 6:53:39 AM] Nikhil Dubai: My Deloitte interviews felt like this üòõ
[11/05/18, 6:53:49 AM] Sush: Yeah? üòÖ
[11/05/18, 6:53:57 AM] Sush: Maybe they pick up in disinterest idk
[11/05/18, 6:54:09 AM] Nikhil Dubai: That‚Äôs also possible
[11/05/18, 6:58:55 AM] Sush: I actually have a coding interview with true fit today
[11/05/18, 10:33:51 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Ooh. Best of luck!
[11/05/18, 1:20:27 PM] Sush: i hate this one student -_-
[11/05/18, 1:20:40 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Hmm?
[11/05/18, 1:28:03 PM] Sush: sorry lol i'm in a problem session
[11/05/18, 1:39:17 PM] Sush: i just hate them all sometimes
[14/06/18, 12:38:24 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Yo
[14/06/18, 12:38:48 PM] Nikhil Dubai: How‚Äôs it going? Still recruiting?
[05/07/18, 9:53:22 PM] Sush: hiii
[05/07/18, 9:53:32 PM] Sush: sorry i disappeared a little bit!
[05/07/18, 9:53:42 PM] Sush: how are you? :)
[06/07/18, 1:06:19 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Hey! Yes, you did! How‚Äôs it going??
[06/07/18, 1:07:36 AM] Nikhil Dubai: I‚Äôm good - just finished the somewhat annoying project i‚Äôve been on for 3 months. Starting my first study as a (junior) manager on Sunday!
[06/07/18, 2:22:39 AM] Sush: So cool! Congratulations!:)
[06/07/18, 2:22:45 AM] Sush: I‚Äôm just chilling in Chicago now
[06/07/18, 2:22:51 AM] Sush: Enjoying my funemployment
[06/07/18, 3:06:51 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Enjoy it while it lasts!
[06/07/18, 3:06:55 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Any leads?
[06/07/18, 3:39:23 AM] Sush: Yeah, a couple!
[06/07/18, 3:39:48 AM] Sush: It‚Äôs going slower than I‚Äôd hoped but I‚Äôm also being a little lackadaisical about it
[06/07/18, 3:55:11 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Yeah it makes sense to take your time and think this through :). What‚Äôs the deadline before you need anything for the OPT? 3 months?
[06/07/18, 3:55:48 AM] Sush: Yeah 3 months
[06/07/18, 3:55:58 AM] Sush: But I won‚Äôt get my authorisation till late August
[06/07/18, 3:56:15 AM] Sush: So the three months will start then
[06/07/18, 3:56:24 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Ah ok
[06/07/18, 3:56:29 AM] Sush: Anyhow my personal deadline is September
[06/07/18, 4:01:40 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Why September?
[06/07/18, 4:02:56 AM] Sush: I mean, I‚Äôd like to have something in place when I‚Äôm legally allowed to work
[06/07/18, 4:03:13 AM] Sush: Even if I decide to start a little later I want to have it decided by then
[06/07/18, 4:03:55 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Fair enough :). What are you up to besides the job hunt?
[06/07/18, 4:04:07 AM] Sush: Just chilling haha it‚Äôs been pretty good
[06/07/18, 4:04:17 AM] Sush: I‚Äôm teaching some kids to code a few times a week
[06/07/18, 4:04:24 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Nice!
[06/07/18, 4:04:38 AM] Sush: otherwise I‚Äôm just walking around and reading and not doing too much!
[06/07/18, 1:13:44 PM] Sush: If you have book suggestions send them my way!
[06/07/18, 1:49:22 PM] Nikhil Dubai: So we went to Seychelles for the eid break (which is a thing, if you‚Äôre in Dubai)
[06/07/18, 1:49:52 PM] Nikhil Dubai: And I read bourdains ‚Äúa cook‚Äôs tour‚Äù, which worked perfectly for the vacation vibe
[06/07/18, 1:50:36 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Otherwise i‚Äôve been reading mostly science fiction and fantasy (which is the staple anyway)
[06/07/18, 1:50:57 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Oh, I think I told you when I read hillbilly elegy, no?
[06/07/18, 1:51:06 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Was a surprisingly good read
[06/07/18, 1:51:19 PM] Sush: Ohh I want to read that!
[06/07/18, 1:51:24 PM] Sush: I just read Educated
[06/07/18, 1:51:33 PM] Sush: Which is kind of similar in theme
[06/07/18, 1:51:46 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Yeah? Don‚Äôt think i‚Äôve heard about it
[06/07/18, 1:52:07 PM] Sush: It‚Äôs about this woman who grew up in this survivalist Mormon family in Idaho
[06/07/18, 1:52:28 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I thought I told you about reading it and how I‚Äôm feeling like I‚Äôm somehow growing slightly more conservative (in the original rather than Trumpian sense) over time.
[06/07/18, 1:52:42 PM] Nikhil Dubai: (It=hillbilly elegy)
[06/07/18, 1:52:45 PM] Sush: Homeschooled, didn‚Äôt believe in going to the doctor, literally stored up fuel for the end of the world etc
[06/07/18, 1:52:46 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Ooh
[06/07/18, 1:52:52 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Interesting
[06/07/18, 1:52:54 PM] Sush: No, I don‚Äôt think we talked about it!
[06/07/18, 1:53:21 PM] Sush: It was also interesting because idk if I‚Äôve mentioned it but like four of my close female friends here are Mormon
[06/07/18, 1:53:46 PM] Sush: and one of them was actually homeschooled in Idaho
[06/07/18, 2:05:41 PM] Nikhil Dubai: No, you didn‚Äôt!
[06/07/18, 2:06:07 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I had a few Mormon classmates as well, but the one I was closest to was definitely on the liberal side
[06/07/18, 2:06:17 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Aren‚Äôt you watching the World Cup btw?
[06/07/18, 2:07:22 PM] Sush: No I‚Äôm not!
[06/07/18, 2:07:39 PM] Sush: More Wimbledon than World Cup gaga
[06/07/18, 2:07:42 PM] Sush: *haha
[06/07/18, 2:12:12 PM] Sush: I feel like an honorary Mormon sometimes üòÖ
[06/07/18, 2:25:58 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Ah ok. I‚Äôm in a sports bar watching Brazil Belgium
[06/07/18, 2:26:41 PM] Sush: Fun!
[06/07/18, 2:26:48 PM] Sush: I just walked to campus to read
[06/07/18, 3:07:28 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Belgium!
[11/07/18, 9:58:58 AM] Sush: hi‚Äô
[11/07/18, 9:59:03 AM] Sush: *hi!
[11/07/18, 10:03:26 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Hey :)
[11/07/18, 10:04:12 AM] Sush: How was week 1 post promotion?
[11/07/18, 10:04:48 AM] Nikhil Dubai: It‚Äôs not actually a promotion :)
[11/07/18, 10:05:30 AM] Nikhil Dubai: It just means I take on the manager role for this study. If I do a few more and everyone says I‚Äôm a good manager, then I get the official designation as a manager (and associated salary bump)
[11/07/18, 10:05:39 AM] Sush: Ohh okay!
[11/07/18, 10:06:04 AM] Sush: Did you like it?
[11/07/18, 10:06:09 AM] Nikhil Dubai: If I wimp out and go do another study as an associate instead then it wouldn‚Äôt count. Need to make sure that doesn‚Äôt happen
[11/07/18, 10:06:16 AM] Nikhil Dubai: So, I got a bit screwed!
[11/07/18, 10:06:32 AM] Nikhil Dubai: The office is super busy right now and there‚Äôs very few consultants available.
[11/07/18, 10:07:02 AM] Nikhil Dubai: I staffed this one girl but the staffing manager came and made a fuss about how she should do client facing work and not research work (which is what I‚Äôm doing)
[11/07/18, 10:07:35 AM] Nikhil Dubai: So I didn‚Äôt get anyone else this week and they‚Äôre still struggling to find me someone good for the next 3 weeks
[11/07/18, 10:07:46 AM] Sush: ayy that‚Äôs v annoying
[11/07/18, 10:08:21 AM] Sush: So that means you‚Äôre doing it all by yourself?
[11/07/18, 10:08:28 AM] Nikhil Dubai: For now yes
[11/07/18, 10:09:32 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Btw, in other exciting/scary/weird news... we bought an apartment
[11/07/18, 10:09:40 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Or are in the process of buying one
[11/07/18, 10:10:16 AM] Sush: Ooh congratulations!! That‚Äôs so exciting!
[11/07/18, 10:10:20 AM] Sush: Where?
[11/07/18, 10:11:09 AM] Nikhil Dubai: In Dubai, on a new development they‚Äôre doing, which includes their version of the London Eye and stuff.
[11/07/18, 10:11:26 AM] Sush: How fancy!
[11/07/18, 10:11:37 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Lol
[11/07/18, 10:11:56 AM] Sush: Wait you‚Äôre not 30 yet no?
[11/07/18, 10:12:05 AM] Sush: So that is v cool!
[11/07/18, 10:12:08 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Almost!
[11/07/18, 10:12:18 AM] Sush: You‚Äôll turn 30 this year?
[11/07/18, 10:12:36 AM] Nikhil Dubai: I mean, I‚Äôm getting help from family so not really as cool as you may be thinking
[11/07/18, 10:12:37 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Yeah
[11/07/18, 10:12:58 AM] Sush: Still pretty cool :)
[11/07/18, 10:13:36 AM] Sush: I‚Äôm starting to get bored üòÖ
[11/07/18, 10:13:48 AM] Sush: I wish I could go to India!
[11/07/18, 10:14:03 AM] Sush: but it‚Äôs also great to just bum around in Chicago for a while
[11/07/18, 10:14:18 AM] Sush: Esp if I have to leave it üò¢
[11/07/18, 10:18:01 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Where are the places you‚Äôre applying to?
[11/07/18, 10:18:28 AM] Sush: here, new york, sf
[28/07/18, 2:02:45 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Hello
[28/07/18, 8:41:02 AM] Sush: Hii!
[28/07/18, 9:31:28 AM] Nikhil Dubai: How‚Äôs it going?
[28/07/18, 9:33:27 AM] Sush: It‚Äôs going alright I guess!
[28/07/18, 9:33:48 AM] Sush: Some days are fun, some days are anxiety inducing
[28/07/18, 10:28:27 AM] Sush: how are you?
[28/07/18, 10:29:24 AM] Nikhil Dubai: I‚Äôm good... went for a spin class type of thing, now getting dinner
[28/07/18, 10:30:03 AM] Sush: ooh how was that?
[28/07/18, 10:30:10 AM] Sush: my cousin is obsessed
[28/07/18, 10:30:31 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Ok but a bit underwhelmed
[28/07/18, 10:31:00 AM] Sush: ah :)
[28/07/18, 10:31:08 AM] Sush: i haven't worked out in nearly a month -_-
[28/07/18, 10:31:16 AM] Sush: mostly meeting my 10k steps
[28/07/18, 10:31:21 AM] Sush: but nothing beyond
[28/07/18, 10:31:34 AM] Nikhil Dubai: I have, but i‚Äôve been drinking and am generally fat as hell
[28/07/18, 10:31:44 AM] Nikhil Dubai: 10k is good!
[28/07/18, 10:31:58 AM] Sush: ooh i didn't drink for 5 months and i think it helped!
[28/07/18, 10:32:09 AM] Sush: last month was no ice-cream month :P
[28/07/18, 10:32:19 AM] Sush: this month is no fried food month lol
[28/07/18, 10:32:26 AM] Sush: so obvi i can't STOP eating ice-cream now
[28/07/18, 10:32:37 AM] Nikhil Dubai: This feels plenty healthy!
[28/07/18, 10:33:11 AM] Sush: i think even just not drinking beer helps!
[28/07/18, 10:33:24 AM] Sush: but it's a lot easier to do that in college
[28/07/18, 10:33:31 AM] Nikhil Dubai: I don‚Äôt drink much beer but do drink wine
[28/07/18, 10:33:48 AM] Nikhil Dubai: And anyway I think the absolute quantity was the issue :)
[28/07/18, 10:33:58 AM] Sush: hahaha fair
[28/07/18, 10:34:22 AM] Sush: i think i also gravitate towards sweet wines
[28/07/18, 10:34:40 AM] Sush: my wine tastes are like a 16 y old white girl
[28/07/18, 10:34:50 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Lol
[30/07/18, 2:19:15 AM] Sush: I can‚Äôt sleeeeep
[30/07/18, 2:48:27 AM] Nikhil Dubai: What‚Äôs on your mind? :)
[01/08/18, 8:57:30 PM] Sush: partly this job stuff, which is turning out way more hard / random than i'd hoped
[01/08/18, 9:05:44 PM] Sush: i've also been pretty indecisive and probably even a bit lackadaisical in my pursuit
[01/08/18, 9:06:01 PM] Sush: but i'm growing so tired of it
[01/08/18, 11:33:59 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I know :(
[01/08/18, 11:34:18 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I mean, I had exactly the same feelings during b school
[01/08/18, 11:34:47 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Could never figure out why I wasn‚Äôt getting stuff I wanted when others did
[01/08/18, 11:34:53 PM] Sush: it's kinda different though because much like after insti for me, i'm on this path that doesn't exist yet :/
[01/08/18, 11:35:13 PM] Nikhil Dubai: True
[01/08/18, 11:35:18 PM] Sush: right?! i definitely don't feel _dumber_
[01/08/18, 11:35:36 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Haha exactly
[01/08/18, 11:35:47 PM] Sush: i had a great interview last week at this lab at northwestern
[01/08/18, 11:35:57 PM] Sush: and i loved the professor and he loved me too!
[01/08/18, 11:36:15 PM] Sush: but turns out they cant use my STEM extension and seem reluctant to do h1-b
[01/08/18, 11:36:23 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Hmm
[01/08/18, 11:36:29 PM] Sush: i'm v v frustrated and disappointed at that
[01/08/18, 11:36:41 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I‚Äôm sorry :(
[01/08/18, 11:36:41 PM] Sush: because being the right person for the job isn't even enough!
[01/08/18, 11:36:53 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Yeah the visa thing really sucks
[01/08/18, 11:37:24 PM] Sush: idk if i'm going overboard with only looking for jobs where i'll learn a lot
[01/08/18, 11:37:58 PM] Sush: but i'm young and i can make decisions not driven by $ now, no?
[01/08/18, 11:38:06 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Of course
[01/08/18, 11:38:10 PM] Sush: don't i have the rest of my life to do that?
[01/08/18, 11:38:17 PM] Sush: i really want to learn lots and NOT BE BORED
[01/08/18, 11:38:29 PM] Sush: maybe i'm being unrealistic about this also idk :/
[01/08/18, 11:38:52 PM] Sush: sorry i'm ranting but i'm so annoyed and mostly confused!
[01/08/18, 11:39:28 PM] Sush: i'm going to sound awfully spoiled and privilege-blind now but i'll go ahead
[01/08/18, 11:39:45 PM] Sush: i feel like i never get things unless i have _total despair_ before i get it
[01/08/18, 11:40:25 PM] Sush: and i'm doing a decent job of staying upbeat and happy now - so does this mean i won't get it?!
[01/08/18, 11:40:39 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I don‚Äôt think you need to worry about money all that much, but I will say that since this is a new field, mostly, you will probably find something interesting for a short while in a lot of jobs, and all jobs tend to get, you know, boring and tedious in large patches
[01/08/18, 11:41:25 PM] Sush: this is true
[01/08/18, 11:41:44 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I feel like this is a bit of a personal heuristic for you that mostly substitutes for how hard you‚Äôre looking/working?
[01/08/18, 11:42:19 PM] Nikhil Dubai: (Or would be for me)
[01/08/18, 11:42:34 PM] Sush: i have two interviews going on now and another early conversation idk
[01/08/18, 11:42:49 PM] Sush: like i'm being slow and steady about it probably
[01/08/18, 11:42:58 PM] Sush: it doesn't help that mine isn't a professional degree
[01/08/18, 11:43:28 PM] Sush: and also this is absurd and not that important
[01/08/18, 11:43:39 PM] Sush: but i keep wondering if other people think i'm a TOTAL LOSER lol
[01/08/18, 11:46:00 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Er
[01/08/18, 11:46:03 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Why? :)
[01/08/18, 11:46:40 PM] Sush: becauseeee i graduated almost 2 months ago and i'm still job hunting
[01/08/18, 11:47:04 PM] Sush: and i hate when people ask 12323231242149 questions at parties and stuff
[01/08/18, 11:47:15 PM] Sush: what are you looking for, why don't you try this
[01/08/18, 11:47:23 PM] Sush: HUSH I NEVER ASKED U
[01/08/18, 11:47:47 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I know :)
[01/08/18, 11:48:01 PM] Sush: so annoying i know all of this is totally petty
[01/08/18, 11:48:13 PM] Sush: and i'm laughing a bit at myself now but ü§¨ü§¨
[01/08/18, 11:48:28 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I mean, I totally have a tendency to give unwanted advice, but yeah, I know how annoying that can get
[01/08/18, 11:48:43 PM] Sush: i didn't mean you at all!
[01/08/18, 11:48:52 PM] Sush: i mean total RANDOS
[01/08/18, 11:49:10 PM] Sush: i texted you halfway across the world to talk about it lol
[01/08/18, 11:49:29 PM] Nikhil Dubai: No no, I got that :)
[01/08/18, 11:49:41 PM] Sush: ok good :D
[01/08/18, 11:50:12 PM] Nikhil Dubai: All I can say is, this whole process is annoying for everyone
[01/08/18, 11:50:20 PM] Sush: true
[01/08/18, 11:50:27 PM] Sush: and it _will_ suck until it doesn't anymore
[01/08/18, 11:50:35 PM] Nikhil Dubai: And it‚Äôs hard not to take it personally, especially if you have peers who have managed to work things out
[01/08/18, 11:50:36 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Yeah
[01/08/18, 11:50:59 PM] Nikhil Dubai: And there IS a fair amount of randomness to this, I think
[01/08/18, 11:51:07 PM] Sush: yes! of my 4 close friends in the cohort, 2 have found jobs, 1 has a phd admit and the fourth is still finishing his thesis
[01/08/18, 11:51:51 PM] Sush: the guy who's still working on this thesis is not worried AT ALL lol - he's barely started job hunting and he's so confident he thinks i'm nuts
[01/08/18, 11:52:37 PM] Sush: the northwestern professor even read my thesis!
[01/08/18, 11:53:11 PM] Sush: it was incredibly exciting and gratifying to have a person who isn't my adviser read my thesis and like it üò≠
[01/08/18, 11:55:14 PM] Nikhil Dubai: üòä
[01/08/18, 11:57:01 PM] Sush: how are you? üòÖ
[01/08/18, 11:57:26 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Good, but getting ready to get to work :)
[01/08/18, 11:57:49 PM] Sush: =)
[01/08/18, 11:57:59 PM] Sush: i should've asked if it was a good time before going off :P
[02/08/18, 12:01:23 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Lol, I was lazing around anyway
[03/08/18, 3:11:57 AM] Nikhil Dubai: I‚Äôm deeply confused about what to do for my break
[03/08/18, 3:12:17 AM] Nikhil Dubai: I can‚Äôt get anyone to come with me for the music festival I wanted to go to and I‚Äôm not sure I should go alone :(
[03/08/18, 9:05:15 AM] Sush: Come to America üëØüëØ
[03/08/18, 10:35:21 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Too far, no visa
[03/08/18, 10:36:05 AM] Sush: Faiirrr
[03/08/18, 10:37:37 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Anyway, I bought tickets and booked everything today, finally
[03/08/18, 10:37:48 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Turns out like4 other people from the office are going
[03/08/18, 10:38:04 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Two of whom I know and 2 I don‚Äôt really know
[03/08/18, 10:38:52 AM] Nikhil Dubai: I kind of had to force myself into their group and of course I‚Äôm still not really going ‚Äúwith‚Äù them, but at least I can probably hang out with them for a while :)
[03/08/18, 10:39:15 AM] Sush: üòÇ where‚Äôs the festival ?
[03/08/18, 10:39:22 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Does his sort of thing happen with you? It does with me and then I feel like a bit of a loser
[03/08/18, 10:39:38 AM] Nikhil Dubai: https://en.szigetfestival.com/programs#!/s
[03/08/18, 10:39:45 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Pretty awesome lineup :)
[03/08/18, 10:40:01 AM] Sush: I am a lazy piece of shit and seldom leave my neighbourhood
[03/08/18, 10:40:26 AM] Sush: but it totally happens! annoying when your real friends don‚Äôt want to do the same stuff as you!
[03/08/18, 10:40:56 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Or can‚Äôt, etc, but then I find out how shallow my friends circle actually is
[03/08/18, 10:41:19 AM] Sush: And also dispersed no?
[03/08/18, 10:41:28 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Yeah true
[03/08/18, 10:41:32 AM] Sush: Like literally scattered across the world
[10/08/18, 9:30:04 PM] Sush: Hello!
[11/08/18, 2:14:33 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Hey :)
[18/08/18, 7:42:09 AM] Sush: Hope your families are ok!
[18/08/18, 10:08:49 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Hey, yeah, immediate family is all safe
[18/08/18, 10:09:03 AM] Nikhil Dubai: I was supposed to fly in yesterday:-/
[18/08/18, 10:09:16 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Still planning to go on 22nd.
[18/08/18, 10:49:23 AM] Sush: Oh, good!
[18/08/18, 10:49:41 AM] Sush: Hope things are better by then!
[18/08/18, 11:12:39 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Yeah hopefully :)
[18/08/18, 11:12:43 AM] Nikhil Dubai: How are you doing?
[18/08/18, 11:21:31 AM] Sush: I‚Äôm doing okay!
[18/08/18, 11:22:04 AM] Nikhil Dubai: How‚Äôs interviewing?
[18/08/18, 11:22:10 AM] Sush: It‚Äôs weird lol - I‚Äôm having a good time bumming around but there‚Äôs a hum of anxiety in the background that‚Äôs growing steadily louder
[18/08/18, 11:22:37 AM] Sush: Literally the same since the last time we talked
[18/08/18, 11:30:45 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Well, I‚Äôm sure something will convert soon :)
[18/08/18, 11:30:51 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Chin up, etc
[18/08/18, 11:31:33 AM] Sush: üòä
[18/08/18, 11:31:37 AM] Sush: Inshallah!
[18/08/18, 11:31:51 AM] Sush: I just remembered you read the hillbilly elegy recently too
[18/08/18, 11:31:58 AM] Sush: I finished it a week or so ago
[18/08/18, 11:32:02 AM] Sush: What did you think?
[18/08/18, 11:32:36 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Oh yes - I believe I saw on goodreads that you weren‚Äôt too impressed :)
[18/08/18, 11:33:10 AM] Sush: It just annoyed me so much at the endüòÖ it was a good read until then as like a personal story
[18/08/18, 11:33:17 AM] Nikhil Dubai: I honestly liked it, and it was a very good portrait into a class that I just don‚Äôt have any real interaction with, but didn‚Äôt think it was some seminal book.
[18/08/18, 11:33:31 AM] Nikhil Dubai: The end being the more prescriptive bits? I honestly forgot most of that
[18/08/18, 11:33:55 AM] Sush: Agree - the attempts to elevate that story into like policy lessons were so misguided
[18/08/18, 11:34:34 AM] Nikhil Dubai: I don‚Äôt know that I recall any of the specific policy bits anyway.
[18/08/18, 11:34:39 AM] Sush: also the glorification of some violence, no?
[18/08/18, 11:34:45 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Hmm?
[18/08/18, 11:35:07 AM] Sush: Like his grandmother threatening to kill people and beating them up etc
[18/08/18, 11:35:19 AM] Sush: Somehow we‚Äôre supposed to that as heroic
[18/08/18, 11:35:58 AM] Sush: Tbf I probably liked it 3 stars rather than 2
[18/08/18, 11:37:02 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Ah. I don‚Äôt know if it was glorified, per se, but I was in any case not opposed to the idea that problems have different solutions in different contexts.
[18/08/18, 11:37:24 AM] Sush: Fair
[18/08/18, 11:37:44 AM] Nikhil Dubai: And honestly it didn‚Äôt seem that a governmental solution would have been a great idea
[18/08/18, 11:38:06 AM] Sush: I also chafed a bit at the glorification of ‚Äòintact‚Äô families - in a lot of contexts an increasing divorce rate would mean more agency, more freedom, more safety
[18/08/18, 11:38:28 AM] Nikhil Dubai: True
[18/08/18, 11:38:51 AM] Nikhil Dubai: I think a lot of people automatically assume that an ‚Äúintact‚Äù family is intact a functional family
[18/08/18, 11:38:56 AM] Nikhil Dubai: * in fact
[18/08/18, 11:39:18 AM] Sush: True - but that‚Äôs probably a small ish fraction of families that stay together
[18/08/18, 11:39:46 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Is it?
[18/08/18, 11:40:03 AM] Nikhil Dubai: I mean, I don‚Äôt know, honestly.
[18/08/18, 11:40:35 AM] Sush: Yeah I don‚Äôt _know_ either
[18/08/18, 11:40:54 AM] Sush: I wish the book had remained a memoir
[18/08/18, 11:41:24 AM] Sush: the detours into prescriptive policy stuff annoyed me
[18/08/18, 11:41:42 AM] Sush: Like Educated - it doesn‚Äôt make grander claims
[18/08/18, 11:42:05 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Which is Educated?
[18/08/18, 11:42:24 AM] Sush: the memoir of a Mormon woman from Idaho
[18/08/18, 11:42:48 AM] Sush: From this survivalist family that didn‚Äôt believe in schooling or hospitals or any institutionalised
[18/08/18, 11:43:17 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Ah interesting
[28/08/18, 7:08:15 PM] Sush: Hiii
[28/08/18, 7:16:34 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Hey üòä
[28/08/18, 7:16:53 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I‚Äôm just boarding a flight to Delhi and then onwards to Paris
[28/08/18, 7:17:07 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Where I‚Äôll be cycling the Loire valley for a week by myself
[28/08/18, 7:17:21 PM] Nikhil Dubai: A decision most people have found inexplicable
[28/08/18, 7:17:29 PM] Nikhil Dubai: What are you up to?
[28/08/18, 7:18:30 PM] Sush: that sounds nice!!
[28/08/18, 7:18:44 PM] Sush: I got ANOTHER last round reject just now
[28/08/18, 7:18:46 PM] Sush: from Lyft
[28/08/18, 7:18:53 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Ouch :(
[28/08/18, 7:19:00 PM] Sush: yeahhhhh
[28/08/18, 7:19:05 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Do they give feedback/explanations?
[28/08/18, 7:19:12 PM] Sush: they flew me out for 4 back to back interviews that nearly killed me
[28/08/18, 7:19:24 PM] Sush: apparently i wasn't sufficiently well-versed with the PRODUCT
[28/08/18, 7:19:31 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Huh
[28/08/18, 7:19:38 PM] Sush: like, trade-offs making decisions etc
[28/08/18, 7:19:43 PM] Sush: which is fair, i guess?
[28/08/18, 7:19:50 PM] Sush: but like, idk, that stuff is so easily learned
[28/08/18, 7:20:02 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Yeah exactly
[28/08/18, 7:20:10 PM] Sush: there was no ML / data sci in the interviews also which was odd
[28/08/18, 7:20:22 PM] Sush: it was like probability and causal inference which i thought went well
[28/08/18, 7:20:30 PM] Sush: but i guess i have no business sense or something?
[28/08/18, 7:20:40 PM] Sush: but idk that seems like the easiest thing to learn on the job
[28/08/18, 7:20:52 PM] Sush: esp with like specific details
[28/08/18, 7:21:31 PM] Sush: am i just a GIANT loser?!
[28/08/18, 7:21:50 PM] Sush: with a large flashing neon L on my forehead
[28/08/18, 7:22:19 PM] Sush: probably visible from SPACE
[28/08/18, 7:22:27 PM] Nikhil Dubai: More likely they just found someone who did marginally better with things that a couple of those interviewers thought were more important :)
[28/08/18, 7:22:45 PM] Sush: no, it's the giant flashing L
[28/08/18, 7:23:08 PM] Sush: at least i'm hot, i guess?
[28/08/18, 7:23:14 PM] Sush: ish
[28/08/18, 7:23:15 PM] Sush: lol
[28/08/18, 7:23:16 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Haha
[28/08/18, 7:23:38 PM] Sush: some dude wanted to get me a drink RIGHT THEN after i left the lyft office
[28/08/18, 7:24:09 PM] Sush: i was so annoyed couldn't even aggressively tell him off in case he worked for lyft
[28/08/18, 7:24:11 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Some dude at Lyft? I hope not one of the guys who just interviewed you :-/
[28/08/18, 7:24:19 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Lol
[28/08/18, 7:24:23 PM] Sush: not one of the people who interviewed me!
[28/08/18, 7:24:24 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Why not?
[28/08/18, 7:24:33 PM] Sush: i was also just stumped lol
[28/08/18, 7:24:40 PM] Sush: 4 back to back technical interviews
[28/08/18, 7:24:49 PM] Sush: no behavioural questions at all!
[28/08/18, 7:24:53 PM] Sush: like not a one
[28/08/18, 7:25:30 PM] Sush: i was too disoriented to think beyond ' don't be aggressive maybe he works at lyft and knows you just interviewed there'
[28/08/18, 7:26:41 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Ah ok
[28/08/18, 7:27:00 PM] Nikhil Dubai: So are you back in Chicago now or still in... is lyft in sf?
[28/08/18, 7:27:10 PM] Sush: i'm back in chicago now
[28/08/18, 7:27:16 PM] Sush: i got back on sunday
[28/08/18, 7:27:24 PM] Sush: it is in sf, yeah
[28/08/18, 7:30:15 PM] Sush: i mean, i went knowing it was a long shot
[28/08/18, 7:30:24 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Ah, but did you just hear from them now?
[28/08/18, 7:30:28 PM] Sush: but after the interviews i was like ok i was pretty good
[28/08/18, 7:30:31 PM] Sush: yeah i just did
[28/08/18, 7:30:35 PM] Sush: a few hours ago
[28/08/18, 7:30:51 PM] Sush: i even did math on a whiteboard!
[28/08/18, 7:30:59 PM] Sush: which is you know, KIND OF a big deal for me?
[28/08/18, 7:31:07 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Always a power move üòÜ
[28/08/18, 7:31:16 PM] Sush: i mean they wanted me to :P
[28/08/18, 7:31:43 PM] Sush: it's so hard also for me to feel more confident with this stuff after years of being HS in insti lol
[28/08/18, 7:32:04 PM] Sush: i struggle to feel well-qualified sometimes around people who've been doing this forever
[28/08/18, 7:32:16 PM] Sush: did i tell you about the northwestern lab?
[28/08/18, 7:32:31 PM] Nikhil Dubai: The one with the visa issues?
[28/08/18, 7:32:37 PM] Sush: yeah
[28/08/18, 7:32:50 PM] Sush: apparently they might have figured it out
[28/08/18, 7:32:58 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Really!
[28/08/18, 7:33:01 PM] Sush: they emailed today talking about moving forward and how they hope i'll join
[28/08/18, 7:33:14 PM] Sush: i'm like why are you hoping man just give me a damn offer rn
[28/08/18, 7:33:15 PM] Nikhil Dubai: That‚Äôs good!
[28/08/18, 7:33:26 PM] Sush: so idk!
[28/08/18, 7:33:32 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Lol true
[28/08/18, 7:33:34 PM] Sush: i really like the professor and the lab and i know i'll learn loads
[28/08/18, 7:33:44 PM] Sush: but it probably pays VERY little haha
[28/08/18, 7:33:55 PM] Sush: but i guess it'll give me time to find what i want?
[28/08/18, 7:34:15 PM] Sush: ugh should i have just done econ consulting?
[28/08/18, 7:34:18 PM] Sush: but SO BORING
[28/08/18, 7:34:44 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Yeah, and I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôll pay *enough* even if it‚Äôs not as much as you would have made elsewhere
[28/08/18, 7:35:03 PM] Sush: true! it'll definitely be enough for a comfortable life in chicago
[28/08/18, 7:35:16 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Where enough covers, you know, middle class urban living with student loans
[28/08/18, 7:35:25 PM] Sush: yeah
[28/08/18, 7:35:41 PM] Nikhil Dubai: And you don‚Äôt exactly need to be maximizing earning potential just yet from what I understand
[28/08/18, 7:35:49 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Push them to work it out!
[28/08/18, 7:35:52 PM] Sush: true
[28/08/18, 7:35:59 PM] Sush: yeah the professor seems v keen
[28/08/18, 7:36:07 PM] Sush: and seems like he's pushing HR
[28/08/18, 7:36:10 PM] Sush: which is good
[28/08/18, 7:36:56 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I‚Äôd still keep interviewing just because you can‚Äôt always tell with these things
[28/08/18, 7:37:15 PM] Sush: ugh ya i have zero optimism for anything
[28/08/18, 7:37:22 PM] Nikhil Dubai: But at least you have something to think about :)
[28/08/18, 7:37:33 PM] Nikhil Dubai: My flight is about to take off
[28/08/18, 7:37:45 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I haven‚Äôt slept at all tonight and it‚Äôs 6 AM
[28/08/18, 7:38:05 PM] Sush: ayy paavam!
[28/08/18, 7:38:09 PM] Sush: have a safe flight
[28/08/18, 7:38:11 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Haha
[28/08/18, 7:38:21 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Thanks. Gn!
[02/09/18, 4:48:29 PM] Sush: How‚Äôs your trip??
[03/09/18, 3:11:58 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Good!
[03/09/18, 3:12:04 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Tiring, somewhat
[03/09/18, 3:12:45 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Today and tomorrow are long rides - tomorrow‚Äôs a 50k round trip which I may skip, this couple who are on this with me said they‚Äôll probably just taxi it :)
[03/09/18, 3:12:50 AM] Nikhil Dubai: How are you doing?
[04/09/18, 10:17:39 PM] Sush: whoa
[04/09/18, 10:17:45 PM] Sush: did you end up doing it? :D
[05/09/18, 2:02:20 AM] Nikhil Dubai: No, glad I didn‚Äôt - was feeling a bit sick. Did a 15k look to another castle instead
[05/09/18, 8:40:50 AM] Sush: Fun!
[05/09/18, 8:41:28 AM] Sush: I have somehow been talked into trying a Pilates class at 9 am across town
[05/09/18, 8:41:36 AM] Sush: Regretting this already
[05/09/18, 12:03:34 PM] Nikhil Dubai: How far is ‚Äúacross town‚Äù, exactly?
[05/09/18, 12:28:17 PM] Sush: Like a bus and a train away
[05/09/18, 12:28:21 PM] Sush: 16 miles
[05/09/18, 1:43:41 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Yeah, that seems entirely too far
[05/09/18, 1:44:07 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Chicago should have more than one pilates class every 16 miles?
[05/09/18, 9:03:28 PM] Sush: lol yaaa but we had plans after
[29/10/18, 11:18:11 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Happy birthday!
[29/10/18, 11:42:28 PM] Sush: Thank you!!
[29/10/18, 11:42:39 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Been a while :)
[29/10/18, 11:42:43 PM] Nikhil Dubai: How are you?
[29/10/18, 11:42:44 PM] Sush: A v v Belated HBD to you too!!
[29/10/18, 11:42:51 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Haha thanks :)
[29/10/18, 11:42:54 PM] Sush: I‚Äôm sorry I missed it ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
[29/10/18, 11:42:58 PM] Sush: I‚Äôm good!!
[29/10/18, 11:43:03 PM] Sush: I just cleaned my house!
[29/10/18, 11:43:11 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Lol
[29/10/18, 11:43:23 PM] Sush: haha yesss :P
[29/10/18, 11:43:35 PM] Sush: I‚Äôm having myself a little birthday party this year
[29/10/18, 11:43:58 PM] Sush: on Saturday. It‚Äôs going to be birthday + Diwali in my new apartment!
[29/10/18, 11:44:15 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Ooh nice
[29/10/18, 11:44:22 PM] Nikhil Dubai: You moved? Where to?
[29/10/18, 11:44:30 PM] Sush: to the north side of chicago!
[29/10/18, 11:44:47 PM] Sush: oh wait we haven't talked in FOREVER
[29/10/18, 11:44:56 PM] Sush: i joined the lab at Northwestern I was telling you about!
[29/10/18, 11:45:01 PM] Sush: It's been about a month now
[29/10/18, 11:46:06 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Haha yes. I didn‚Äôt want to ask because I didn‚Äôt know how it was going. But congrats! That‚Äôs awesome! üéäüéâ
[29/10/18, 11:47:12 PM] Sush: haha i'm actually glad ‚ù§ i HATED everyone who asked when it wasn't going well :P
[29/10/18, 11:47:19 PM] Sush: it's been nice so far!
[29/10/18, 11:47:25 PM] Sush: how are youuu?
[29/10/18, 11:47:40 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Ah, I‚Äôm ok
[29/10/18, 11:48:03 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Work is going alright although I had a bad couple of weeks in between
[29/10/18, 11:48:29 PM] Sush: ayy, what happened?
[29/10/18, 11:48:33 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Life in general is also ok but some definite ups and downs :)
[29/10/18, 11:49:02 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Work? I got pushed onto a project in a role I didn‚Äôt want, and then I didn‚Äôt do it very well for a while
[29/10/18, 11:49:27 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I mea, partly I didn‚Äôt do it very well, partly other people freaked out so that even the small issues became big issues
[29/10/18, 11:49:44 PM] Sush: that sounds annoying
[29/10/18, 11:50:24 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Fixed it in the end, but one bad outcome is that i don‚Äôt think at least some of the partners involved think all that highly of me, which may be an issue at some point.
[29/10/18, 11:51:29 PM] Sush: hopefully there'll remember more recent successes when the time comes!
[29/10/18, 11:51:58 PM] Nikhil Dubai: So one hopes :)
[29/10/18, 11:54:04 PM] Nikhil Dubai: How‚Äôs the new job, though? Is the work what you expected? People nice?
[29/10/18, 11:54:24 PM] Sush: there's not MANY people haha
[29/10/18, 11:54:38 PM] Sush: it's more solitary than i'd hoped, but i like the work a lot so far
[29/10/18, 11:55:00 PM] Sush: i'm already learning new stuff and there's room for me to actually dive deep etc which i appreciate
[29/10/18, 11:55:10 PM] Sush: i like the prof who leads the lab a LOT
[29/10/18, 11:55:12 PM] Sush: he's great
[29/10/18, 11:55:46 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Nice :). How long is this for? I assume it‚Äôs not open ended
[29/10/18, 11:55:57 PM] Sush: it actually is for now
[29/10/18, 11:56:26 PM] Sush: it's extendable to 3 years on this grant
[29/10/18, 11:56:38 PM] Sush: assuming my OPT extension works out ok
[29/10/18, 11:56:46 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Oh nice
[29/10/18, 11:57:36 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Yeah, you keep hearing news on visas that i‚Äôve basically blocked out, but I‚Äôm assuming the opt extension is straightforward enough
[29/10/18, 11:57:55 PM] Sush: yeah i hope so
[29/10/18, 11:58:03 PM] Sush: there's some restrictions as to the type of employer
[29/10/18, 11:58:15 PM] Sush: but we'll see - i don't super want to think about that till like, jan :P
[30/10/18, 12:00:06 AM] Nikhil Dubai: :)
[30/10/18, 12:07:35 AM] Sush: ok HBD 2 me in chicago haha
[30/10/18, 12:07:46 AM] Sush: now i'm feeling slightly lame for doing NOTHING tonight :P
[30/10/18, 12:09:25 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Haha I didn‚Äôt realize. Happy birthday again!
[30/10/18, 12:09:42 AM] Nikhil Dubai: I did nothing for my birthday either which I thought I was fine with but did in fact feel bad about
[30/10/18, 12:10:54 AM] Sush: i'm going to a jazz bar with some close friends tomorrow
[30/10/18, 12:11:04 AM] Sush: and i'm having a slightly extra party on saturday
[30/10/18, 12:11:22 AM] Sush: i'm feeling more obligated to DO something than actually desirous of it :P
[30/10/18, 12:11:43 AM] Sush: had you not wanted to do anything?
[30/10/18, 12:14:14 AM] Nikhil Dubai: I mean, not too badly, and Mia was feeling a bit down so we decided to make it a quiet weekend, just went out for lunch/drinks. Which was nice I guess :)
[30/10/18, 12:15:17 AM] Nikhil Dubai: I do kind of wish I‚Äôd had, not a big blowout party but time with friends and stuff
[30/10/18, 12:15:27 AM] Sush: that's fair!
[30/10/18, 12:15:43 AM] Sush: it's a good excuse for people to come together i guess
[02/11/18, 11:36:17 PM] Sush: You wouldn‚Äôt be in Dubai around Christmas no?
[03/11/18, 3:58:54 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Haven‚Äôt booked tickets but don‚Äôt think so
[09/12/18, 3:22:59 PM] Sush: Hello!:)
[10/12/18, 3:42:22 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Hey :)
[10/12/18, 3:42:29 AM] Nikhil Dubai: How are you?
[10/12/18, 11:17:32 AM] Sush: hi hi :)
[10/12/18, 11:17:36 AM] Sush: I'm good! You?
[10/12/18, 8:20:55 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I‚Äôm alright
[10/12/18, 8:21:03 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Fairly annoyed with work
[10/12/18, 8:21:17 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Not because it‚Äôs tough, but reviews and everything
[10/12/18, 8:21:47 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Starting a new study today which is likely to be super intense, but at least I get a week for Christmas:)
[16/12/18, 2:53:55 PM] Sush: hello hello!
[16/12/18, 2:54:19 PM] Sush: has your week off begun? :)
[16/12/18, 2:54:22 PM] Sush: going home?
[17/12/18, 3:14:46 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Not yet, next week :(
[17/12/18, 3:15:12 AM] Nikhil Dubai: How about you?
[18/12/18, 12:34:54 PM] Sush: Next week too!
[18/12/18, 12:35:01 PM] Sush: I'm actually leaving *on* Christmas
[18/12/18, 1:03:46 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Ah ok
[18/12/18, 1:03:59 PM] Sush: can't wait!
[18/12/18, 1:04:02 PM] Sush: it's been a whole year
[18/12/18, 1:04:14 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I was hoping to fly out tomorrow but it looks like I‚Äôll be here till late on Thursday/Friday morning üò¢
[18/12/18, 1:04:24 PM] Sush: oh no :(
[18/12/18, 1:04:30 PM] Sush: i'm already soooooo impatient to leave
[18/12/18, 1:04:36 PM] Sush: everything's winding down
[18/12/18, 1:04:41 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Me too
[18/12/18, 1:04:53 PM] Sush: has Mia already left?
[18/12/18, 1:05:06 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I‚Äôm... finding my job much more of a chore these days
[18/12/18, 1:05:21 PM] Nikhil Dubai: No we still leave together from Dubai on Friday night
[18/12/18, 1:05:27 PM] Sush: you're 2 years in now, no?
[18/12/18, 1:05:29 PM] Nikhil Dubai: But I was hoping to get to Dubai tomorrow
[18/12/18, 1:05:33 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Yeah
[18/12/18, 1:05:35 PM] Sush: ah okay! where are you now?
[18/12/18, 1:05:39 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Riyadh
[18/12/18, 1:05:47 PM] Sush: aaah okay
[18/12/18, 1:06:41 PM] Sush: not liking the project youre on?
[18/12/18, 1:06:51 PM] Nikhil Dubai: No it‚Äôs not the project per se
[18/12/18, 1:07:09 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I had a bad review so that‚Äôs one big reason if I‚Äôm being honest
[18/12/18, 1:07:27 PM] Nikhil Dubai: But it‚Äôs also just about not finding this particularly exciting
[18/12/18, 1:07:47 PM] Nikhil Dubai: And maybe a little bit being afraid of stepping up to be a manager which I‚Äôm on the cusp of now
[18/12/18, 1:08:12 PM] Sush: fair fair...bad in what way?
[18/12/18, 1:08:27 PM] Sush: do you think you'll enjoy being manager?
[18/12/18, 1:09:19 PM] Nikhil Dubai: The partners thought I sucked at the basic role on the last study I did, actually. Never got that before. Still don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs reflective and I don‚Äôt think I did that badly, but üòæ
[18/12/18, 1:10:02 PM] Sush: that sucks, i'm sorry!
[18/12/18, 1:11:40 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Yeah. I‚Äôm doing ok on this project but one thing i‚Äôve found is that I‚Äôm actually also much LAZIER/ less inclined to go all out now
[18/12/18, 1:13:54 PM] Sush: circumstance-driven or are you just bored at the job?
[18/12/18, 1:21:47 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I‚Äôm a bit worried it‚Äôs just a character flaw :)
[18/12/18, 1:22:04 PM] Sush: I HEAR YOU lol
[18/12/18, 1:22:09 PM] Sush: if it is, i have it as well
[18/12/18, 1:23:21 PM] Sush: i'm _already_ like er should i just get that phd
[18/12/18, 1:23:40 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Haha I think about that but then feel like it‚Äôll be worse!
[18/12/18, 1:23:59 PM] Sush: but then idk - at school, your life starts over every term :P
[18/12/18, 1:24:10 PM] Sush: real life doesnt give us that!
[18/12/18, 1:24:24 PM] Nikhil Dubai: But not for a PhD no? That‚Äôs a pretty long term project
[18/12/18, 1:24:29 PM] Sush: that's also true
[18/12/18, 1:29:22 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Also - I‚Äôm a bit worried that I am either not as smart as I thought I was, or maybe actually getting *dumber*?
[18/12/18, 1:29:41 PM] Sush: latter is v v possible i think?
[18/12/18, 1:30:12 PM] Sush: but it's probably a function of interest!
[18/12/18, 1:30:13 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Yeah? I mean, yes, but... WHY?
[18/12/18, 1:30:59 PM] Sush: we're on autopilot more often - flex certain muscles less?
[18/12/18, 1:32:47 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Yeah possible
[18/12/18, 1:33:38 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I still READ a lot but although I‚Äôm in a ‚Äúcognitive‚Äù job it‚Äôs really a lot of basic shit and not a lot of DOING different things beyond PowerPoint or some excel
[18/12/18, 1:34:13 PM] Sush: fair...i have barely read anything in the last 3 months :(
[18/12/18, 1:34:58 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Most of the book length reading is fiction, it‚Äôs just blogs for the other stuff, and most of that is just ‚Äúfun‚Äù as well
[18/12/18, 1:36:41 PM] Sush: I just bought a book out of guilt lol
[18/12/18, 1:37:09 PM] Sush: i mean, i was listening to a podcast that talked about it this morning, so i was planning on looking it up anyway
[18/12/18, 1:37:21 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Which?
[18/12/18, 1:37:25 PM] Sush: Wildfire
[18/12/18, 1:37:49 PM] Sush: paul dano made it into a movie and he was talking about the book on a podcast
[18/12/18, 1:38:04 PM] Sush: related - you have to watch the war and peace miniseries!
[18/12/18, 1:38:32 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Yeah?
[18/12/18, 1:38:44 PM] Sush: yes it's very very good
[18/12/18, 1:39:08 PM] Sush: three of my friends and i watched it together last year
[18/12/18, 1:50:23 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Ok, maybe it can be holiday watching
[18/12/18, 1:50:29 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I found the book a bit of a chore
[18/12/18, 1:51:33 PM] Sush: the show is soooo good
[18/12/18, 1:51:40 PM] Sush: Only 6 episodes
[18/12/18, 1:52:35 PM] Nikhil Dubai: And I had a bit of a thing for lily James :)
[18/12/18, 1:52:47 PM] Nikhil Dubai: She looks very different in different photos
[18/12/18, 1:54:00 PM] Nikhil Dubai: By the way did I already recommend a scribd subscription?
[18/12/18, 1:54:10 PM] Nikhil Dubai: If I could get it on my kindle I would be SO happy
[18/12/18, 1:54:19 PM] Nikhil Dubai: They have a really good selection
[18/12/18, 1:59:46 PM] Sush: She‚Äôs so üòçüòç
[18/12/18, 1:59:51 PM] Sush: What‚Äôs scribd?
[18/12/18, 2:00:11 PM] Sush: I quite Chicago public library - syncs nicely with kindle
[18/12/18, 2:02:48 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Scribd is basically like Netflix for books - kind of like kindle unlimited, but kindle unlimited has like 5 best sellers and thousands of Amazon authors who make very specific genre fiction
[18/12/18, 2:03:43 PM] Nikhil Dubai: It‚Äôs 10$ a month and has tons of audiobooks as well, if you‚Äôre into that - has wild fire as an audio book, but not unfortunately as a regular book
[18/12/18, 2:15:11 PM] Sush: Ooh will check it out
[18/12/18, 2:15:32 PM] Sush: I‚Äôm not into audiobooks yet but I feel like that‚Äôs something I could easily take to
[18/12/18, 2:27:30 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I usually find that it‚Äôs too slow
[18/12/18, 2:28:15 PM] Sush: it's irritating to rewind also, no?
[18/12/18, 2:28:16 PM] Nikhil Dubai: And I drift off much more easily - I skim up and down the page when I read every so often anyway, but with audiobooks obviously that‚Äôs not feasible
[18/12/18, 2:28:20 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Exactly
[18/12/18, 2:28:23 PM] Sush: if you get distracted or fall asleep
[18/12/18, 2:28:24 PM] Sush: yeahh
[18/12/18, 2:28:51 PM] Sush: i started doing a coursera class because that's how bored i am -_-
[18/12/18, 4:56:58 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Which one?
[18/12/18, 5:48:14 PM] Sush: applied social network analysis
[01/01/19, 7:31:11 PM] Sush: HNY!
[02/01/19, 1:10:42 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Happy New Year!
[02/01/19, 1:33:18 AM] Sush: Thankyouuu
[02/01/19, 1:33:22 AM] Sush: How are you??
[02/01/19, 5:38:56 AM] Nikhil Dubai: I‚Äôm good :). Working this week, alas. You‚Äôre in India?
[22/01/19, 4:48:13 PM] Sush: I waaas
[22/01/19, 4:48:18 PM] Sush: Back in Chicago now
[31/01/19, 1:43:49 PM] Nikhil Dubai: How cold are you?
[31/01/19, 2:20:20 PM] Sush: Frozen
[31/01/19, 2:20:30 PM] Sush: See my insta!
[31/01/19, 2:31:34 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I did :)
[31/01/19, 2:31:42 PM] Nikhil Dubai: What are you up to?
[31/01/19, 2:32:33 PM] Sush: I‚Äôm at the Doctor‚Äôs
[31/01/19, 2:32:41 PM] Sush: My freaking neck has been killing me
[31/01/19, 2:32:51 PM] Sush: I have early onset old age
[31/01/19, 2:32:56 PM] Nikhil Dubai: What happened?
[31/01/19, 2:33:21 PM] Sush: I had a compression in my spine a couple of years ago that caused a lot of pain
[31/01/19, 2:33:29 PM] Sush: And it went away with a lot of massage and rest
[31/01/19, 2:33:35 PM] Sush: Now it‚Äôs flared up again
[31/01/19, 2:33:47 PM] Sush: And I think I pulled something in my right shoulder on my flight back
[31/01/19, 2:33:48 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Ouch
[31/01/19, 2:34:03 PM] Sush: It‚Äôs so painful I don‚Äôt sleep thru the night
[31/01/19, 2:34:12 PM] Sush: Only time it doesn‚Äôt hurt is when I walk!
[31/01/19, 2:34:21 PM] Sush: And the weather isn‚Äôt conducive to that lol
[31/01/19, 2:34:32 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I‚Äôm not sleeping through the night these days either but I think it‚Äôs just sleep apnea and stress
[31/01/19, 2:47:54 PM] Sush: That sucks! Do you have the machine thingy for that?
[31/01/19, 2:51:23 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Not actually sleep apnea as much as just stress, I think
[31/01/19, 2:51:51 PM] Sush: Work stress?
[31/01/19, 2:53:03 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Yes. Or just work related negativity I guess
[31/01/19, 2:54:29 PM] Nikhil Dubai: How‚Äôs work for you? Do you have to go in when it‚Äôs this cold?
[31/01/19, 4:11:33 PM] Sush: Sorry doctor showed up
[31/01/19, 4:11:40 PM] Sush: I didn‚Äôt have to go the last two days!
[31/01/19, 4:11:55 PM] Sush: Yesterday it was dangerous to be out for more than five mins!
[02/02/19, 2:57:47 PM] Sush: Hello hello!
‚Äé[02/02/19, 2:58:01 PM] Sush: ‚Äéimage omitted
[22/03/19, 1:04:13 PM] Sush: Hello!
[22/03/19, 1:24:51 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Hello!
[22/03/19, 1:25:05 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I was thinking of you, like, this morning!
[22/03/19, 1:25:13 PM] Nikhil Dubai: How‚Äôs it going?
[22/03/19, 1:25:30 PM] Sush: Hii! :)
[22/03/19, 1:25:38 PM] Sush: Not bad! how are youuu
[22/03/19, 1:25:53 PM] Nikhil Dubai: üôÇ
[22/03/19, 1:25:55 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I‚Äôm ok
[22/03/19, 1:26:17 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Work is tough
[22/03/19, 1:26:26 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Life‚Äôs going on as usual
[22/03/19, 1:26:44 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Should move in to my new place soon
[22/03/19, 1:26:53 PM] Sush: Samesies. I'm a little dissatisfied at work and spring is taking too long to spring
[22/03/19, 1:27:09 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Weirdly enough, here too!
[22/03/19, 1:27:21 PM] Sush: Not too hot yet?
[22/03/19, 1:27:29 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Like it‚Äôs not BAD weather but it‚Äôs mildly cold even now
[22/03/19, 1:27:38 PM] Sush: weird!
[22/03/19, 1:27:47 PM] Sush: it's like -1 this evening and it's almost april
[22/03/19, 1:27:48 PM] Sush: -_-
[22/03/19, 1:28:11 PM] Sush: at least the sun's popping out now and then though
[22/03/19, 1:28:21 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Yeah I meant more like, 20 üòõ
[22/03/19, 1:28:27 PM] Sush: hahaha
[22/03/19, 1:28:56 PM] Sush: need. more. seratonin.!
[22/03/19, 1:29:51 PM] Nikhil Dubai: :) me too
[22/03/19, 1:30:05 PM] Sush: :D
[22/03/19, 1:30:09 PM] Nikhil Dubai: How are things otherwise? What‚Äôs with the work dissatisfaction?
[22/03/19, 1:30:32 PM] Sush: It's fiiine only - like i'm the first data science person on this team
[22/03/19, 1:30:45 PM] Sush: so i end up doing a bunch of project management
[22/03/19, 1:30:50 PM] Sush: which i don't really care for
[22/03/19, 1:30:57 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Hmm
[22/03/19, 1:31:12 PM] Sush: and i want to learn from people who know this well lol
[22/03/19, 1:31:51 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I mean, most jobs are a lot more ‚Äúprocess‚Äù than ‚Äúcontent‚Äù (this is work lingo but I think the terms are fairly useful) anyway
[22/03/19, 1:32:04 PM] Sush: i guess that's true :/
[22/03/19, 1:32:13 PM] Sush: it's SO DULL though
[22/03/19, 1:32:37 PM] Nikhil Dubai: But yeah it‚Äôs annoying if you have literally no one who can show you how to grow on what you really want to learn
[22/03/19, 1:33:00 PM] Sush: yeah! i'm also 99% sure now that i'm not applying to a phd
[22/03/19, 1:33:09 PM] Sush: so the pay cut doesn't make sense in that context
[22/03/19, 1:33:44 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Pay cut?
[22/03/19, 1:34:00 PM] Sush: like this job vs industry
[22/03/19, 1:35:07 PM] Sush: there are some things in this job that'll improve my chances of moving into DS in tech tho
[22/03/19, 1:35:24 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Ah right
[22/03/19, 1:35:25 PM] Sush: so i should probably be patient and get those skills
[22/03/19, 1:35:56 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I‚Äôm sure the experience is useful in any case
[22/03/19, 1:36:07 PM] Sush: yeah that it is
[22/03/19, 1:36:13 PM] Nikhil Dubai: It was only for 1 year, right?
[22/03/19, 1:36:18 PM] Sush: 2 years
[22/03/19, 1:37:41 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Ah ok. Do you think you‚Äôd want to leave sooner than that?
[22/03/19, 1:37:47 PM] Sush: i think so!
[22/03/19, 1:37:57 PM] Sush: maybe after i get my STEM extension paperwork done
[22/03/19, 1:38:01 PM] Sush: like 1.5 years
[22/03/19, 1:39:59 PM] Sush: how's Mia?
[22/03/19, 1:42:22 PM] Nikhil Dubai: So another year or so?
[22/03/19, 1:42:55 PM] Nikhil Dubai: She‚Äôs good, she‚Äôs working with her dad now
[22/03/19, 1:43:13 PM] Sush: oh nice! in dubai itself?
[22/03/19, 1:51:41 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Yeah
[22/03/19, 1:53:57 PM] Sush: She likes it?
[22/03/19, 1:54:05 PM] Sush: are you guys enjoying living in dubai?
[22/03/19, 3:40:27 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Well, she‚Äôs learning a lot :)
[22/03/19, 3:41:00 PM] Nikhil Dubai: We are, but mostly in the sense that we can‚Äôt point to anything identifiable to complain about
[22/03/19, 3:46:14 PM] Sush: haha is that what happiness in adulthood means üòÖ
[22/03/19, 3:48:06 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Lol
[22/03/19, 3:48:15 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Are you still enjoying Chicago?
[22/03/19, 3:48:25 PM] Sush: i am :)
[22/03/19, 3:48:31 PM] Sush: i'm VERY ready for spring though
[22/03/19, 3:48:39 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I think I did actually enjoy Dubai, at some point, but am in a more uneasy state now in general
[22/03/19, 3:49:10 PM] Sush: fair!
[22/03/19, 3:49:29 PM] Sush: the thing i dont love about chicago is just how materially the weather impacts your life
[22/03/19, 3:49:36 PM] Sush: seasonal affective disorder is so damn real
[22/03/19, 3:50:07 PM] Sush: why is work being annoying?
[22/03/19, 3:51:34 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I think I mentioned at some point how I didn‚Äôt do so well on one study and they said, ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre ready to be a manager yet‚Äù?
[22/03/19, 3:52:18 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Which was especially annoying because I‚Äôd already been a manager on one study so was fully ready to step up
[22/03/19, 3:52:29 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Anyway, that was like 5 months ago
[22/03/19, 3:53:39 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Then I did another study as an associate and that went ok but they still said, ‚Äúmaybe do one more as a senior associate and take on more responsibility and show you can do stuff before being solely responsible for a project‚Äù
[22/03/19, 3:53:45 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Which is probably fair
[22/03/19, 3:54:04 PM] Sush: you're bored with the associate role?
[22/03/19, 4:02:55 PM] Nikhil Dubai: It‚Äôs more that it‚Äôs time to move on for me
[22/03/19, 4:03:08 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I mean, I‚Äôm above the average tenure and hitting close to the max
[22/03/19, 4:03:15 PM] Nikhil Dubai: For staying as an associate
[22/03/19, 4:03:24 PM] Nikhil Dubai: And it IS an up or out culture
[22/03/19, 4:03:37 PM] Nikhil Dubai: So at some point I‚Äôll have to either make it or leave
[22/03/19, 4:04:01 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I mean, they probably won‚Äôt fire me for a while, but just from a social perspective at work it‚Äôll feel awful
[22/03/19, 4:04:39 PM] Nikhil Dubai: The worry is also that I think they may be RIGHT ie I don‚Äôt in fact have the basic skills/organization needed to deliver a whole project
[22/03/19, 4:04:46 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Which is a doubt I never had before
[22/03/19, 4:05:03 PM] Nikhil Dubai: And I think the confidence boost is making this a self fulfilling prophecy
[22/03/19, 4:10:52 PM] Sush: ayy that doesn't sound fun! i hear you - it's hard to tell what signals other people are picking up on also
[02/04/19, 1:58:49 PM] Sush: hello
[02/04/19, 1:58:55 PM] Sush: I have married person question
[02/04/19, 1:59:24 PM] Sush: üòÇ
[02/04/19, 1:59:26 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Hmm? üòä
[02/04/19, 1:59:48 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Just getting home so answer but may only reply in a bit :)
[02/04/19, 1:59:57 PM] Sush: I‚Äôve been getting along with someone who fairly tangentially works with us
[02/04/19, 2:00:02 PM] Nikhil Dubai: *ask
[02/04/19, 2:00:04 PM] Sush: Ok no worries I‚Äôll just explain haha
[02/04/19, 2:00:18 PM] Sush: And he‚Äôs married
[02/04/19, 2:00:43 PM] Sush: And to be completely honest I do find him kind of attractive and I think he‚Äôs slightly into me?
[02/04/19, 2:01:15 PM] Sush: but I have zero intentions of acting on anything obviously - I would never hit on a married person
[02/04/19, 2:05:20 PM] Sush: we got coffee once - he had some econometrics questions and we ended up talking for several hours
[02/04/19, 2:21:12 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Ok...
[02/04/19, 2:21:19 PM] Nikhil Dubai: So what‚Äôs the question? :)
[02/04/19, 2:24:19 PM] Sush: we got lunch the other day
[02/04/19, 2:24:31 PM] Sush: and he's asking if i want to get dinner now
[02/04/19, 2:24:39 PM] Sush: is that sketchy?
[02/04/19, 2:24:42 PM] Sush: lol
[02/04/19, 2:24:51 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Aha
[02/04/19, 2:24:56 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Er
[02/04/19, 2:25:02 PM] Sush: i've expressed interest in meeting his wife at least twice
[02/04/19, 2:25:06 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Lol
[02/04/19, 2:25:13 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Does he bring her up?
[02/04/19, 2:25:29 PM] Sush: he does, so that makes me feel more comfortable
[02/04/19, 2:27:30 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I was going to say that that likely signifies he doesn‚Äôt *intend* to cheat on his wife, whether or not he‚Äôs into you
[02/04/19, 2:29:07 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Do you in fact want to get dinner with him?
[02/04/19, 2:29:47 PM] Sush: I do I think
[02/04/19, 2:30:07 PM] Sush: I mean I wouldn‚Äôt have thought twice about if he wasn‚Äôt married
[02/04/19, 2:30:32 PM] Sush: getting dinner I mean
[02/04/19, 2:30:53 PM] Sush: I‚Äôm p sure I‚Äôd also just have made friends with him if he hadn‚Äôt been married
[02/04/19, 2:31:53 PM] Sush: It‚Äôs just - I know I won‚Äôt be involved in someone cheating on their wife
[02/04/19, 2:32:08 PM] Sush: beyond that it‚Äôs not my problem to think about his married-ness no?
[02/04/19, 2:32:14 PM] Sush: It‚Äôs his problem or not
[02/04/19, 2:32:18 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Exactly
[02/04/19, 2:35:25 PM] Sush: A friend of mine made me feel v awkward about this lol
[02/04/19, 2:35:34 PM] Sush: Like it‚Äôs something illicit!
[02/04/19, 2:36:41 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Ah :)
[02/04/19, 2:37:41 PM] Sush: So I thought I‚Äôll ask you haha
[02/04/19, 2:37:54 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I‚Äôm not sure I have that much special insight üòõ
[02/04/19, 2:37:56 PM] Sush: as one of my married male friends
[02/04/19, 2:38:28 PM] Sush: but that probably means it‚Äôs not a THING
[02/04/19, 2:38:40 PM] Sush: which I think is what I wanted to hear
[02/04/19, 2:39:15 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Well, my point was more that you don‚Äôt need to worry about it as long as you know what you want
[02/04/19, 2:40:08 PM] Sush: yeah true
[02/04/19, 2:42:03 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Being married does not make you immune from having, shall we say, ‚Äúcrushes‚Äù, as childish as that seems, or even from trying to spend time with people you like all the way to the edge of creepiness; but I assume that for most people it puts a pretty big barrier to acting on them in a substantive way.
[02/04/19, 2:42:54 PM] Nikhil Dubai: If that IS the case it may not be that comfortable for you at some point, but again, no reason to believe that‚Äôs necessarily happening from what you mentioned
[02/04/19, 2:43:16 PM] Sush: v true
[02/04/19, 2:43:36 PM] Sush: Ok I‚Äôm just going to peace out then
[02/04/19, 2:43:46 PM] Nikhil Dubai: üëçüòä
[02/04/19, 2:44:10 PM] Sush: My alarm bells go off very easily with men anyway so I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll pick up on something fairly quick
[03/04/19, 9:52:20 AM] Sush: ‚ÄéYou deleted this message.
[03/04/19, 9:52:52 AM] Sush: ‚ÄéYou deleted this message.
[03/04/19, 9:57:14 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Two deleted messages! What‚Äôs up? :)
[03/04/19, 9:59:42 AM] Sush: hahaha noo
[03/04/19, 9:59:50 AM] Sush: so i was wrong about this situation
[03/04/19, 9:59:57 AM] Sush: or maybe not wrong
[03/04/19, 10:00:09 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Hmm?
[03/04/19, 10:00:10 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Tell me
[03/04/19, 10:00:50 AM] Sush: so we went to dinner last night
[03/04/19, 10:01:18 AM] Sush: and then he was like i shouldnt say this but im starting to like you
[03/04/19, 10:01:31 AM] Sush: i was like er ya you shouldn't say it!
[03/04/19, 10:01:41 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Aha
[03/04/19, 10:01:52 AM] Sush: this is disillusioning!
[03/04/19, 10:02:00 AM] Sush: i don't want to get married if people are going to do this!
[03/04/19, 10:02:30 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Lol
[03/04/19, 10:02:37 AM] Nikhil Dubai: So how strong was it?
[03/04/19, 10:02:41 AM] Nikhil Dubai: And how early?
[03/04/19, 10:02:46 AM] Nikhil Dubai: And how awkward did it get?
[03/04/19, 10:02:56 AM] Sush: i'm not entirely sure tbh
[03/04/19, 10:03:02 AM] Sush: i think they got married like 2 years ago
[03/04/19, 10:03:05 AM] Sush: not even that long
[03/04/19, 10:03:10 AM] Sush: went to undergrad together
[03/04/19, 10:04:53 AM] Sush: i feel bad and complicit?
[03/04/19, 10:05:14 AM] Sush: but it's also not MY problem!
[03/04/19, 10:05:39 AM] Sush: i did get the sense that this wasn't maybe his first time attempting to do this?
[03/04/19, 10:05:53 AM] Sush: he didn't seem particularly tortured about it or anything lol
[03/04/19, 10:07:01 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Ah. So less ‚Äúmy heart is tearing me in 2 different directions, I can‚Äôt tear myself away from you‚Äù and more ‚Äúhey I‚Äôd like to be with you‚Äù?
[03/04/19, 10:10:20 AM] Sush: yeah kind of
[03/04/19, 10:10:27 AM] Sush: his rhetoric was of the former variety
[03/04/19, 10:10:32 AM] Sush: but it sounded too easy to say lol
[03/04/19, 10:10:53 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Lol
[03/04/19, 10:11:18 AM] Sush: and like MY heart isn't being pulled in any direction
[03/04/19, 10:11:32 AM] Nikhil Dubai: üòÅ
[03/04/19, 10:11:57 AM] Nikhil Dubai: On a more general note, are solo dinners with male friends really a thing for you?
[03/04/19, 10:12:24 AM] Sush: usually, i wouldn't think twice about it
[03/04/19, 10:12:32 AM] Sush: i was thinking about my friend uday
[03/04/19, 10:12:36 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Yeah?
[03/04/19, 10:12:39 AM] Sush: we hang out alone a lot
[03/04/19, 10:12:47 AM] Sush: and i've never thought about it
[03/04/19, 10:13:46 AM] Sush: i was second-guessing this because *i* found him attractive i think
[03/04/19, 10:14:19 AM] Sush: or even my friend rodrigo - rodrigo and uday have both been at my house alone with me till like 1 am / 2 am and there's been zero awkwardness about it
[03/04/19, 10:14:45 AM] Sush: with rodrigo it's often been studying but also just like watching a movie
[03/04/19, 10:16:02 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Ok
[03/04/19, 10:16:13 AM] Sush: is it a thing for you?
[03/04/19, 10:16:30 AM] Sush: and by 'thing' do you mean common or NOT common?
[03/04/19, 10:16:37 AM] Sush: like thing vs Thing
[03/04/19, 10:18:27 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Not any more, no :)
[03/04/19, 10:18:35 AM] Nikhil Dubai: By thing I meant common
[03/04/19, 10:18:42 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Not thing as in is this an issue :)
[03/04/19, 10:18:49 AM] Sush: ah okay!
[03/04/19, 10:18:56 AM] Sush: yeah rodrigo and uday are both single
[03/04/19, 10:19:03 AM] Sush: i guess that's a factor
[03/04/19, 10:19:05 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Partly I just don‚Äôt have that many people I hang out with at all now
[03/04/19, 10:19:26 AM] Nikhil Dubai: So - just polled my colleague on this who‚Äôs sitting next to me üòõ
[03/04/19, 10:19:43 AM] Sush: hahaha do tell
[03/04/19, 10:19:47 AM] Nikhil Dubai: She was also like yeah I used to have a lot of guy friends and it‚Äôs never weird
[03/04/19, 10:20:09 AM] Nikhil Dubai: But then also admitted that typically, somebody will end up having feelings of some sort for somebody
[03/04/19, 10:20:14 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Which was my hypothesis
[03/04/19, 10:20:59 AM] Sush: interesting
[03/04/19, 10:21:27 AM] Sush: i feel like with anyone i've dated, i've known within ten minutes of meeting them that it was going there
[03/04/19, 10:26:29 AM] Nikhil Dubai: From what i‚Äôve gathered you‚Äôve actually been pretty good at knowing what you want.
[03/04/19, 10:27:01 AM] Sush: i think so too! i wasn't friends with anyone i dated before i dated them
[03/04/19, 10:27:39 AM] Sush: speaking of, i'm going to siddharth's wedding next month!
[03/04/19, 12:07:15 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Ooh
[03/04/19, 1:23:11 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I‚Äôm bored
[03/04/19, 1:23:17 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Mia‚Äôs on her way to Canada
[03/04/19, 1:23:23 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I‚Äôm going to have a lonely weekend
[03/04/19, 1:26:46 PM] Sush: ayy!
[03/04/19, 1:26:50 PM] Sush: are any friends around?
[03/04/19, 1:27:18 PM] Nikhil Dubai: :( I have like 2 friends but since they‚Äôre both married they also can‚Äôt hang out just like that
[03/04/19, 1:27:31 PM] Nikhil Dubai: You met Jacob at my wedding :)
[03/04/19, 1:28:02 PM] Sush: ah yes I did!
[03/04/19, 1:28:40 PM] Sush: it's so annoying when like the 3 people you know are busy/ away over the weekend
[03/04/19, 1:28:49 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Lol
[03/04/19, 1:29:01 PM] Sush: i miss college for that lol
[03/04/19, 1:29:42 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Scale of 1-10, how happy would you say you are?
[03/04/19, 1:30:03 PM] Sush: fluctuate between 6 and 7 i think
[03/04/19, 1:30:04 PM] Sush: you?
[03/04/19, 1:30:50 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Is 5 neutral or is 0 neutral?
[03/04/19, 1:31:01 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Like is 0 sad?
[03/04/19, 1:31:02 PM] Sush: 5 is neutral i think
[03/04/19, 1:31:21 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Ok. Maybe like 4.5-6
[03/04/19, 1:31:29 PM] Sush: i guess what i mean to say is - nothing really sucks, but nothing is amazing either
[03/04/19, 1:31:33 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Or 4-6
[03/04/19, 1:31:45 PM] Sush: what do you think keeps that number from being higher?
[03/04/19, 1:32:23 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Yeah that‚Äôs kind of what I mean too, just that sometimes I‚Äôm clearly NOT happy, even though I can‚Äôt point to a specific reason why
[03/04/19, 1:32:32 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I mean, I know what my problems are
[03/04/19, 1:33:01 PM] Nikhil Dubai: One is just feeling like I‚Äôm not doing well at work
[03/04/19, 1:33:11 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I‚Äôm about 6 months behind
[03/04/19, 1:33:31 PM] Nikhil Dubai: One bad review meant I couldn‚Äôt transition to the manager role yet
[03/04/19, 1:33:55 PM] Nikhil Dubai: That HAS to happen after the next one but I frankly don‚Äôt know that I‚Äôm impressing the people I‚Äôm working with that much.
[03/04/19, 1:34:32 PM] Sush: that does sound stressful - do you know what specifically they think should be different?
[03/04/19, 1:34:45 PM] Sush: like, are you having trouble *doing* that or caring enough to do it?
[03/04/19, 1:35:35 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Lots of things, actually
[03/04/19, 1:36:10 PM] Nikhil Dubai: One - written communication, my slides aren‚Äôt that good, and to be honest have never been great.
[03/04/19, 1:37:02 PM] Sush: ugh i hear you slides are such a non-intuitive way to communicate
[03/04/19, 1:37:41 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Two, and this is surprising and new and I don‚Äôt know why this is happening, verbal communication: I‚Äôm not structured enough when we‚Äôre having meetings, I tend to ramble, and I‚Äôm getting a bit too flustered every so often. I‚Äôm pretty sure this is tied to a confidence thing.
[03/04/19, 1:39:40 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Three, most frustrating of all, just process management and initiative. Not the most apparent thing but basically, being too lazy or not doing things on time, especially for things like being proactive about setting up meetings or outsourcing tasks and so on. One of the more important parts of being a manager, I think. Somehow I keep letting things slip. I have no idea why.
[03/04/19, 1:40:28 PM] Sush: You were pretty structured and clear when you just described this! Is it a preparation thing?
[03/04/19, 1:42:48 PM] Sush: I don't know if this is an insti thing, but I've noticed myself and other insti folks do this now - that we don't always prepare ahead because we've always relied on winging it (and usually pull it off successfully)
[03/04/19, 1:42:56 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Yeah I realized that as well :)
[03/04/19, 1:43:06 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I think that‚Äôs probably part of it
[03/04/19, 1:43:16 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I‚Äôve reached the point where I can‚Äôt wing it any more :)
[03/04/19, 1:44:17 PM] Sush: i wonder if like talking to a colleague / mia / someone before these things will help - just so you've articulated this stuff before and have something to work off
[03/04/19, 1:44:33 PM] Nikhil Dubai: But that just brings up the question of why ‚Äúpreparing‚Äù is so hard/unintuitive for me
[03/04/19, 1:44:58 PM] Nikhil Dubai: These things as in meetings and so on?
[03/04/19, 1:45:21 PM] Sush: yeah - not in the sense of actually rehearsing it but just articulating your main ideas
[03/04/19, 1:46:28 PM] Sush: this is so fucking hard for me too - i have two RAs now and idk what the hell to do with them - i'm trying bullet journaling - my PI is really into it. it works great WHEN i actually make a list. but on many days, i can't work up the initiative to *make* that list
[03/04/19, 1:47:59 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Hmm. Would work for major things but this also happens all too often
[03/04/19, 1:48:52 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Yeah? I think maybe it‚Äôs just about getting used to it
[03/04/19, 1:51:03 PM] Sush: Fair - you're probably right in that it's a confidence thing - such a vicious circle
[03/04/19, 1:51:25 PM] Sush: Have you tried any of these tracking things?
[03/04/19, 1:52:54 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Not properly
[03/04/19, 1:55:41 PM] Sush: might help?
[03/04/19, 1:56:04 PM] Sush: I think the scheduling part of bullet journaling helps me
[03/04/19, 1:56:17 PM] Sush: because if i don't complete a task today, i have to write it down for another day
[03/04/19, 1:56:33 PM] Sush: so i'm physically writing it twice / as many days as it takes
[03/04/19, 1:56:46 PM] Sush: so it makes for a less ignorable reminder
[03/04/19, 1:58:06 PM] Sush: sorry, i realize i'm being kind of prescriptive and that can be annoying
[03/04/19, 2:00:42 PM] Nikhil Dubai: üòä nah it‚Äôs fine
[03/04/19, 2:01:20 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Tasks rarely take more than a couple of days and the way we work we have daily check ins and check outs where we see what we‚Äôve planned to do and done etc
[03/04/19, 2:01:32 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Things don‚Äôt usually take more than a day or so
[03/04/19, 2:02:42 PM] Nikhil Dubai: The firm is really pretty organized already :). But somehow things still slip through.
[03/04/19, 2:18:27 PM] Sush: that makes sense!
[03/04/19, 2:18:50 PM] Sush: you probably already have systems in place
[23/04/19, 3:33:32 PM] Sush: How‚Äôs it going?
[23/04/19, 3:51:19 PM] Nikhil Dubai: You‚Äôre catching me at precisely the right time to hear another sad rant :)
[23/04/19, 3:51:40 PM] Nikhil Dubai: If you‚Äôd caught me last week I could have shown a happier face :)
[23/04/19, 3:57:46 PM] Sush: Ha!
[23/04/19, 4:00:06 PM] Nikhil Dubai: üòä how are you doing?
[23/04/19, 4:00:14 PM] Sush: I'm a little grumpy myself lol
[23/04/19, 4:01:17 PM] Sush: I'm grumpy about work. Are you also grumpy about work?
[23/04/19, 4:01:27 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Always :)
[23/04/19, 4:01:38 PM] Nikhil Dubai: What specifically are you grumpy about?
[23/04/19, 4:01:50 PM] Sush: I'm just BORED
[23/04/19, 4:01:53 PM] Sush: i hate working by myself
[23/04/19, 4:02:03 PM] Sush: busy + BORED is the worst lol
[23/04/19, 4:02:13 PM] Sush: i could slack off if i was just bored
[23/04/19, 4:03:11 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Lol true
[23/04/19, 4:03:16 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I‚Äôve been there :)
[23/04/19, 4:03:17 PM] Sush: i hate these 'non-standard' working environments
[23/04/19, 4:03:22 PM] Sush: i'd just go into academia
[23/04/19, 4:03:42 PM] Sush: my old job was better in terms of being social but also kinda like this
[23/04/19, 4:03:52 PM] Sush: am i too dumb to work at a 'regular' place???
[23/04/19, 4:03:55 PM] Sush: i doubt it??
[23/04/19, 4:04:03 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Are you completely standalone? No team at all?
[23/04/19, 4:04:28 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Er, I think almost by definition a ‚Äúregular‚Äù place would not require an extraordinary amount of intelligence
[23/04/19, 4:04:28 PM] Sush: there's one other person but she's a project manager + ethnographer
[23/04/19, 4:05:00 PM] Sush: all i want is 50 + humans, abundant coffee and some sort of requirement to look presentable lol
[23/04/19, 4:05:30 PM] Sush: (i'm saying this and thinking about the econ consulting gig which had all of this -_-)
[23/04/19, 4:06:05 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Which you hated though
[23/04/19, 4:06:16 PM] Sush: I did =/
[23/04/19, 4:06:21 PM] Sush: maybe I'm just a h8er
[23/04/19, 4:06:28 PM] Sush: i don't think so though!
[23/04/19, 4:06:35 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Haha
[23/04/19, 4:06:41 PM] Sush: i should've applied to more analyst positions in tech companies
[23/04/19, 4:06:45 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I think I actually might just be a hater!
[23/04/19, 4:07:15 PM] Sush: instead of just data scientist positions
[23/04/19, 4:07:19 PM] Sush: yeah?
[23/04/19, 4:08:33 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I mean, not in a perpetually unsatisfied way. Just in a ‚Äúdon‚Äôt make me work too hard or I‚Äôll get resentful ‚Äú way. Which is almost the same thing for most ‚Äúgood‚Äù jobs?
[23/04/19, 4:08:59 PM] Sush: hahaha maybe slightly!
[23/04/19, 4:09:26 PM] Sush: i wish i was a millionaire
[23/04/19, 4:09:41 PM] Sush: i'd just get master's degrees in 20 different things
[23/04/19, 4:09:47 PM] Sush: 40 years done
[23/04/19, 4:09:55 PM] Sush: *masters whatevs
[23/04/19, 4:10:03 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I mean, you‚Äôd need way more than a single million
[23/04/19, 4:10:16 PM] Sush: okay billionaire
[23/04/19, 4:10:41 PM] Nikhil Dubai: And also unless you had absolutely no one to answer to you‚Äôll have all this pressure to be ‚Äúsocially‚Äù useful
[23/04/19, 4:11:02 PM] Sush: ugh true
[23/04/19, 4:11:27 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I wonder if it would be better if you just won a lottery, or if you actually have to somehow have ‚Äúearned‚Äù the millions for the social pressure to not be there
[23/04/19, 4:11:40 PM] Sush: i think of some of my friends from high school and they're just sort of chilling? learning something here and there, mostly smoking pot and working out lol
[23/04/19, 4:12:20 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Like I feel like if I had been employee 10 at Facebook or whatever and had made a whole bunch, even if I weren‚Äôt super amazing otherwise, I‚Äôd feel justified to just go around traveling and learning
[23/04/19, 4:12:27 PM] Sush: hahaha
[23/04/19, 4:12:31 PM] Sush: that sounds p amazing
[23/04/19, 4:12:52 PM] Nikhil Dubai: But I‚Äôm not *100%* sure that would apply if I just won it in a lottery. Even if it‚Äôs nearly identical.
[23/04/19, 4:13:10 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Ok this is a useless daydream :)
[23/04/19, 4:13:25 PM] Sush: yeah üò≠
[23/04/19, 4:13:40 PM] Sush: i miss uchicago!
[23/04/19, 4:13:45 PM] Sush: i was engaged almost everyday!
[23/04/19, 4:14:11 PM] Nikhil Dubai: With work or other stuff?
[23/04/19, 4:14:21 PM] Sush: (even if it was anxiety that was keeping me engaged)
[23/04/19, 4:14:35 PM] Sush: a lot with work, which i think really allowed me to enjoy my time off
[23/04/19, 4:15:08 PM] Nikhil Dubai: True
[23/04/19, 4:16:27 PM] Sush: what are you annoyed at?
[23/04/19, 4:16:59 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Same old
[23/04/19, 4:17:33 PM] Nikhil Dubai: My manager doesn‚Äôt think I‚Äôm quite ready to start leading a team
[23/04/19, 4:18:14 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Hopefully he will be a bit more qualified about it when he gives his comments but he‚Äôs not going to give like an unreserved ‚Äúhe‚Äôs great‚Äù, which I kind of need
[23/04/19, 4:19:22 PM] Nikhil Dubai: It‚Äôs annoying because we actually did pretty well on this project, and while his points are all valid to some extent I think a different person may have had a slightly rosier view
[23/04/19, 4:20:47 PM] Nikhil Dubai: And I mentioned this to Mia and she kind of blew up because we had had exactly this conversation before I started on this project and she knows I didn‚Äôt put in the extra effort over the weekends to really wow people and all that, which I had kind of told her I would do.
[23/04/19, 4:21:32 PM] Nikhil Dubai: (She‚Äôs a tough love kind of person, which I do *need*, but don‚Äôt necessarily *enjoy*)
[23/04/19, 4:22:08 PM] Sush: ah, that's fair. in terms of both needing + not enjoying
[23/04/19, 4:23:10 PM] Sush: i also do appreciate (usually a few days later) when a friend/ family member will actually call me out on something
[23/04/19, 4:23:36 PM] Sush: it probably helps to say out loud what you _didn't_ do for something no? otherwise it's easy for things to just feel unfair
[23/04/19, 4:23:46 PM] Sush: and that makes you feel loss of control
[23/04/19, 4:24:18 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Hmm
[23/04/19, 4:24:49 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Yes, but for me it‚Äôs also accompanied by frustration about WHY I didn‚Äôt do it
[23/04/19, 4:25:18 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I mean, essentially it‚Äôs just me losing the energy or drive or whatever, I guess. I
[23/04/19, 4:25:25 PM] Sush: that's fair :/ it is maddening when you KNOW what to do but just sort of can't / won't
[23/04/19, 4:25:38 PM] Sush: (i'm kinda doing that right now)
[23/04/19, 4:25:49 PM] Sush: more than can't, won't
[23/04/19, 4:25:57 PM] Nikhil Dubai: As Mia put it, I worry about shit a lot but just don‚Äôt do anything about it
[23/04/19, 4:26:25 PM] Nikhil Dubai: There‚Äôs a lot of fear of failure and anxiety and shame all mixed in there
[23/04/19, 4:27:44 PM] Sush: Have you thought about therapy? I've been thinking of going back for precisely some of these things - overwhelming inertia, action paralysis
[23/04/19, 4:28:41 PM] Sush: I had a neutral - somewhat positive experience with it about 1.5 years ago and wonder if it might help with this
[23/04/19, 4:30:24 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I could, but it sure seems like I just need to ‚Äúbuck up‚Äù, etc
[23/04/19, 4:30:45 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I guess I‚Äôm skeptical that I would get all that much out of it
[23/04/19, 4:31:50 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Were you seeing a ‚Äútraditional‚Äù therapist or doing something else?
[23/04/19, 4:32:07 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I did briefly consider/am considering one of those app things
[23/04/19, 4:32:16 PM] Sush: I was seeing a traditional therapist
[23/04/19, 4:33:20 PM] Sush: it just felt very helpful to talk to someone who didn't have stake in my life
[23/04/19, 4:33:26 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Yeah?
[23/04/19, 4:33:49 PM] Sush: i ended up spending a lot of time doing 'cultural translation'
[23/04/19, 4:34:00 PM] Sush: which i think prevented it from being as helpful as it could've been
[23/04/19, 4:34:17 PM] Nikhil Dubai: :) sounds likely
[23/04/19, 4:35:13 PM] Sush: i think the most important thing i maybe got out of it was my antidepressant haha
[23/04/19, 4:35:36 PM] Sush: no i'm being facetious
[23/04/19, 4:36:11 PM] Sush: i think it's pretty huge to have a space where you can just say some things out loud and there's no fear of judgement / disappointing someone
[23/04/19, 4:36:49 PM] Sush: i think it helped me be more honest about why i didn't want to do some things
[23/04/19, 4:37:37 PM] Sush: i've also seen it kind of devolve into a blind validation receiving space though
[23/04/19, 4:37:55 PM] Sush: a friend of mine has a therapist that sounds like the most enabling person
[23/04/19, 4:38:20 PM] Sush: either she's not honest with me about what her therapist says (which is fine) or she's not honest with her therapist or her therapist is bad
[23/04/19, 4:39:08 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Yeah I guess it probably really depends on the therapist and also how you approach it
[23/04/19, 4:39:27 PM] Sush: Yeah
[23/04/19, 4:39:43 PM] Sush: Like they say the work‚Äôs only ‚Äòplanned‚Äô in therapy, it starts after
[23/04/19, 4:42:46 PM] Sush: there's also probably some placebo type effect where you're more conscious of some things and get more deliberate about responding to patterns
[23/04/19, 4:42:54 PM] Nikhil Dubai: The very word ‚Äúwork‚Äù is making me have an adverse reaction now :)
[23/04/19, 4:43:00 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Hmm?
[23/04/19, 4:43:06 PM] Sush: ayy sorry :)
[23/04/19, 4:43:29 PM] Sush: because you're talking about patterns, you're more attuned to them
[23/04/19, 4:44:02 PM] Sush: i think it definitely helped me learn to check obsessive thought patterns
[23/04/19, 4:44:27 PM] Sush: i got better and knowing when i was about to spiral and then try and do something about it (usually distract myself)
[23/04/19, 4:45:35 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Ah
[23/04/19, 4:46:18 PM] Sush: i hope i haven't put you off the idea haha
[23/04/19, 4:47:47 PM] Nikhil Dubai: It wasn‚Äôt really an idea I was considering that strongly, but it‚Äôs still in the running :)
[23/04/19, 4:48:37 PM] Sush: :)
[23/04/19, 4:51:08 PM] Sush: i'm doing a talk on saturday
[23/04/19, 4:51:14 PM] Sush: and being _terrible_ about preparing for it
[23/04/19, 4:51:22 PM] Sush: i knew it was happening a month  ago
[23/04/19, 4:51:29 PM] Sush: and have basically nothing about it
[23/04/19, 4:51:32 PM] Sush: *done
[23/04/19, 4:51:33 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Talk on what?
[23/04/19, 4:51:42 PM] Sush: it's at an R user conference
[23/04/19, 4:51:49 PM] Sush: how to do machine learning with imbalanced classes
[23/04/19, 4:53:01 PM] Nikhil Dubai: That sounds interesting and complicated?
[23/04/19, 4:53:16 PM] Sush: it actually is interesting!
[23/04/19, 4:53:21 PM] Sush: it's what i did for my thesis
[23/04/19, 4:53:52 PM] Sush: it makes me nervous to assert authority in this space lol
[23/04/19, 4:54:11 PM] Sush: i'm in the 'statistical methods' session which i think is wild and absurd
[23/04/19, 4:54:22 PM] Nikhil Dubai: But presumably if it was your thesis you‚Äôve given some version of this already no? :)
[23/04/19, 4:54:43 PM] Sush: yeah! it was mostly focused on the findings though
[23/04/19, 4:54:55 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Ah right
[23/04/19, 4:55:04 PM] Sush: i just sort of described why i picked the method i used
[23/04/19, 4:55:11 PM] Sush: rather than go over a bunch of methods
[23/04/19, 4:57:35 PM] Nikhil Dubai: So do you need to prep a lot or is this just throwing some slides together?
[23/04/19, 4:57:51 PM] Sush: it needs to be pretty tight
[23/04/19, 4:57:59 PM] Sush: a lot of the chicago data science community will be there
[23/04/19, 4:58:14 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Ah
[23/04/19, 4:58:18 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Best of luck!
[23/04/19, 4:58:25 PM] Sush: it's a good place to sort of be seen as a smart and competent person haha
[23/04/19, 4:58:41 PM] Sush: i wouldn't want to convey the impression of half-assing it
[23/04/19, 4:58:45 PM] Sush: thank you!
[23/04/19, 4:59:05 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Of course, makes sense
[23/04/19, 4:59:48 PM] Nikhil Dubai: How long is it? Is it several talks together or a panel or a full solo session?
[23/04/19, 5:00:03 PM] Sush: so the conference is a day long
[23/04/19, 5:00:20 PM] Sush: the statistical methods session is 4 20-minute talks
[23/04/19, 5:00:42 PM] Nikhil Dubai: 20 minutes is pretty long!
[23/04/19, 5:00:49 PM] Sush: no????
[23/04/19, 5:00:51 PM] Sush: i agree
[23/04/19, 5:00:58 PM] Sush: all i've done is make some gifs
[23/04/19, 5:01:06 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Lol
[23/04/19, 5:01:38 PM] Sush: to illustrate some methods lol
[23/04/19, 5:01:54 PM] Sush: i love gifs that show like updated learning type things
[23/04/19, 5:02:00 PM] Sush: or just any iterative processes
[23/04/19, 5:02:21 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Yeah?
[23/04/19, 5:02:44 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Send one
[23/04/19, 5:03:48 PM] Sush: it won't let me send a gif on whatsapp wtf
[23/04/19, 5:06:05 PM] Sush: i just want to feel satisfied when it's done!
[23/04/19, 5:06:16 PM] Sush: and have it be smooth and actually useful to people who listen
[23/04/19, 5:06:50 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll be good :)
[23/04/19, 5:07:04 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Did you have time off for Easter?
[23/04/19, 5:07:18 PM] Sush: No :(
[23/04/19, 5:07:32 PM] Sush: we didn't even have good friday off which i thought was odd
[23/04/19, 5:07:39 PM] Sush: and didnt at UofC either
[23/04/19, 5:07:44 PM] Sush: inshallah!
[23/04/19, 5:08:35 PM] Nikhil Dubai: That is surprising
[23/04/19, 5:09:21 PM] Sush: Did you guys get time off?
[23/04/19, 5:13:10 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I took a day since the project was just winding down, but it wasn‚Äôt a public holiday
[23/04/19, 5:15:50 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Ok, I‚Äôm off to bed
[23/04/19, 5:16:00 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Off to sleep I guess since i‚Äôve been in bed for a bit
[26/04/19, 7:55:35 AM] Sush: Last week on the red line- can you move your bag so I can see your tits?
[26/04/19, 7:55:45 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Wow
[26/04/19, 7:56:09 AM] Sush: one dude asked me out three times and I said no politely and then asked me to take off my gloves to prove I was married
[26/04/19, 7:56:33 AM] Sush: another dude asked me if he could fuck me and followed me around
[26/04/19, 7:56:44 AM] Sush: All in broad daylight!
[26/04/19, 7:56:51 AM] Nikhil Dubai: I‚Äôve never claimed to be super woke, but I still think I‚Äôm ‚Äúin the loop‚Äù, but every now and then I realize that there‚Äôs so much of this shit going on that I don‚Äôt even have to think about
[26/04/19, 7:57:27 AM] Nikhil Dubai: That sounds awful
[26/04/19, 7:57:54 AM] Sush: I think part of that is we just don‚Äôt talk about it that much + use public transport way more in the US than at home
[26/04/19, 7:59:19 AM] Nikhil Dubai: I mean, i do HEAR about women complaining about harassment on public transport, but rarely stop to think about what that means, I guess
[26/04/19, 7:59:20 AM] Sush: ie the reason a lot of well meaning men don‚Äôt realise
[26/04/19, 7:59:47 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Also yeah, I don‚Äôt think i‚Äôve actually used public transport in ages
[26/04/19, 7:59:55 AM] Sush: this was in the middle of afternoon trying to get to a meeting
[26/04/19, 8:00:00 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Other than on vacation
[26/04/19, 8:00:01 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Fuck
[26/04/19, 8:00:05 AM] Sush: Threw me off my game for some time
[26/04/19, 8:00:13 AM] Nikhil Dubai: I can imagine
[26/04/19, 8:00:45 AM] Sush: plus it‚Äôs chicago I‚Äôm always like cool he probably has a gun this is how I go
[26/04/19, 8:01:26 AM] Sush: my friend Erin and I saw a fight break out last month complete with a knife and threats to kill etc
[26/04/19, 8:01:27 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Oh god yes. I forgot that about the US
[26/04/19, 8:02:11 AM] Nikhil Dubai: So one thing about living in Dubai is that, on the one hand, it‚Äôs obviously an outrageously sexist society
[26/04/19, 8:02:33 AM] Nikhil Dubai: On the other hand, it‚Äôs like absurdly safe (as far as I can tell)
[26/04/19, 8:02:44 AM] Sush: So I‚Äôve heard!
[26/04/19, 8:03:21 AM] Sush: Yeah when people try to say like separate women‚Äôs compartments in the metro is regressive etc
[26/04/19, 8:03:30 AM] Sush: I‚Äôm like PLS GIVE IT TO ME
[26/04/19, 8:03:38 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Lol
[26/04/19, 8:03:49 AM] Nikhil Dubai: They have that in most indian cities no?
[26/04/19, 8:03:57 AM] Sush: yeah they do thank god
[26/04/19, 8:04:32 AM] Sush: but this also gets annoying why don‚Äôt account for demand
[26/04/19, 8:04:41 AM] Sush: Like airport security lines in the Bangalore airport
[26/04/19, 8:04:56 AM] Sush: fucking nuisance
[26/04/19, 8:05:05 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Hmm?
[26/04/19, 8:05:11 AM] Sush: They have like 3 lines for women and 15 for men
[26/04/19, 8:05:31 AM] Sush: and the gender ratio of their footfall is NOT proportionate
[26/04/19, 8:05:54 AM] Sush: Women‚Äôs lines are always suuuuper long with half the men‚Äôs lines just being empty
[26/04/19, 8:06:12 AM] Sush: It‚Äôs only a metal detector also I don‚Äôt really care who wields it
[26/04/19, 8:06:15 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Huh. Most places i‚Äôve been the women‚Äôs queues were, if anything, more lightly trafficked. But that‚Äôs in the Middle East.
[26/04/19, 8:06:40 AM] Sush: I guess Bangalore is also a specific example
[26/04/19, 8:06:54 AM] Sush: Have noticed it in the mornings in Chennai
[26/04/19, 8:07:43 AM] Sush: my fav is these insti boys who think we shouldn‚Äôt have had gender segregated dorms
[26/04/19, 8:07:48 AM] Sush: NO THANK U
[26/04/19, 8:07:56 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Haha
[26/04/19, 8:09:25 AM] Nikhil Dubai: So I am currently simultaneously obsessed with both Ezra Furman and George Ezra
[26/04/19, 8:09:51 AM] Sush: Who are they?
[26/04/19, 8:10:31 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Musicians
[26/04/19, 8:11:02 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Fairly different actually but if I put a mix on YouTube from one I still end up getting both due to how the algorithm works, weirdly :)
[26/04/19, 8:11:28 AM] Nikhil Dubai: I don‚Äôt know if you like this kind of music at all but it‚Äôs still a fun video:

https://youtu.be/ZS0WvzRVByg
[26/04/19, 8:11:29 AM] Sush: Send me a song!
[26/04/19, 8:11:45 AM] Sush: About to get on a long Uber ride lol
[26/04/19, 8:12:23 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Look for ‚Äúmy hero‚Äù by Ezra furman and ‚Äúshotgun‚Äù by george Ezra
[26/04/19, 9:38:35 AM] Sush: i like this a lot!
[08/05/19, 9:05:16 AM] Sush: Found this looking for something else loll
‚Äé[08/05/19, 9:05:27 AM] Sush: ‚Äéimage omitted
[08/05/19, 9:16:09 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Haha
[08/05/19, 9:16:16 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Wow, 2013!
[08/05/19, 11:46:26 AM] Sush: yeah :P
[08/05/19, 11:46:33 AM] Sush: when we are TINY
[08/05/19, 11:49:50 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Do you like who you are today better than who you were in 2013?
[08/05/19, 11:50:09 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Sorry, too deep too soon, but just thought about it
[08/05/19, 12:21:51 PM] Sush: ugh i'm trying to remember who i was in 2013
[08/05/19, 12:22:08 PM] Sush: 4th/5th year of insti
[08/05/19, 12:22:15 PM] Sush: i like who i am today better!
[08/05/19, 12:22:16 PM] Sush: you?
[08/05/19, 1:31:41 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I think I‚Äôm a better person now and I‚Äôm probably about as happy if not slightly better, but I feel weirdly sluggish sometimes. Like a loss of vitality, or something.
[08/05/19, 1:33:31 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I had to wait 20 minutes in line because the online check in didn‚Äôt work and now this flight is delayed again
[08/05/19, 5:21:06 PM] Sush: i actually feel a bit more energetic now. i'm def more engaged in my work than i was then (even though i complain about my work now) EVERYTHING hurts more though lol
[08/05/19, 7:37:07 PM] Sush: everything = neck and back mostly lol
[08/05/19, 7:37:28 PM] Sush: were you in schlumberger?
[09/05/19, 12:36:07 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Actually, I guess engagement is actually higher for me too, despite the bitching
[09/05/19, 12:36:31 AM] Nikhil Dubai: I mean, I‚Äôm complaining a lot but schlumberger as you just reminded me was way worse :)
[09/05/19, 12:37:59 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Although it was definitely ‚Äúsimpler‚Äù, both in terms of intellectual effort required for the job (which is not a good thing) and just the general extra effort needed for career management, networking, etc at McKinsey (which does get stressful for me)
[09/05/19, 12:33:33 PM] Sush: hahaha
[09/05/19, 12:33:46 PM] Sush: yeahhh the stakes for everything were lower in 2013 i guess
[09/05/19, 12:34:05 PM] Sush: and there's just slightly less anxiety over WHO AM I
[09/05/19, 12:34:19 PM] Sush: not that i know better, but that i'm a little more ok with not knowing
[09/05/19, 12:34:44 PM] Nikhil Dubai: You have slightly less anxiety over it now you mean?
[09/05/19, 12:34:51 PM] Sush: yes
[09/05/19, 12:35:16 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I actually had this sense of ‚ÄúI could be so many more things‚Äù that was fairly exhilarating
[09/05/19, 12:35:39 PM] Sush: hmm that's fair!
[09/05/19, 12:35:54 PM] Sush: i have more of that now - but that's mostly because my second degree was way better for me
[09/05/19, 12:35:58 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Right now I just feel ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a 30 year old consultant who doesn‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs doing next‚Äù and that‚Äôs just a cliche
[09/05/19, 12:37:01 PM] Sush: that's reasonable!
[09/05/19, 12:37:21 PM] Sush: idk if this is good or bad but when i plan for my life i feel like i'm still 25 :/v
[09/05/19, 12:37:59 PM] Sush: wait do you turn 30 this year or did you turn 30 last year?
[09/05/19, 12:48:37 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I am already 30
[09/05/19, 12:48:56 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I think it‚Äôs good and it‚Äôs not as if 30 is, in fact, old, really
[09/05/19, 12:49:03 PM] Sush: you graduated end of my 2nd year no?
[09/05/19, 12:49:04 PM] Sush: yeah
[09/05/19, 12:49:09 PM] Nikhil Dubai: It‚Äôs more this mental feeling locked down thing
[09/05/19, 12:49:26 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Yeah I think so
[09/05/19, 12:49:43 PM] Sush: fair
[09/05/19, 12:49:49 PM] Sush: i also do feel that sometimes
[09/05/19, 12:51:46 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I feel like I‚Äôve had this conversation before :)
[09/05/19, 12:52:01 PM] Sush: Lol
[09/05/19, 12:52:05 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I also have a tendency to blame it on my marriage which even I recognize as being very unfair
[09/05/19, 12:52:54 PM] Sush: It‚Äôs probably the institution rather than your specific marriage no
[09/05/19, 12:56:05 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I mean, sure
[09/05/19, 1:02:41 PM] Sush: I still want to get a PhD maybe :/
[09/05/19, 1:03:16 PM] Sush: Also!
[09/05/19, 1:03:27 PM] Sush: Remember the married person?
[09/05/19, 1:03:33 PM] Sush: He applied to work at my lab
[09/05/19, 1:03:43 PM] Sush: Which made me feel super weird
[09/05/19, 1:03:51 PM] Sush: Thankfully my prof was like lol no
[09/05/19, 1:10:30 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Haha
[09/05/19, 1:10:32 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Because of your thing?(I‚Äôm assuming not?)
[09/05/19, 9:05:42 PM] Sush: i mean, no
[09/05/19, 9:05:49 PM] Sush: but our lab has like three people lol
[09/05/19, 9:05:56 PM] Sush: it's just awkward
[16/05/19, 12:48:54 PM] Sush: how pissed are you at game of thrones
[16/05/19, 12:49:06 PM] Sush: (right answer is *very* )
[16/05/19, 12:53:33 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I‚Äôm getting over it because I‚Äôm now pissed at other things
[16/05/19, 12:53:44 PM] Sush: ugh fair
[16/05/19, 12:53:46 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I‚Äôve been a bit pissed all day and it‚Äôs quite exhausting, actually
[16/05/19, 12:53:51 PM] Sush: other life things?
[16/05/19, 12:53:55 PM] Sush: or other media?
[16/05/19, 12:54:01 PM] Nikhil Dubai: But yeah I was SO pissed even though I knew it was going to happen
[16/05/19, 12:54:04 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Life things :)
[16/05/19, 12:54:17 PM] Sush: ayy i'm sorry!
[16/05/19, 12:54:28 PM] Nikhil Dubai: No, like bullshit life things
[16/05/19, 12:54:28 PM] Sush: ü§¨x1000
[16/05/19, 12:55:32 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Like not getting the project I wanted, having to do some minor extra work on something I thought was done, and most of all tremendously pissed at the dumbfuck delivery driver who called me once, didn‚Äôt respond to the 3 times I called him after, called me once again right when I was in a meeting, and then decided he had waited too long and left
[16/05/19, 12:55:53 PM] Sush: ugh that all sucks!
[16/05/19, 12:56:00 PM] Nikhil Dubai: It does
[16/05/19, 12:56:30 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Also pissed that I‚Äôm in Riyadh on a Thursday in the first place even though I was initially ok with it since Mia is in India anyway
[16/05/19, 12:56:34 PM] Sush: do you (and mia) have time to go do something fun and distracting with mia?
[16/05/19, 12:56:42 PM] Sush: ohh nvm
[16/05/19, 12:57:30 PM] Nikhil Dubai: So I was having dinner by myself and this partner at the office drops in and says hi and says you look very clearly sad and as I explain some of these things I can see how silly a lot of it sounds
[16/05/19, 12:57:43 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Which eh
[16/05/19, 12:57:52 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Mia is actually coming back tomorrow morning
[16/05/19, 12:58:13 PM] Nikhil Dubai: But I was a bit pissed at her also, although we had a ‚Äúconstructive‚Äù conversation about it last night
[16/05/19, 12:58:52 PM] Sush: i hate that. i had a fair bit of that this past week, i think.
[16/05/19, 12:58:54 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I find her way of giving career advice and some of her general quirks and annoyances much more annoying if I‚Äôm already in a bad mood.
[16/05/19, 12:59:47 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Yeah? Like, the unsolicited hey hows it goings? I honestly don‚Äôt mind that too much usually
[16/05/19, 1:00:00 PM] Sush: that's fair! career advice is hard to hear at the best of times
[16/05/19, 1:00:53 PM] Sush: esp when the person its coming has a v different way of operating wrt their career (and is a loved one impacted by your decisions and vice-versa)
[16/05/19, 1:01:07 PM] Sush: no, being bogged down by things which sound pretty silly
[16/05/19, 1:01:21 PM] Sush: *person its coming from
[16/05/19, 1:06:34 PM] Nikhil Dubai: So I get annoyed/stressed out enough by work, but also have a habit of not being proactive enough or doing something about it
[16/05/19, 1:07:01 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Mia has a tendency to make these things feel a LOT more like a personal failing
[16/05/19, 1:07:43 PM] Nikhil Dubai: (And I mean, I get that it is, strictly speaking, but you know what I mean...do you?)
[16/05/19, 1:08:21 PM] Sush: i know what you mean! i am a lot like you're describing yourself too and i've definitely seen people who *don't* have that tendency be utterly befuddled by it
[16/05/19, 1:09:00 PM] Sush: to them it's like all the pieces to the puzzle are there why wouldn't you just put them together
[16/05/19, 1:09:40 PM] Sush: it's hard to articulate why that feels impossible sometimes lol
[16/05/19, 1:10:30 PM] Nikhil Dubai: And ‚Äúimpacted by‚Äù etc is all fine but I have (what is think is) the healthy perspective that, if I take an extra 6 months or a year to get promoted or if I quit and do something else it‚Äôs not like we‚Äôre going to, forget starve, have any meaningful change to our standard of living
[16/05/19, 1:11:01 PM] Sush: that's very true
[16/05/19, 1:11:28 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Whereas for her any time you‚Äôre not maximizing your potential is a loss
[16/05/19, 1:14:17 PM] Sush: i wonder how we can shift frameworks while talking to another person about their issues
[16/05/19, 1:14:39 PM] Sush: like GIVEN YOUR FRAMEWORK maybe you could do this?
[16/05/19, 1:14:48 PM] Sush: and you doing the same for her
[16/05/19, 1:15:09 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Elaborate?
[16/05/19, 1:15:26 PM] Nikhil Dubai: We had a discussion on roughly those lines yesterday
[16/05/19, 1:15:43 PM] Sush: like when she gives you career advice, she sets aside her own framework
[16/05/19, 1:15:57 PM] Sush: she gives you advices optimizing for the things _you're_ optimizing for
[16/05/19, 1:16:07 PM] Sush: as opposed to what _she's_ optimizing for
[16/05/19, 1:16:25 PM] Sush: like, just accept that you're optimizing for different things and take it from there
[16/05/19, 1:19:45 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Hmm
[16/05/19, 1:20:35 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I think it is also a different optimization approach as well as goal, and I also think these are almost values differences in some weird sense, but yeah, I get it
[16/05/19, 1:21:09 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I get where she‚Äôs coming from, because she has this whole thing where she‚Äôs seen friends who are more, like, idle rich, and she wants never to be seen like that, etc
[16/05/19, 1:21:44 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Btw, I don‚Äôt do it very often, but I like that you don‚Äôt much encourage me bitching about Mia :)
[16/05/19, 1:23:48 PM] Sush: You definitely don't do it often! I think I've felt alienated from my friends in the past when they sort of join me in bitching about someone i love haha.
[16/05/19, 1:23:59 PM] Sush: I guess it's not super constructive and also she sounds mostly great :)
[16/05/19, 1:24:03 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Talk later, flights taking off
[16/05/19, 1:24:53 PM] Sush: alrighty, fly safe!
[22/05/19, 3:59:21 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Yo
[22/05/19, 4:00:02 PM] Nikhil Dubai: https://www.chronicle.com/interactives/20190510-academes-extinction-event?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app
[26/05/19, 11:24:45 PM] Sush: I just read this
[26/05/19, 11:24:47 PM] Sush: Sooo good
[26/05/19, 11:26:46 PM] Sush: I want to send it to Siddharth but I think he‚Äôll get mad lmao
[27/05/19, 10:58:17 AM] Sush: Ok listen lol
[27/05/19, 3:35:40 PM] Nikhil Dubai: ?
[27/05/19, 3:36:23 PM] Sush: Lol
[27/05/19, 3:36:29 PM] Sush: I‚Äôm at Siddharth‚Äôs wedding
[27/05/19, 3:36:38 PM] Sush: I was having some emotions in the morning
[27/05/19, 3:36:46 PM] Sush: Now I‚Äôm happy only
[27/05/19, 3:37:49 PM] Sush: Was feeling a little weird about being here when I texted you
[27/05/19, 3:38:02 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Ah :)
[27/05/19, 3:38:12 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Where is this exactly?
[27/05/19, 3:38:26 PM] Sush: Columbus Ohio
[27/05/19, 3:38:34 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Interesting:)
[27/05/19, 3:39:31 PM] Sush: Yeahh I was a little bit like maybe I shouldn‚Äôt have come
[27/05/19, 3:39:50 PM] Sush: But then I talked to him and the wedding was beautiful and I‚Äôm happy I came
[27/05/19, 4:02:28 PM] Sush: This is a lot lol
[27/05/19, 4:31:51 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Are you like calm and happy or weirded out happy?
[27/05/19, 4:52:09 PM] Sush: I‚Äôm calm only
[27/05/19, 4:54:08 PM] Sush: It‚Äôs a little weird to have so many people talk about the inevitability of it
[27/05/19, 4:54:33 PM] Sush: Also omg his mom said I thought he was going to tell me he met the love of his life in iitm but he didn‚Äôt lmao
[27/05/19, 4:54:42 PM] Sush: And like four people looked at me
[28/05/19, 12:51:31 PM] Sush: Hihi
[28/05/19, 12:52:26 PM] Sush: There was a tornado and I‚Äôm on a very circuitous flight back home
[28/05/19, 1:34:24 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Oh damn
[28/05/19, 1:35:26 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Ohio is pretty close no?
[28/05/19, 1:35:38 PM] Sush: It is
[28/05/19, 1:35:47 PM] Sush: I‚Äôm in philly now lol
[28/05/19, 1:35:55 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Whoa :)
[28/05/19, 1:35:58 PM] Sush: Columbus - philly - Chicago
[28/05/19, 1:36:15 PM] Sush: What a stupid tornado I‚Äôm v mad
[28/05/19, 1:36:25 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I can imagine.
[28/05/19, 1:36:44 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Did you take a couple of days off for the wedding or is this some holiday season I don‚Äôt know about?
[28/05/19, 1:36:55 PM] Sush: Yesterday was Memorial Day
[28/05/19, 1:37:15 PM] Sush: So I went to Ohio yday morning and was supposed to leave last night
[28/05/19, 1:37:27 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Ah I see
[28/05/19, 1:38:20 PM] Nikhil Dubai: It‚Äôs Tuesday night here and we typically fly out from the client site on Wednesday, with thursdays being work from office/home - so for me it‚Äôs almost like the end of the week :)
[28/05/19, 1:43:39 PM] Sush: So nice!
[28/05/19, 1:43:51 PM] Sush: Are you guys doing something fun
[28/05/19, 1:44:14 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Er, I‚Äôm still in Saudi and browsing twitter instead of working
[28/05/19, 1:45:04 PM] Sush: Lolol
[28/05/19, 1:45:06 PM] Sush: I mean, fair
[28/05/19, 1:45:10 PM] Sush: The twitter part
[28/05/19, 1:45:51 PM] Nikhil Dubai: And obsessively reading the 3 body problem (which I finished yesterday actually - on to the sequel now)
[28/05/19, 1:45:59 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I should probably be working much harder
[28/05/19, 1:46:02 PM] Sush: Ohhh how was it
[28/05/19, 1:46:36 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I mean, the writing isn‚Äôt great and I‚Äôm sure if I thought more about it the plot holes would be glaring, but it was pretty exciting to read
[28/05/19, 1:47:04 PM] Sush: I want to obsessively read something
[28/05/19, 1:52:52 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I‚Äôm going to try and sleep early today and wake up and get some work done
[28/05/19, 1:53:18 PM] Sush: Good luck!
[04/06/19, 12:08:06 PM] Sush: hii
[05/06/19, 2:06:20 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Hey :)
[15/06/19, 3:27:55 AM] Nikhil Dubai: You‚Äôve done one of these meditation retreats, no?
[15/06/19, 7:02:08 AM] Sush: No but I really want to
[15/06/19, 7:14:49 AM] Sush: You‚Äôre thinking of trying ?
[15/06/19, 7:15:27 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Just thought about it
[15/06/19, 8:30:24 AM] Sush: A friend of mine went to vipassana and got sober!
[15/06/19, 8:31:42 AM] Sush: idk if he was an ‚Äòaddict‚Äô but his alcohol and drug consumption were seriously getting in the way of being a regular functioning adult
[15/06/19, 8:55:50 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Yeah?
[15/06/19, 8:56:08 AM] Nikhil Dubai: I think quite a lot of us are functioning semi alcoholics actually
[15/06/19, 8:57:05 AM] Sush: This girl I vaguely wrote about her experience too 
https://putulgupta.wordpress.com/2012/11/10/vipasana-a-journey-within/
[15/06/19, 8:56:44 AM] Nikhil Dubai: I already crave it every weekend, and not in a social way, just in a drink/read/ watch Tv way.
[15/06/19, 8:57:43 AM] Sush: Yeah? Have you ever tried going off for a few weeks?
[15/06/19, 8:57:56 AM] Sush: *i vaguely know
[19/06/19, 2:05:19 PM] Sush: hi friend
[19/06/19, 2:05:43 PM] Sush: are you doing vipassana
[19/06/19, 2:05:56 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Hey
[19/06/19, 2:06:15 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I should, I‚Äôm pretty stressed out and don‚Äôt k ow when it‚Äôll get better
[19/06/19, 2:06:29 PM] Nikhil Dubai: But I also don‚Äôt know when I‚Äôll have the time :)
[19/06/19, 2:06:35 PM] Nikhil Dubai: How‚Äôs it going?
[19/06/19, 2:06:37 PM] Sush: I hear you -_- I'm not _stressed out_ but I'm very adrift.
[19/06/19, 2:06:54 PM] Sush: and i can't even put underscores in the right spots
[19/06/19, 2:07:16 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Why are you adrift?
[19/06/19, 2:07:37 PM] Sush: untethered in work, life and love :P
[19/06/19, 2:07:44 PM] Sush: hahaha that sounds way more dramatic than it is
[19/06/19, 2:08:10 PM] Sush: it's not that bad i'm just back to being in a pre-transition phase
[19/06/19, 2:08:42 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I actually am feeling a bit too tethered and kind of chomping at the bit to just go off and not do anything and bum around for a few months by myself. Even as I know that that would likely be depressing
[19/06/19, 2:08:47 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Pre transition? To?
[19/06/19, 2:08:59 PM] Sush: ugh if only we could average out
[19/06/19, 2:09:22 PM] Sush: i guess this is the source of some stress
[19/06/19, 2:09:38 PM] Sush: also feeling the pressure of turning 28 soon
[19/06/19, 2:09:58 PM] Sush: do you have any time off in the near future?
[19/06/19, 2:10:17 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I don‚Äôt know if 28 is so much of a milestone that you need to stress out over it :)
[19/06/19, 2:10:28 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I‚Äôll have a week off in August
[19/06/19, 2:10:39 PM] Sush: it feels like a warning sign :P
[19/06/19, 2:10:44 PM] Sush: like a signal to course correct
[19/06/19, 2:11:26 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I actually just had a week off start of June! but we were furniture shopping, which was far more stressful and time consuming than expected, and I was living with my in-laws, and overall was much less relaxed than I preferred
[19/06/19, 2:11:52 PM] Sush: furniture shopping for new house?
[19/06/19, 2:11:54 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Course correct from what (and I think an accurate assessment here is important) and to (very broadly) what?
[19/06/19, 2:11:56 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Yeah
[19/06/19, 2:12:24 PM] Nikhil Dubai: So my parents are flying in tomorrow and we are doing a house warming thing they forced me to do on Friday
[19/06/19, 2:12:29 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Which I‚Äôm still annoyed about
[19/06/19, 2:13:07 PM] Sush: from being in this post-student limbo to actually embarking on some sort of path in data science - but question is what path, where and when to transition
[19/06/19, 2:13:25 PM] Sush: ohhh my parents did this to my sister and she was v annoyed too
[19/06/19, 2:13:35 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Yeah?
[19/06/19, 2:13:46 PM] Sush: yeah, it was a nuisance for everyone
[19/06/19, 2:13:51 PM] Nikhil Dubai: So it‚Äôs actually very annoying for a couple of different reasons
[19/06/19, 2:14:00 PM] Sush: but they were convinced not doing it would end up in complete disaster
[19/06/19, 2:14:07 PM] Nikhil Dubai: One, it‚Äôs a major nuisance and the house is nowhere near ready to have guests
[19/06/19, 2:14:17 PM] Nikhil Dubai: And Mia is stressing out over it like mad
[19/06/19, 2:15:23 PM] Sush: is it just close family?
[19/06/19, 2:15:31 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Yeah
[19/06/19, 2:16:13 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Two, what is especially annoying is that I think they‚Äôre also pushing for it to happen and for them to be there because they feel (and I‚Äôm not sure I fully understand it) that because her parents will be there when we move in, it is ‚Äúinappropriate‚Äù if they aren‚Äôt also there.
[19/06/19, 2:16:51 PM] Sush: ohh that's very annoying
[19/06/19, 2:17:21 PM] Sush: and these vague undefined 'responsibilities' are near impossible to talk people out of
[19/06/19, 2:17:30 PM] Sush: 'it won't look good'
[19/06/19, 2:17:33 PM] Sush: wtf does that MEAN
[19/06/19, 2:17:35 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Yeah!
[19/06/19, 2:17:59 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I‚Äôm just so happy I‚Äôm not living in India where all this would be SOOOO much worse
[19/06/19, 2:18:09 PM] Sush: like, *this* doesnt look good to YOUR OWN OFFSPRING
[19/06/19, 2:18:22 PM] Sush: why doesn't that trump other considerations lol
[19/06/19, 2:18:42 PM] Sush: ugh yeah it drives my sister nuts
[19/06/19, 2:19:37 PM] Sush: and the expectations of hosting etc are all on her - ashwin is great and pulls his weight in their household but if he even makes a cup of coffee, guests are like SO SWEET HUSBAND
[19/06/19, 2:19:49 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Haha
[19/06/19, 2:19:50 PM] Sush: whereas with my sister anything she does is seen as the least she could do
[19/06/19, 2:20:46 PM] Nikhil Dubai: So Mia both genuinely hates doing anything in the kitchen, and also REALLY hates that she‚Äôs _expected_ to serve people and do all of this
[19/06/19, 2:21:10 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Which is one big reason why we don‚Äôt really invite people over
[19/06/19, 2:21:23 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Which of course everyone also bitches about both directly and subtly
[19/06/19, 2:21:40 PM] Sush: that's so unfair and irritating :/
[19/06/19, 2:22:06 PM] Sush: the expectation makes you hate it even more also
[19/06/19, 2:22:37 PM] Sush: i do love cooking / hosting but i think it's really only possible for me to . because i've never been asked to do it and i only do it when i choose to
[19/06/19, 2:23:00 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Yeah exactly
[19/06/19, 2:23:11 PM] Sush: it's also so weird that you're expected to know all this overnight after you get married
[19/06/19, 2:23:42 PM] Sush: i get allowances for things in a way that my sister doesnt - which makes no sense because my sister's never lived away from home and i haven't lived at home for ten years
[19/06/19, 2:23:45 PM] Nikhil Dubai: In this case, she‚Äôs also never done it before at all and she has extreme perfectionist tendencies so if there‚Äôs a chance it will invite criticism she just won‚Äôt do it
[19/06/19, 2:24:12 PM] Sush: ohhh yeah that sounds stressful
[19/06/19, 2:25:46 PM] Sush: how do you go about re-setting expectations?
[19/06/19, 2:25:58 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Hmm?
[19/06/19, 2:26:01 PM] Sush: it requires so much initial friction
[19/06/19, 2:26:08 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Oh yes
[19/06/19, 2:26:20 PM] Sush: like communicating to the family that you're just not interested/ inclined
[19/06/19, 2:26:23 PM] Nikhil Dubai: And the thing is it still doesn‚Äôt actually get reset
[19/06/19, 2:26:31 PM] Nikhil Dubai: They just get snippy about it
[19/06/19, 2:27:23 PM] Sush: that's also so fucking annoying
[19/06/19, 2:27:39 PM] Sush: passive aggression is the woooorst
[19/06/19, 2:27:48 PM] Sush: my mom literally did this on FACETIME two days ago
[19/06/19, 2:27:54 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Yeah?
[19/06/19, 2:28:07 PM] Sush: she *always* thinks i look homeless
[19/06/19, 2:28:20 PM] Sush: i'll be heading out and she'll say 'ok go get changed'
[19/06/19, 2:28:27 PM] Sush: I'M CHANGED, MOTHER.
[19/06/19, 2:28:33 PM] Sush: THIS IS WHAT I'M WEARING.
[19/06/19, 2:28:42 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Haha
[19/06/19, 2:29:09 PM] Sush: she facetimed me a couple of days ago and was like oh you're going to work? haven't gotten dressed yet?
[19/06/19, 2:29:27 PM] Sush: it's 100% not a genuine mistake she knows exactly what she's saying lol
[19/06/19, 2:30:00 PM] Nikhil Dubai: üòÅ
[19/06/19, 2:30:16 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Sorry I guess it‚Äôs annoying but it does sound quite funny
[19/06/19, 2:30:38 PM] Sush: i'm amused when i'm in a good mood but otherwise it makes me want to throw something lol
[19/06/19, 2:32:46 PM] Sush: i've also been 'dating' of late
[19/06/19, 2:32:52 PM] Sush: and usually i'm just indifferent
[19/06/19, 2:33:00 PM] Sush: but i went on a date last week that i didn't hate
[19/06/19, 2:33:05 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Hmm?
[19/06/19, 2:33:08 PM] Sush: and i was like ok whatevs that was fun about it
[19/06/19, 2:33:18 PM] Sush: but HE didn't reply to my text and now i'm obsessing lol
[19/06/19, 2:33:23 PM] Nikhil Dubai: When were you officially not ‚Äòdating‚Äô :-/
[19/06/19, 2:33:37 PM] Sush: like more actively
[19/06/19, 2:33:48 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Ah ok
[19/06/19, 2:34:06 PM] Sush: like, 'online dating'
[19/06/19, 2:34:15 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Lol I see
[19/06/19, 2:34:17 PM] Sush: OMG do you want ugly gossip
[19/06/19, 2:34:22 PM] Sush: i was so grossed out
[19/06/19, 2:34:23 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Sure
[19/06/19, 2:34:27 PM] Sush: remember that married dude?
[19/06/19, 2:34:32 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Yeah?
[19/06/19, 2:34:49 PM] Sush: i saw his profile under a FAKE NAME on a dating app
[19/06/19, 2:34:55 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Ohh
[19/06/19, 2:35:12 PM] Sush: i can't believe how deliberately awful that is
[19/06/19, 2:36:37 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Yeah that‚Äôs pretty clearly not something ‚Äújust happening ‚Äù or being too weak or whatever, it‚Äôs a deliberate choice
[19/06/19, 2:36:39 PM] Sush: i was def right not to buy the 'conflicted' rhetoric phew
[19/06/19, 2:36:49 PM] Sush: yeah!!!
[19/06/19, 2:37:05 PM] Sush: and it's so so so insensitive
[19/06/19, 2:37:11 PM] Sush: like what if her friends see it
[19/06/19, 2:37:30 PM] Sush: if you're going to hurt someone you love, at least preserve their dignity while doing it?
[19/06/19, 2:37:44 PM] Sush: idk, it's so public and insulting to his wife
[19/06/19, 2:38:59 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Indeed
[19/06/19, 2:39:41 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I was thinking, at best it ensures ppl from the app can‚Äôt stalk him in real life, but with photos the fake name does nothing whatsoever to preserve your anonymity with people you actually know
[19/06/19, 2:39:52 PM] Sush: yeah!
[19/06/19, 2:40:09 PM] Sush: and he'll probably claim someone's using his pictures to catfish women if his wife finds out
[19/06/19, 2:40:23 PM] Sush: it's so horrible!
[19/06/19, 2:40:50 PM] Sush: and he's going to be a cop!
[19/06/19, 2:40:56 PM] Sush: no integrity whatsoever .
[19/06/19, 2:41:46 PM] Nikhil Dubai: He‚Äôs going to be a cop? I thought he was working in the same field as you?
[19/06/19, 2:42:20 PM] Sush: he works for a violence prevention organization
[19/06/19, 2:42:41 PM] Sush: which is part of a program that my lab is evaluating
[19/06/19, 2:42:52 PM] Sush: he was also at uchicago when i was there
[19/06/19, 2:43:35 PM] Sush: he's ex-military etc
[19/06/19, 2:43:41 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Oh I see
[19/06/19, 2:43:48 PM] Sush: i think this is also sketchy
[19/06/19, 2:43:54 PM] Sush: his org doesn't know he's going to be a cop
[19/06/19, 2:44:16 PM] Sush: and it's not nice to like, be present in gang mediations etc if you're going to join the damn police
[19/06/19, 2:44:59 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Hmm.
[19/06/19, 2:45:22 PM] Sush: idk how much of the info is usable
[19/06/19, 2:45:32 PM] Sush: but i do think the participants are entitled to know this
[19/06/19, 2:46:23 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Or the org
[19/06/19, 2:46:42 PM] Sush: yeahh
[19/06/19, 2:46:49 PM] Sush: i hate to be a judgey aunty
[19/06/19, 2:46:52 PM] Sush: but MORAL DECAY
[19/06/19, 2:46:54 PM] Sush: lol
[19/06/19, 2:48:15 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Haha
[19/06/19, 2:48:43 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I think this is pretty established immorality, not fresh decay
[19/06/19, 2:49:15 PM] Sush: true :P
[19/06/19, 2:49:24 PM] Sush: moral decay of an individual
[19/06/19, 2:49:54 PM] Sush: i guess it is literally the oldest most universal form of immorality
[19/06/19, 2:50:23 PM] Sush: ohh watch Fleabag?
[19/06/19, 2:53:42 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Nope
[19/06/19, 2:53:58 PM] Sush: I think you‚Äôll like!
[19/06/19, 2:54:03 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Yeah?
[19/06/19, 2:54:07 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I heard about it
[19/06/19, 2:54:39 PM] Sush: It makes you feel a little hopeless sometimes but also makes you laugh and have #warm feelings
[19/06/19, 2:54:39 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I‚Äôm sufficiently passive now that I mostly only watch things if they come up within 5 minutes of scrolling through Netflix
[19/06/19, 2:55:09 PM] Sush: Phoebe Waller price is incredibly talented
[19/06/19, 2:55:17 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I remember her from Crashing
[19/06/19, 2:55:26 PM] Sush: And Olivia Coleman is in it and is phenomenal
[19/06/19, 2:55:38 PM] Sush: It‚Äôs actually not dissimilar is general tone
[19/06/19, 2:55:46 PM] Sush: But I liked it a lot more
[19/06/19, 2:56:04 PM] Sush: It‚Äôs on amazon prime
[19/06/19, 2:56:47 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Yeah I still need to get that
[19/06/19, 2:57:10 PM] Nikhil Dubai: My amazon account is still us based and I obviously don‚Äôt want to pay for prime in the US
[19/06/19, 2:57:22 PM] Nikhil Dubai: But if I change countries all my kindle stuff gets changed
[19/06/19, 2:58:08 PM] Sush: ugh yeah
[19/06/19, 2:58:19 PM] Sush: you can use mine
[19/06/19, 2:58:31 PM] Sush: let me check if im home if i share the password with other apps haha
[19/06/19, 2:58:38 PM] Sush: *when
[19/06/19, 2:58:43 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Haha
[19/06/19, 2:59:21 PM] Nikhil Dubai: That‚Äôs sweet but I might just get Mia to change hers - also US, but since she doesn‚Äôt use it i think that should be fine.
[19/06/19, 3:01:31 PM] Sush: ok :) watch it tho!!
[19/06/19, 3:03:46 PM] Nikhil Dubai: The shows you have access to depends on the country you‚Äôre watching from and not the country your account is based in, no?
[19/06/19, 3:04:25 PM] Sush: yes
[19/06/19, 3:04:36 PM] Sush: my netflix options look v different in hyd
[19/06/19, 3:05:33 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Which is a bit weird if you only care about video (for prime), since it‚Äôs like 999/year in India and I think 100+ dollars in the us
[19/06/19, 3:06:20 PM] Nikhil Dubai: And prime video is 6$/month in Dubai
[19/06/19, 3:06:49 PM] Sush: i can't actually use my .com prime privileges on the .in site though
[19/06/19, 3:08:47 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Yes I would assume so
[19/06/19, 3:08:57 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Ok I have been half heartedly staring at my laptop
[19/06/19, 3:09:08 PM] Nikhil Dubai: It‚Äôs 11 and I have at least an hour of work
[19/06/19, 3:09:19 PM] Nikhil Dubai: So I‚Äôm going to go finish it off and sleep
[19/06/19, 3:09:22 PM] Sush: ok good luck :P i will go do some writing
[19/06/19, 3:09:25 PM] Sush: ttyl!
[19/06/19, 3:09:46 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Man, i‚Äôve been saying ‚Äúwrite something‚Äù for ages now and never got around to it :(
[19/06/19, 3:09:53 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Conversation for later
[19/06/19, 3:09:55 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Bye!
[19/06/19, 3:10:10 PM] Sush: :) bye!
‚Äé[30/06/19, 8:41:55 AM] Sush: ‚Äéimage omitted
[30/06/19, 8:42:05 AM] Sush: I think we do this üòÇ
[30/06/19, 8:42:36 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Lol
[20/07/19, 7:57:25 AM] Sush: Hello!
[20/07/19, 7:57:55 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Hello!
‚Äé[20/07/19, 7:57:59 AM] Sush: ‚ÄéGIF omitted
[20/07/19, 7:58:24 AM] Nikhil Dubai: I‚Äôm day drinking and just enjoying my uninterrupted sea view
[20/07/19, 7:58:36 AM] Sush: Oooh where are you?
[20/07/19, 7:58:46 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Er, just my new apartment
[20/07/19, 7:59:02 AM] Sush: Hahaha wonderful!!
[20/07/19, 7:59:16 AM] Sush: Show me your view!
[20/07/19, 7:59:29 AM] Nikhil Dubai: It‚Äôs ungodly hot but will go down to the pool in a bit I think
[20/07/19, 7:59:31 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Hmm
[20/07/19, 7:59:48 AM] Sush: It‚Äôs so hot here too!
[20/07/19, 7:59:57 AM] Sush: We‚Äôre having a heat wave
‚Äé[20/07/19, 8:00:32 AM] Nikhil Dubai: ‚Äéimage omitted
[20/07/19, 8:00:45 AM] Sush: I mean it‚Äôs still only a max of 35C
[20/07/19, 8:00:49 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Really? It‚Äôs 40 degrees here- what is it there?
[20/07/19, 8:00:51 AM] Sush: Oooh lovely!
[20/07/19, 8:00:58 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Ah ok
[20/07/19, 8:01:27 AM] Nikhil Dubai: So it‚Äôs ‚Äú39 but feels like 52‚Äù because of 52% humidity right now
[20/07/19, 8:01:35 AM] Sush: Oh gosh
[20/07/19, 8:02:06 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Yep
[20/07/19, 8:02:12 AM] Sush: It‚Äôs 27 feels like 29 with 73% humidity already and it‚Äôs only 8 am
[20/07/19, 8:02:28 AM] Sush: Also all these apartments are built to trap heat
[20/07/19, 8:02:46 AM] Sush: Because ‚Äòtoo much heat‚Äô happens like 5 days in a year lol
[20/07/19, 8:02:53 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Lol
[20/07/19, 8:03:06 AM] Nikhil Dubai: But 29 is still pretty ok no?
[20/07/19, 8:03:14 AM] Nikhil Dubai: I guess mid day might be worse
[20/07/19, 8:03:18 AM] Sush: Yeah
[20/07/19, 8:03:27 AM] Sush: Idk if it‚Äôs the angle or what
[20/07/19, 8:03:42 AM] Sush: But I think 37 in Chicago feels more enervating than 37 in Hyderabad
[20/07/19, 8:04:10 AM] Sush: Or I just spend more time outdoors / walking here
[20/07/19, 8:04:38 AM] Nikhil Dubai: I had to look up enervating because I thought it actually meant the opposite of what it actually means
[20/07/19, 8:04:58 AM] Sush: üòÇ I guess it sounds like energising!
[20/07/19, 8:05:14 AM] Nikhil Dubai: :) yeah
[20/07/19, 8:05:33 AM] Sush: I am actually feeling kinda bummed out
[20/07/19, 8:05:42 AM] Sush: It‚Äôs very likely I‚Äôll need a spinal surgery
[20/07/19, 8:05:55 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Oh no! How come?
[20/07/19, 8:06:02 AM] Sush: A discectomy, apparently
[20/07/19, 8:06:29 AM] Sush: I have a large herniation in c5-c6 which has been causing all my neck pain stuff
[20/07/19, 8:12:34 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Ouch
[20/07/19, 8:12:43 AM] Nikhil Dubai: I‚Äôm sorry
[20/07/19, 8:13:29 AM] Nikhil Dubai: So I also had this sudden and annoying back pain and went to see the doctor and took some x rays and an ultrasound in case it‚Äôs kidney stones but most likely it‚Äôs just a posture/muscle sprain thing
[20/07/19, 8:13:52 AM] Sush: Ohh I‚Äôm glad it isn‚Äôt anything more
[20/07/19, 8:14:23 AM] Sush: Is it better?
[20/07/19, 8:15:04 AM] Sush: In a way it‚Äôs good to have a diagnosis now after pain on and off for like four years
[20/07/19, 8:15:24 AM] Nikhil Dubai: It‚Äôs better, yeah
[20/07/19, 8:15:40 AM] Nikhil Dubai: But i‚Äôve also had it on and off for a bit
[20/07/19, 8:15:46 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Mostly upper back minor aches
[20/07/19, 8:16:14 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Then a sharp thing in my lower back after playing with my cousins, then a pain in the same place randomly a week later, which is why I saw the doctor
[20/07/19, 8:16:25 AM] Sush: Oh ouch!
[20/07/19, 8:16:41 AM] Sush: Why are our backs so dumb and weak ü§¨
[20/07/19, 8:17:03 AM] Sush: Like a little disc in my back just decided to expel its innards?
[20/07/19, 8:17:19 AM] Sush: How gross and how pointless!
[20/07/19, 8:17:40 AM] Sush: #baddesign
[20/07/19, 8:26:22 AM] Nikhil Dubai: :) indeed
[20/07/19, 8:27:14 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Its quite interesting to think of all these health issues in terms of the evolutionary design trade offs that probably led to it happening
[20/07/19, 8:27:41 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Is it just that we are now out of the testing environment parameters, or is it just not meant to work this way?
[20/07/19, 8:28:29 AM] Sush: Maybe we are the point at which adjustments will start to happen
[20/07/19, 8:28:47 AM] Sush: I‚Äôm the unfit that‚Äôs getting seeded out atm
[20/07/19, 8:28:52 AM] Sush: *weeded
[20/07/19, 8:28:54 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Except that evolution is way slower than, you know, pills and prosthetics
[20/07/19, 8:29:33 AM] Sush: Yeah, I guess it‚Äôs good we have pills plans prosthetics meanwhile
[20/07/19, 8:30:14 AM] Sush: 200 years from now our spines will know how to use computers for ten hours a day
[20/07/19, 8:30:17 AM] Sush: 2000?
[20/07/19, 8:30:26 AM] Sush: Lol
[20/07/19, 8:30:41 AM] Nikhil Dubai: 200 is 6 generations which is clearly not going to be much /)
[20/07/19, 8:31:20 AM] Nikhil Dubai: 60, maybe, if the pressure is acute enough. Just need to make sure people with back issues don‚Äôt get to hook up as much :)
[20/07/19, 8:31:44 AM] Sush: üòÖüòÖ
[20/07/19, 8:32:04 AM] Sush: Im so over my back
[20/07/19, 8:32:21 AM] Sush: Spent all day yday feeling VERY SORRY for myself
[20/07/19, 8:32:58 AM] Sush: also about how as a society we still don‚Äôt know how to provide care to adults outside marriage
[20/07/19, 8:33:09 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Hmm?
[20/07/19, 8:33:36 AM] Sush: Like I‚Äôm only 27 but i was reading through how to handle post-op care
[20/07/19, 8:33:49 AM] Sush: and it‚Äôs not awful but it would be hard to do by yourself
[20/07/19, 8:34:28 AM] Sush: Like I shouldn‚Äôt bend too much for six weeks
[20/07/19, 8:34:39 AM] Sush: Can‚Äôt lift more than a gallon of milk
[20/07/19, 8:35:06 AM] Sush: Shouldn‚Äôt reach up over my head / run / jump
[20/07/19, 8:36:42 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Ouch
[20/07/19, 8:37:27 AM] Sush: My parents want to come, which I might let them do üòÖ
[20/07/19, 8:37:39 AM] Sush: but you know, otherwise
[20/07/19, 8:37:42 AM] Nikhil Dubai: I guess the idea is not marriage necessarily, but just that bad health makes it much more important to have someone who cares for you around to help
[20/07/19, 8:38:01 AM] Sush: Yep - and we haven‚Äôt figured out ways to do that outside marriage
[20/07/19, 8:43:23 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Hmm
[20/07/19, 8:43:54 AM] Nikhil Dubai: I mean, the capitalist solution, of course, is to pay someone to care
[20/07/19, 8:44:17 AM] Nikhil Dubai: And a more ancient solution is just community care, which has its issues
[20/07/19, 8:44:43 AM] Sush: I guess I wish my friends lived closer
[20/07/19, 8:44:53 AM] Sush: I would have been waaaay less worried in Hyde park
[20/07/19, 8:45:00 AM] Sush: (Before I moved)
[20/07/19, 8:45:10 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Yeah but to your point you still basically need someone who lives with you
[20/07/19, 8:45:47 AM] Sush: True it‚Äôs so much easier with a community though
[20/07/19, 8:46:06 AM] Sush: Last year a friend went through chemo
[20/07/19, 8:46:24 AM] Sush: And a ‚Äòcare circle‚Äô formed almost organically
[20/07/19, 8:46:34 AM] Sush: Because we were all already in this tiny community
[20/07/19, 8:47:26 AM] Sush: Physical proximity makes help less of a big ask
[20/07/19, 8:54:52 AM] Nikhil Dubai: True
[20/07/19, 8:55:12 AM] Nikhil Dubai: God, I can‚Äôt even imagine how I‚Äôd react if I just found out I had to get chemo
[20/07/19, 8:55:22 AM] Sush: Yeah, no??
[20/07/19, 8:55:38 AM] Sush: She‚Äôs in remission now
[20/07/19, 8:55:43 AM] Sush: So, phew!
[20/07/19, 8:56:01 AM] Sush: I called my dad and cried for this only
[20/07/19, 8:56:29 AM] Sush: Stepped out of the hospital, walked across to the lake and bawled lol
[20/07/19, 8:56:41 AM] Sush: I was dressed up too - went to a conference right after
[20/07/19, 8:56:50 AM] Sush: I must have made a ridiculous sight
[20/07/19, 8:56:59 AM] Nikhil Dubai: üò¢
[20/07/19, 8:57:30 AM] Sush: I‚Äôm so annoyed!!!
[20/07/19, 8:57:41 AM] Sush: Apparently I have to get an epidural steroid first
[20/07/19, 8:58:02 AM] Sush: Because insurance won‚Äôt cover surgery unless they see a non surgical method attempted
[20/07/19, 8:58:25 AM] Sush: And the doctor basically that will most likely not help me üôÑ
[20/07/19, 8:58:27 AM] Nikhil Dubai: ü§ó
[20/07/19, 8:58:36 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Ok that‚Äôs not what I wanted to send
[20/07/19, 8:58:44 AM] Nikhil Dubai: There is apparently no appropriate hugging emoji
[20/07/19, 8:58:51 AM] Sush: HahahaüòÇ
[20/07/19, 8:59:03 AM] Nikhil Dubai: And ok, that‚Äôs just randomly annoying
[20/07/19, 8:59:07 AM] Sush: It is a failure of imagination tbh
[20/07/19, 8:59:17 AM] Sush: The absence of a proper hug emoji
[20/07/19, 8:59:25 AM] Nikhil Dubai: :)
[20/07/19, 8:59:38 AM] Sush: Right?!
[20/07/19, 9:00:50 AM] Nikhil Dubai: So the one thing I was relatively happy with was the insurance process here
[20/07/19, 9:01:42 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Like, I did have to wait a day for them to approve the ultrasound, and also had to wait while they corrected some paperwork issue in the hospital, but that aside, no real work for me, and no cost at all out of pocket.
[20/07/19, 9:01:56 AM] Sush: that‚Äôs amazing!
[20/07/19, 9:02:04 AM] Nikhil Dubai: I mean, I believe I have the ‚Äúgood‚Äù insurance, but even so.
[20/07/19, 9:02:52 AM] Sush: This wasn‚Äôt too terrible except that the ortho surgeon is v v busy and I was sitting on my MRI for nearly three weeks before I could see him
[20/07/19, 9:03:19 AM] Sush: and there were hoops to jump through for the MRI
[20/07/19, 9:03:34 AM] Sush: and it‚Äôs all pretty expensive even with pretty good insurance
[20/07/19, 9:03:56 AM] Sush: but American healthcare is such a shitshow
[20/07/19, 9:03:57 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Hmm?
[20/07/19, 9:04:04 AM] Sush: I take the absence of a disaster as a win
[20/07/19, 9:04:31 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Lol
‚Äé[20/07/19, 9:11:02 AM] Nikhil Dubai: ‚Äéimage omitted
[20/07/19, 10:30:05 AM] Nikhil Dubai: So I‚Äôm walking from where we live to where Mia is getting her hair done
[20/07/19, 10:30:26 AM] Nikhil Dubai: Which is about 30 minutes across a sea bridge + the beach
[20/07/19, 10:31:00 AM] Nikhil Dubai: But so hot! So humid!
[20/07/19, 10:31:12 AM] Sush: Ugggh
[20/07/19, 10:31:17 AM] Sush: I‚Äôm about to walk to brunch too
[20/07/19, 10:31:22 AM] Sush: And it‚Äôs SO HOT
[20/07/19, 10:31:40 AM] Nikhil Dubai: But vieeews
[20/07/19, 10:31:50 AM] Sush: FAIRüòÇ

[21/07/19, 12:26:50 PM] Sush: love this! i think dubai is probably more beautiful than i think it is
[30/07/19, 2:26:14 PM] Sush: questionnn
[30/07/19, 2:26:29 PM] Sush: oh time difference
[30/07/19, 2:26:33 PM] Sush: nvm
[30/07/19, 2:29:05 PM] Nikhil Dubai: No it‚Äôs only 1030
[30/07/19, 2:29:08 PM] Nikhil Dubai: What‚Äôs up?
[30/07/19, 2:29:19 PM] Sush: ohh lol i can't add
[30/07/19, 2:29:21 PM] Sush: SO
[30/07/19, 2:29:27 PM] Sush: we have two-person offices
[30/07/19, 2:29:35 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Ok?
[30/07/19, 2:29:38 PM] Sush: and i CANNOT anymore with the person i share with
[30/07/19, 2:29:43 PM] Sush: she's a GOOD and KIND person
[30/07/19, 2:29:48 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Ah :)
[30/07/19, 2:29:53 PM] Sush: but also hyper-anxious and noisy and fluttering constantly
[30/07/19, 2:30:11 PM] Sush: and it's _terrible_ for my productivity
[30/07/19, 2:30:23 PM] Sush: so we're moving to a different building in a couple of weeks
[30/07/19, 2:30:40 PM] Sush: should i just be like HEY so what if i shared will person Y instead? i think our working styles are more aligned
[30/07/19, 2:30:50 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Lol
[30/07/19, 2:30:51 PM] Sush: will i come off as uncooperative??
[30/07/19, 2:31:14 PM] Nikhil Dubai: What is ‚Äúuncooperative ‚Äú?
[30/07/19, 2:31:18 PM] Sush: i literally can't be around this anxious energy anymore
[30/07/19, 2:31:26 PM] Sush: like idk difficult to work with
[30/07/19, 2:31:44 PM] Sush: (also like not to be that bitch but we were in academic research - 99% of things are NOT urgent)
[30/07/19, 2:31:49 PM] Nikhil Dubai: But you‚Äôre not ‚Äúworking with‚Äù this person
[30/07/19, 2:31:49 PM] Sush: *work in
[30/07/19, 2:32:04 PM] Nikhil Dubai: You‚Äôre sharing an office with her
[30/07/19, 2:32:09 PM] Sush: no i work with her
[30/07/19, 2:32:27 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Ah. So do you need to discuss things together?
[30/07/19, 2:32:32 PM] Sush: person i share with - dawna , person i WANT to share with - dallas
[30/07/19, 2:32:36 PM] Sush: yeah, sometimes
[30/07/19, 2:32:44 PM] Sush: and we all 'work together' - like all 4 of us
[30/07/19, 2:32:54 PM] Sush: and she won't STOP talking about reports
[30/07/19, 2:32:57 PM] Sush: it drives me nuts
[30/07/19, 2:33:11 PM] Sush: and i can't do like 'science' if i'm interrupted CONSTANTLY
[30/07/19, 2:33:23 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Ok so then you‚Äôre not asking for anything that makes it harder for other people to work with you
[30/07/19, 2:33:34 PM] Sush: i'll do reports - comprehensively and on time - but i don't want to talk about them!
[30/07/19, 2:33:42 PM] Sush: no, i don't think i . am
[30/07/19, 2:34:02 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I thought you were going to ask if saying this would piss off dawna
[30/07/19, 2:34:11 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Which, I mean, I dunno
[30/07/19, 2:34:17 PM] Sush: it could, no?
[30/07/19, 2:34:19 PM] Nikhil Dubai: But uncooperative, I don‚Äôt think so
[30/07/19, 2:34:40 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Those are different things
[30/07/19, 2:34:39 PM] Sush: and i'd have to float the idea to andy (the prof) lol
[30/07/19, 2:34:45 PM] Sush: that is true
[30/07/19, 2:34:54 PM] Sush: dallas is so quiet
[30/07/19, 2:35:00 PM] Sush: and he's pleasant
[30/07/19, 2:35:07 PM] Sush: dawna's a great person too
[30/07/19, 2:35:08 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Dallas is a male name?
[30/07/19, 2:35:10 PM] Sush: yeah
[30/07/19, 2:35:24 PM] Sush: she's hardworking and sincere and *very* kind
[30/07/19, 2:35:30 PM] Sush: but the FLUTTERING ENERGY
[30/07/19, 2:37:16 PM] Sush: and i'm overqualified to just do REPORTS, you know?
[30/07/19, 2:37:35 PM] Sush: and andy's pushing me on my own research - so i *need* to be able to focus lol
[30/07/19, 2:38:07 PM] Sush: i like dawna a LOT and not sharing space with her would allow me to continue to lol
[30/07/19, 2:39:23 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Sorry there was an accidental voice note
[30/07/19, 2:39:29 PM] Sush: (it all sounds so petty in writing)
[30/07/19, 2:39:34 PM] Sush: haha i didn't receive it
[30/07/19, 2:39:38 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Wait, is she more senior?
[30/07/19, 2:39:51 PM] Sush: she is, she's a manager
[30/07/19, 2:39:55 PM] Sush: but i don't report to her
[30/07/19, 2:40:07 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Ah I see
[30/07/19, 2:40:22 PM] Sush: we both report to andy
[30/07/19, 2:40:36 PM] Sush: but she's a sr. program manager and has a phd
[30/07/19, 2:40:37 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Ok
[30/07/19, 2:40:53 PM] Sush: ALSO
[30/07/19, 2:41:05 PM] Sush: she keeps asking me for results!
[30/07/19, 2:41:08 PM] Sush: it's been THREE MONTHS
[30/07/19, 2:41:19 PM] Sush: into a GUN VIOLENCE REDUCTION program
[30/07/19, 2:41:22 PM] Sush: there are NONE
[30/07/19, 2:41:26 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Sorry but remind me again exactly what your role is right now? üòä
[30/07/19, 2:41:31 PM] Sush: data scientist
[30/07/19, 2:41:41 PM] Sush: whatever that means
[30/07/19, 2:41:46 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Sure but what does that mean exactly?
[30/07/19, 2:41:48 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Lol
[30/07/19, 2:41:56 PM] Sush: quantitative researcher, i guess?
[30/07/19, 2:42:01 PM] Sush: she does ethnography stuff
[30/07/19, 2:42:17 PM] Sush: i do or manage the quant research across all projects
[30/07/19, 2:42:38 PM] Sush: (i have undergrad/grad RAs)
[30/07/19, 2:42:58 PM] Sush: and project management
[30/07/19, 2:43:14 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Ok
[30/07/19, 2:43:37 PM] Sush: american busy olympics is EXHAUSTING
[30/07/19, 2:43:52 PM] Sush: she keeps asking me if i nothing to do lol
[30/07/19, 2:44:02 PM] Sush: i'm doing a LOT!
[30/07/19, 2:44:09 PM] Sush: i just don't FLUTTER while doing it
[30/07/19, 2:44:15 PM] Sush: (and i *can* tweet and code)
[30/07/19, 2:44:22 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Lol
[30/07/19, 2:45:05 PM] Sush: yesterday she passive-aggressively texted me at 1pm saying 'are u coming in today???'
[30/07/19, 2:45:23 PM] Sush: i'd been at a partner's office since 8 am lol
[30/07/19, 2:45:29 PM] Sush: with andy
[30/07/19, 2:46:03 PM] Sush: sorry i'm whining
[30/07/19, 2:46:12 PM] Sush: about pretty minor shit
[30/07/19, 2:46:47 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Ok, so from a hierarchical view, you‚Äôre essentially an independent service provider with specialized expertise and your own loose team of people that report to you, and she‚Äôs someone who does the more direct research whose work you facilitate?
[30/07/19, 2:47:24 PM] Nikhil Dubai: No that‚Äôs fine. I wish I had your problems, generally, but I also get how annoying it can be :)
[30/07/19, 2:48:33 PM] Sush: Actually, my work and her work have nothing to do with each other - except that along with ethnographic research, she handles grant / partner reporting so she has to ask me for updates on the statistics aspect of projects
[30/07/19, 2:48:52 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Ah ok
[30/07/19, 2:49:21 PM] Sush: Her research and mine don't feed into each other
[30/07/19, 2:49:29 PM] Nikhil Dubai: So even less of a quasi reporting relationship
[30/07/19, 2:49:41 PM] Sush: yeah!
[30/07/19, 2:50:17 PM] Sush: i hate busywork so much
[30/07/19, 2:50:44 PM] Sush: i *need* to be compensated for less pay with more autonomy l ol
[30/07/19, 2:50:55 PM] Sush: which i GET from my actual boss
[30/07/19, 2:54:04 PM] Sush: i will be so bad in corporate america i think lol
[30/07/19, 2:54:11 PM] Sush: or corporate anywhere maybe
[30/07/19, 2:54:44 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Corporate anywhere probably has similar issues, but you mostly get over it :)
[30/07/19, 2:55:02 PM] Sush: you're paid enough to get over it :P
[30/07/19, 2:55:12 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Lol true
‚Äé[30/07/19, 2:56:35 PM] Sush: ‚Äéimage omitted
[30/07/19, 2:56:47 PM] Sush: ugh it's so ugly here
[30/07/19, 2:57:00 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I do that on slides all the time :)
[30/07/19, 2:57:08 PM] Sush: üòÇ
[08/08/19, 3:40:49 PM] Sush: hii
[08/08/19, 3:41:04 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Hey!
[08/08/19, 3:41:12 PM] Sush: how are you?
[08/08/19, 3:41:19 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Good
[08/08/19, 3:41:33 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Somewhat of a rollercoaster couple of weeks :)
[08/08/19, 3:41:50 PM] Sush: oh yeah? what's up?
[08/08/19, 3:42:06 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Mostly random shit that‚Äôs not worth mentioning with distance :)
[08/08/19, 3:42:22 PM] Nikhil Dubai: How are you doing?
[08/08/19, 3:44:16 PM] Sush: Slightly similar actually
[08/08/19, 3:44:30 PM] Sush: I'm feeling v miserable today
[08/08/19, 3:44:40 PM] Nikhil Dubai: What happened?
[08/08/19, 3:44:45 PM] Sush: got a steroid shot for my neck yesterday and the pain's worse
[08/08/19, 3:44:54 PM] Sush: which is normal for ~ 48-72 hours apparently
[08/08/19, 3:45:01 PM] Sush: and here's the weird thing about pain
[08/08/19, 3:45:12 PM] Sush: there's nothing to DO or SAY about it
[08/08/19, 3:45:16 PM] Sush: it's just THERE, you know?
[08/08/19, 3:45:47 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Well, if you‚Äôre like me, you could just keep whining until your loved ones get annoyed :)
[08/08/19, 3:45:54 PM] Sush: but it gets in the way of everything and i feel resentful when people express SYMPATHY
[08/08/19, 3:45:58 PM] Sush: hahaha
[08/08/19, 3:46:20 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Btw, I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not as bad, but one of the many things that happened is my back being really weird
[08/08/19, 3:46:26 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Mild aches all the time
[08/08/19, 3:46:31 PM] Sush: i also get annoyed when people trivialize it
[08/08/19, 3:46:32 PM] Sush: uuuugh
[08/08/19, 3:46:49 PM] Sush: i hate to sound trite - but are you able to just WALK for 45-60 minutes a day?
[08/08/19, 3:46:55 PM] Sush: it frees up even my back
[08/08/19, 3:48:48 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Yeah? I‚Äôve not been working out at all recently, went once this week and just used the elliptical for 20 minutes but nothing else, don‚Äôt know how linked it is.
[08/08/19, 3:49:02 PM] Nikhil Dubai: How bad is your pain?
[08/08/19, 3:49:09 PM] Sush: it's so bad!!
[08/08/19, 3:49:18 PM] Sush: i was exhausted beyond the point of sleep yday i think
[08/08/19, 3:49:24 PM] Sush: the usual pain is worse
[08/08/19, 3:49:42 PM] Sush: and there's an added soreness from the injection site and the steroid is still being absorbed
[08/08/19, 3:49:47 PM] Sush: i thought i was going to die lol
[08/08/19, 3:50:07 PM] Sush: when they injected it - there was this huge pressure building up rapidly inside my shoulder and neck
[08/08/19, 3:50:16 PM] Sush: but then they said that's normal and it subsided slowly
[08/08/19, 3:51:14 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Oh wow
[08/08/19, 3:51:28 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Yeah mines nothing like that
[08/08/19, 3:52:22 PM] Sush: i think walking is really good for back related stuff because your posture straightens up
[08/08/19, 3:52:27 PM] Sush: and it's low impact
[08/08/19, 3:52:40 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I hear swimming also works? Will try tomorrow
[08/08/19, 3:52:46 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I have a whole week off!
[08/08/19, 3:52:53 PM] Sush: even if it resumes hurting when i'm back it hurts less while i'm walking
[08/08/19, 3:53:03 PM] Nikhil Dubai: And due to the previously mentioned rollercoaster I‚Äôm not going anywhere
[08/08/19, 3:53:03 PM] Sush: ooh yes! my doc said swimming on your back is v good
[08/08/19, 3:53:32 PM] Sush: ohho i think you'll be rest up nicely at home!
[08/08/19, 3:53:38 PM] Sush: take long walks, read books!
[08/08/19, 3:55:09 PM] Sush: ooh read 'i like to watch'
[08/08/19, 3:55:19 PM] Sush: it's a collection of essays by emily nussbaum on tv
[08/08/19, 3:55:23 PM] Sush: i'm enjoying it v much
[08/08/19, 3:55:36 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Yeah?
[08/08/19, 3:55:45 PM] Sush: i took the day off yesterday - i had to be in bed and not use my computer, so i actually read
[08/08/19, 3:56:16 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I actually haven‚Äôt read a ‚Äúreal‚Äù physical book in a while
[08/08/19, 3:56:29 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Lots on the phone or kindle, but no books
[08/08/19, 3:56:39 PM] Nikhil Dubai: They‚Äôre actually surprisingly expensive in Dubai anyway
[08/08/19, 3:56:59 PM] Sush: in america too!
[08/08/19, 3:57:12 PM] Sush: this is maybe only the second book i've bought in the US
[08/08/19, 3:58:58 PM] Sush: goodreads is telling me i've only read FIVE books ALL YEAR
[08/08/19, 4:00:09 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I‚Äôm playing the marvel spider man game on ps :)
[08/08/19, 4:00:39 PM] Sush: i basically have no idea what that is but you sound happy about it so yay! haha
[08/08/19, 4:01:14 PM] Sush: are you still blogging btw
[08/08/19, 4:01:18 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Haha it‚Äôs just a game, but it‚Äôs quite good
[08/08/19, 4:01:37 PM] Nikhil Dubai: No, but that was something I thought I would start again this break!
[08/08/19, 4:02:00 PM] Nikhil Dubai: So, I can‚Äôt actually write much on my own name if I want to be very honest
[08/08/19, 4:02:30 PM] Sush: i kinda want to to - both data sci stuff and (mostly) tv
[08/08/19, 4:02:41 PM] Sush: because professional thingies?
[08/08/19, 4:02:54 PM] Nikhil Dubai: But I‚Äôm considering doing a pseudonymous thing, essentially about consulting life in the Middle East, which if you think about it from a slightly distant perspective, is actually really weird!
[08/08/19, 4:03:25 PM] Sush: ooh i love the idea of that!
[08/08/19, 4:03:26 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Yes basically. I mean I could always write about random stuff
[08/08/19, 4:03:41 PM] Sush: i think that would be super interesting
[08/08/19, 4:04:13 PM] Sush: ok i started making this https://sushmitagopalan.com/
[08/08/19, 4:04:25 PM] Sush: 80% of it is the theme's default text lol
[08/08/19, 4:04:35 PM] Sush: but tell me if my bio is VERY LAME
[08/08/19, 4:04:43 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Ooh
[08/08/19, 4:04:53 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Wait what‚Äôs gencoin and why haven‚Äôt I heard about it yet?
[08/08/19, 4:05:02 PM] Sush: that's the theme's default text hahaha
[08/08/19, 4:05:11 PM] Nikhil Dubai: üòÅüòÅ
[08/08/19, 4:05:36 PM] Sush: with the photo and bio i'm going for RELIABLE GOOD GIRL
[08/08/19, 4:05:48 PM] Sush: which idk if anyone even cares about lol
[08/08/19, 4:06:48 PM] Sush: i have a handful of 80% complete little projects
[08/08/19, 4:06:53 PM] Sush: that i really should turn into posts
[08/08/19, 4:07:07 PM] Sush: i'll start job hunting after healing from surgery if i need to get it
[08/08/19, 4:07:29 PM] Sush: but i also want to write about tv and books and idk, being in my twenties
[08/08/19, 4:08:04 PM] Sush: i want to make it super low stakes
[08/08/19, 4:08:12 PM] Sush: barriers to posting should be v low
[08/08/19, 4:08:17 PM] Sush: i think you had a tumblr no?
[08/08/19, 4:12:11 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I did, yes
[08/08/19, 4:12:39 PM] Nikhil Dubai: You SHOULD write about tv and books and movies and being in your twenties
[08/08/19, 4:12:45 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I kind of miss doing that
[08/08/19, 4:13:01 PM] Nikhil Dubai: And I know I could, but I get this self censorship any time I think about it
[08/08/19, 4:13:07 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Like, ‚Äúthat just sounds dumb‚Äù
[08/08/19, 4:13:28 PM] Sush: no, it's totally not dumb! and we live in a time where we can make anything a statement :P
[08/08/19, 4:14:54 PM] Nikhil Dubai: True :)
[08/08/19, 4:15:40 PM] Sush: and like you said if you are uncomfortable make it pseudonymous
[08/08/19, 4:15:53 PM] Sush: but lol have i told you the story of this girl anu joshy in my class at insti
[08/08/19, 4:16:00 PM] Sush: who THOUGHT she had an anonymous blog
[08/08/19, 4:16:10 PM] Sush: lolol it was SO MEAN but also *very* funnt
[08/08/19, 4:16:12 PM] Sush: *funny
[08/08/19, 4:16:21 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Ooh tell
[08/08/19, 4:16:29 PM] Sush: she'd pour her heart out onto it thinking it was ANONYMOUS
[08/08/19, 4:16:36 PM] Sush: but somehow the whole class knew it was her
[08/08/19, 4:16:57 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Aww
[08/08/19, 4:17:00 PM] Sush: this was probably before text chains or anything lol but the moment she posted everyone would be alerted
[08/08/19, 4:17:07 PM] Sush: now i'm wondering if SHE was trolling us
[08/08/19, 4:17:08 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Haha
[08/08/19, 4:17:33 PM] Sush: she's write about members of the class with v thinly veiled references
[08/08/19, 4:18:02 PM] Sush: i don't think anyone ever told her we knew it was her
[08/08/19, 4:18:07 PM] Sush: i think she just got bored and stopped
[08/08/19, 4:18:27 PM] Nikhil Dubai: That‚Äôs so funny
[08/08/19, 4:18:42 PM] Sush: it was extremely entertaining
[08/08/19, 4:19:21 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I actually had a blog in high school that was never anonymous but I sort of pretended it was
[08/08/19, 4:19:40 PM] Sush: she was obsessed with siddharth - she wrote a poem about how he was a wayward shepherd and we were his docile and blind flock
[08/08/19, 4:19:42 PM] Sush: oh yeah?
[08/08/19, 4:19:46 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Then I told a friend about it and then everyone saw the weird shit I wrote about them
[08/08/19, 4:19:51 PM] Sush: lolol
[08/08/19, 4:20:00 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Hahaha
[08/08/19, 4:20:13 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Wait this is Insti?
[08/08/19, 4:20:16 PM] Sush: yeah!
[08/08/19, 4:20:19 PM] Sush: like first year
[08/08/19, 4:20:23 PM] Sush: when we ALL had blogs
[08/08/19, 4:21:07 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Haha
[08/08/19, 4:21:25 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Anu joshy sounds mallu?
[08/08/19, 4:21:36 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Do I know this person?
[08/08/19, 4:21:37 PM] Sush: yeah she is
[08/08/19, 4:21:56 PM] Sush: hmm i don't know!
[08/08/19, 4:22:34 PM] Sush: http://ofthelesserknown.blogspot.com/
[08/08/19, 4:22:43 PM] Sush: i can't remember if this was anonymous blog
[08/08/19, 4:22:55 PM] Sush: that she ended up claiming
[08/08/19, 4:26:19 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I‚Äôm just reading the excerpts and zoning out
[08/08/19, 4:26:28 PM] Sush: yeah don't bother
[08/08/19, 4:26:32 PM] Sush: it's a lot of rambling
[08/08/19, 4:28:00 PM] Sush: have you come across this whole quantified self movement
[08/08/19, 4:28:16 PM] Sush: https://quantifiedself.com/
[08/08/19, 4:28:43 PM] Sush: i am intrigued by it - even while feeling a lot of resistance towards productivity tracking type exercises
[08/08/19, 4:29:07 PM] Sush: i plotted my 'steps' since 2017 nov
[08/08/19, 4:29:30 PM] Sush: and of course it looks very seasonal - plummets in chicago winters and peaks in the summer
[08/08/19, 4:29:31 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Yes, actually
[08/08/19, 4:30:02 PM] Sush: but it does correlate with my general happiness i think and now i'm wondering if it's a good investment in my mental health to move someplace warmer (even tho i do ‚ù§ chicago)
‚Äé[08/08/19, 4:31:33 PM] Sush: ‚Äéimage omitted
[08/08/19, 4:31:38 PM] Nikhil Dubai: It‚Äôs kind of sad, but I do think there‚Äôs really not that many places with both great weather and great jobs
[08/08/19, 4:31:44 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Oh nice
[08/08/19, 4:31:44 PM] Sush: california!
[08/08/19, 4:32:09 PM] Sush: the LOWEST points are hyderabad lol
[08/08/19, 4:32:16 PM] Sush: i don't leave my house for days on end
[08/08/19, 4:32:26 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Haha
[08/08/19, 4:32:40 PM] Sush: my mom's rude - she saw it and said well i guess you walk from your bed to the jhoola and back
[08/08/19, 4:33:13 PM] Sush: maybe i should pull all my whatsapp texts and code them for sentiment
[08/08/19, 4:33:21 PM] Sush: can't think of another proxy for mood
[08/08/19, 4:33:30 PM] Sush: i also pulled my netflix viewing history
[08/08/19, 4:33:35 PM] Sush: it's so embarrassing
[08/08/19, 4:33:49 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I had to google jhoola, btw
[08/08/19, 4:34:04 PM] Sush: lol sorry :P what is it in mallu?
[08/08/19, 4:34:18 PM] Nikhil Dubai: No idea!
[08/08/19, 4:34:25 PM] Sush: oonjal in tamil
[08/08/19, 4:34:28 PM] Sush: =)
[08/08/19, 4:35:12 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Btw Mia has wanted something like this for our apartment since we first got it
[08/08/19, 4:35:23 PM] Nikhil Dubai: But I don‚Äôt know how we‚Äôll fit it
[08/08/19, 4:35:26 PM] Sush: ooh i'd highly recommend it
[08/08/19, 4:35:36 PM] Sush: it's such a fantastic reading spot
[08/08/19, 4:35:43 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Oonjal is mallu also for swing :)
[08/08/19, 4:35:50 PM] Sush: but i think you have to put in hooks at the time of construction
[08/08/19, 4:36:04 PM] Sush: or at least this is what we were told ~ 18 years ago
[08/08/19, 4:36:50 PM] Sush: saturday mornings i'd have the house to myself -parents at work, sister had college
[08/08/19, 4:37:10 PM] Sush: the jhoola was equidistant from snacks and the tv :P
[08/08/19, 4:37:22 PM] Sush: and i'd make sure i had an unread book
[08/08/19, 4:37:38 PM] Sush: lol it felt so decadent and wonderful
[08/08/19, 4:38:10 PM] Sush: when i was kid i'd draw under the plank
[08/08/19, 4:39:22 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Maybe we‚Äôll get it then :)
[08/08/19, 4:39:40 PM] Sush: i do love ours!
[08/08/19, 4:39:59 PM] Sush: it used to be in my dad's house in vellore
[08/08/19, 4:40:40 PM] Nikhil Dubai: You lived in vellore?
[08/08/19, 4:41:37 PM] Sush: No, my dad brought it to hyderabad when his mom sold the house in vellore
[08/08/19, 4:41:45 PM] Sush: My dad did, yeah
[08/08/19, 4:42:02 PM] Sush: I think i've only been once or twice - they sold the house when i was like 2
[08/08/19, 4:43:59 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Ah ok
[08/08/19, 4:44:11 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Is your dad originally from there?
[08/08/19, 4:44:37 PM] Sush: kind of? my grandfather worked with malaria control for the WHO so they moved a loot
[08/08/19, 4:45:19 PM] Sush: but he did spend a sizable part of his childhood in vellore - when he and his siblings were old enough to not interrupt school they stayed put in vellore
[08/08/19, 4:47:49 PM] Nikhil Dubai: My cousins live there
[08/08/19, 4:48:05 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Although I haven‚Äôt been in ages
[08/08/19, 4:49:23 PM] Sush: did you visit from insti?
[08/08/19, 4:49:44 PM] Sush: one of my aunts splits her time between vellore and san francisco but i've never visited her
[11/08/19, 3:16:03 PM] Sush: How's your staycation?
[11/08/19, 3:16:19 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Hey!
[11/08/19, 3:16:31 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Sorry, kind of blanked out and then slept off the other day
[11/08/19, 3:16:46 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Good, but we‚Äôre going to do the healthier version starting tomorrow
[11/08/19, 3:16:50 PM] Nikhil Dubai: More gym less booze
[11/08/19, 3:17:19 PM] Nikhil Dubai: How are you doing?
[11/08/19, 3:18:21 PM] Sush: Haha :)
[11/08/19, 3:18:47 PM] Sush: I'm okay! My back still feels very sore
[11/08/19, 3:19:09 PM] Sush: so i have to be home and that's making me irritable and making me BROOD
[11/08/19, 3:19:39 PM] Sush: am I just watching my twenties slip past?!
[11/08/19, 3:19:55 PM] Sush: i'm stuck in a rut!
[11/08/19, 3:20:33 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Brood on what?
[11/08/19, 3:20:44 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Ha!
[11/08/19, 3:21:13 PM] Sush: everything!
[11/08/19, 3:21:34 PM] Sush: remember the 35 year old mikhail was seeing when we were 'poly' ?
[11/08/19, 3:21:39 PM] Nikhil Dubai: (I say ‚Äúha!‚Äù listening to the single girl a year out of grad school tell me this, but I also realize I‚Äôm, like, 3 years older, so make of that what you will)
[11/08/19, 3:21:40 PM] Sush: they're still seeing each other!!!
[11/08/19, 3:22:04 PM] Sush: she lives in ITALY
[11/08/19, 3:22:06 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I remember this whole poly discussion but no specific 35 year old, actually
[11/08/19, 3:22:10 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Oh wow
[11/08/19, 3:22:15 PM] Sush: they visit each other!
[11/08/19, 3:22:19 PM] Sush: it's been > 2 years!
[11/08/19, 3:22:27 PM] Sush: i look at her instagram EVERYDAY lol
[11/08/19, 3:22:33 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Hahaha
[11/08/19, 3:22:35 PM] Sush: and she's in chicago this week
[11/08/19, 3:23:35 PM] Sush: i don't even miss mikhail or anything
[11/08/19, 3:23:46 PM] Sush: but i'm constantly measuring myself against this woman
[11/08/19, 3:23:53 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Hmm?
[11/08/19, 3:23:53 PM] Sush: even two years later
[11/08/19, 3:24:13 PM] Sush: i think i'm prettier and younger (i hate myself for even saying this)
[11/08/19, 3:24:25 PM] Sush: but in every other way, _I'D_ rather date her than me!
[11/08/19, 3:24:32 PM] Sush: she has a functioning spine, for one!
[11/08/19, 3:24:32 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Lol. Why?
[11/08/19, 3:24:41 PM] Nikhil Dubai: üòí
[11/08/19, 3:25:04 PM] Sush: acc to her instagram, they swam in the lake, biked through the woods and cooked a persian dinner
[11/08/19, 3:25:16 PM] Sush: he wooed me with a persian dinner!
[11/08/19, 3:25:20 PM] Sush: i can't BIKE
[11/08/19, 3:25:26 PM] Sush: and my back hurts all the time
[11/08/19, 3:25:30 PM] Sush: i can't be fun and exciting!
[11/08/19, 3:25:42 PM] Sush: (see - 20s just passing by)
[11/08/19, 3:26:34 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Ok, that does admittedly suck. On the other hand, I‚Äôm not doing any of that either.
[11/08/19, 3:26:55 PM] Sush: üò≠üò≠üò≠
[11/08/19, 3:27:09 PM] Sush: is this social media fomo? idk
[11/08/19, 3:27:12 PM] Nikhil Dubai: My point being, I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a lot more things you can do that you can‚Äôt do
[11/08/19, 3:27:14 PM] Sush: i had a beach day yesterday too
[11/08/19, 3:27:26 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Also yes, social media is really good at inducing fomo
[11/08/19, 3:27:38 PM] Nikhil Dubai: You did? In Chicago? :-/
[11/08/19, 3:27:52 PM] Sush: hey! lake michigan is huge!
[11/08/19, 3:27:57 PM] Sush: we have legit beaches!
[11/08/19, 3:28:00 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Lol ok
[11/08/19, 3:28:04 PM] Sush: with sand and waves and everything :P
[11/08/19, 3:28:24 PM] Sush: i mean - it looks like this half the year https://www.instagram.com/p/BtZ3JucgRrh/
[11/08/19, 3:28:46 PM] Sush: but still :P
‚Äé[11/08/19, 3:29:18 PM] Sush: ‚Äéimage omitted
[11/08/19, 3:33:57 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Hey, looks like a beach :)
[11/08/19, 3:34:30 PM] Sush: it IS :P
[11/08/19, 3:34:54 PM] Nikhil Dubai: So I had a ton of noodles and shrimp and rice and Thai curry
[11/08/19, 3:35:10 PM] Nikhil Dubai: But now I‚Äôm making myself a grilled cheese
[11/08/19, 3:35:22 PM] Sush: üòÇ i feel you
[11/08/19, 3:35:24 PM] Nikhil Dubai: For no reason other than I‚Äôm watching a cooking show with a grilled cheese in it
[11/08/19, 3:35:47 PM] Sush: ohh i'm loving a grilled cheese with pesto and goat cheese right now
[11/08/19, 3:35:52 PM] Sush: SO GOOD
[11/08/19, 3:35:58 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Wish I had some pesto actually
[11/08/19, 3:36:14 PM] Sush: i made some a couple of weeks ago!
[11/08/19, 3:36:27 PM] Sush: it's very easy and well worth the effort i think
[11/08/19, 3:36:41 PM] Sush: i used almonds though, i didn't have pine nuts
[11/08/19, 3:37:43 PM] Sush: there was a time people thought MY LIFE was cool on insta!!
[11/08/19, 3:37:56 PM] Sush: i'm feeling like 'post more' isn't the solution to this feeling though lol
[11/08/19, 3:37:58 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Haha I still think your life is pretty cool :)
[11/08/19, 3:38:23 PM] Sush: i think that's just a case of the grass being greener on the other side!
[11/08/19, 3:38:44 PM] Sush: i guess i really mean this - i've become lazy and bad about making the effort to do things i enjoy
[11/08/19, 3:39:17 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I believe that‚Äôs a pretty common feeling
[11/08/19, 3:39:22 PM] Nikhil Dubai: At least, I have it a lot
[11/08/19, 3:39:38 PM] Sush: how do we break out of it????
[11/08/19, 3:39:45 PM] Sush: how to break bad patterns??
[11/08/19, 3:39:49 PM] Sush: i have SO MANY lol
[11/08/19, 3:43:11 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I‚Äôm trying to remember all the self help advice on this
[11/08/19, 3:43:26 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Mostly, baby steps?
[11/08/19, 3:43:29 PM] Sush: i googled 'i'm in a rut help' - it was not helpful
[11/08/19, 3:43:48 PM] Sush: ugh yeah youre right
[11/08/19, 3:44:17 PM] Sush: that's basically it lol - how do i more exciting things? do them
[11/08/19, 3:47:04 PM] Nikhil Dubai: üòä
[11/08/19, 3:47:33 PM] Sush: sorry for being a RAY OF SUNSHINE lol
[11/08/19, 3:47:41 PM] Sush: Does Mia have the week off too?
[11/08/19, 3:53:39 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Ish
[11/08/19, 3:54:08 PM] Nikhil Dubai: We have time, but she may have some calls
[12/08/19, 2:34:01 PM] Nikhil Dubai: So I made a whole meal for the first time in ages and am glowing with accomplishment
[12/08/19, 2:43:15 PM] Sush: ooh! what did you make?
[12/08/19, 2:43:38 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Pesto chicken and roasted carrots, peppers and onions
[12/08/19, 2:43:54 PM] Sush: v cool!!
‚Äé[12/08/19, 2:44:12 PM] Sush: ‚ÄéGIF omitted
[12/08/19, 2:44:49 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Mia said it tasted good and a lot better than she expected even though she doesn‚Äôt know if it was worth all the effort üòÖ
[12/08/19, 2:45:04 PM] Sush: hahaha :)
[12/08/19, 2:46:41 PM] Nikhil Dubai: It was actually not bad, I think, and I know how to fix what I did wrong for next time, so happy overall :)
[12/08/19, 2:48:02 PM] Sush: awesome! did you enjoy the process?
[12/08/19, 2:48:46 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Mostly?
[12/08/19, 2:48:55 PM] Sush: fair üòÇ
[12/08/19, 2:49:07 PM] Sush: cleaning and chopping onions are always the WORST imo
[12/08/19, 2:49:36 PM] Sush: incidentally, i roasted carrots yesterday!
[12/08/19, 2:49:49 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Actually the onions were probably not strictly required. Most painful to cut, stank up the place, and didn‚Äôt add THAT much to the flavor
[12/08/19, 2:50:10 PM] Sush: they really are painful to cut
[12/08/19, 2:50:17 PM] Sush: i also hate cutting sweet potato
[12/08/19, 2:50:30 PM] Sush: tomatoes are my FAV to cut lol
[12/08/19, 2:50:34 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Yeah?
[12/08/19, 2:50:44 PM] Sush: ya they're so HARD
[12/08/19, 2:51:06 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Better to cut after boiling/roasting, then?
[12/08/19, 2:51:12 PM] Sush: yes for sure
[12/08/19, 2:51:32 PM] Sush: i had no idea roasting vegetables took this long
[12/08/19, 2:51:39 PM] Sush: before i started using an oven
[12/08/19, 2:52:15 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Yeah but the thing with the oven is you get to just leave it and do your thing, right?
[12/08/19, 2:52:22 PM] Nikhil Dubai: As opposed to frying or saut√©ing
[12/08/19, 2:52:30 PM] Sush: that's true
[12/08/19, 2:52:41 PM] Sush: it's so much faster if you parboil veggies though
[12/08/19, 2:52:49 PM] Sush: idk - my mom doesn't like when i do it
[12/08/19, 2:53:07 PM] Sush: but just microwaving for 4 minutes before going into the oven i think cooks the insides
[12/08/19, 2:53:26 PM] Sush: and then it can just focus on becoming a little charred and crisp and delicious lol
[12/08/19, 2:53:48 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Interesting
[12/08/19, 2:54:28 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I finally got amazon prime so I‚Äôm watching American gods now btw
[12/08/19, 2:54:39 PM] Sush: watch fleabag first!!!!!
‚Äé[12/08/19, 2:55:20 PM] Sush: ‚ÄéGIF omitted
[12/08/19, 2:55:38 PM] Nikhil Dubai: That good, is it?
[12/08/19, 2:55:48 PM] Sush: yes!
[12/08/19, 2:55:58 PM] Sush: not to hype it up too much, but yes :P
[12/08/19, 2:56:04 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I wanted something dramatic and in a way safer, since I‚Äôm not sure how I‚Äôd take the humour
[12/08/19, 2:56:38 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Some of these really vary
[12/08/19, 2:56:45 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Like, have you watched Bojack yet?
[12/08/19, 2:56:52 PM] Sush: the humour on fleabag is p absurd
[12/08/19, 2:56:59 PM] Sush: but also very organic to the storyline
[12/08/19, 2:57:03 PM] Sush: no I haven't!
[12/08/19, 2:57:11 PM] Sush: I'm actually a little afraid of watching that lol
[12/08/19, 2:57:55 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I remember somewhat reveling in the self destructiveness while binge watching season 3
[12/08/19, 2:58:17 PM] Nikhil Dubai: But that‚Äôs a show that‚Äôs better than almost anything else i‚Äôve seen but will not be for everyone
[12/08/19, 2:58:33 PM] Sush: i definitely want to watch at some point
[12/08/19, 2:58:51 PM] Sush: fleabag also has uplifting moments, tbh
[12/08/19, 2:59:09 PM] Sush: oh i bought Circe yesterday, based partly on your goodreads
[12/08/19, 2:59:21 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Yeah?
[12/08/19, 3:01:12 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Emily browning is surprisingly good in it
[12/08/19, 3:01:38 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Also this storyline is somewhat different from the book and therefore a genuinely surprising part so maybe it‚Äôs that also
[12/08/19, 3:01:52 PM] Nikhil Dubai: *it=American gods
[12/08/19, 3:04:18 PM] Sush: ohh i'm curious
[12/08/19, 3:04:27 PM] Sush: it's been 4-5 years since i've read the book
[12/08/19, 3:04:59 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Show is fairly faithful otherwise and a tad overdramatized to be honest
[12/08/19, 3:29:13 PM] Sush: ugh i'm trying to write the methods section of a proposal
[12/08/19, 3:29:18 PM] Sush: and i'm soooooo bored
[12/08/19, 3:29:36 PM] Sush: please remind me of this the next time i say 'MAYBE i'll just get a phd'
[12/08/19, 3:30:13 PM] Sush: the book itself is a tad overdramatized, no? :P
[12/08/19, 3:30:35 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Lol true
[12/08/19, 3:31:45 PM] Nikhil Dubai: How do these things go usually?
[12/08/19, 3:32:29 PM] Sush: i mean, i just don't find writing papers interesting at all i think lol
[12/08/19, 3:32:56 PM] Sush: it's fine though - i'm just outlining some methods we're proposing to use to address a question
[12/08/19, 3:34:37 PM] Sush: i'll typically draft it and my professor incorporates it into his narrative
[12/08/19, 3:34:52 PM] Sush: he's a v compelling writer and an EXCELLENT speaker
[12/08/19, 3:34:55 PM] Sush: he's so so good
[12/08/19, 3:50:13 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Sounds not much worse than my job, at least
[12/08/19, 3:51:02 PM] Sush: yeah it really is not bad at all lol
[12/08/19, 3:51:29 PM] Sush: it's just a BEAUTIFUL day outside and i'm dying to go to the beach
[12/08/19, 3:51:58 PM] Nikhil Dubai: So, like, what would you do, really, at the beach?
[12/08/19, 3:52:30 PM] Sush: swim / read a book since i'd go by myself today
[12/08/19, 3:52:37 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I ask because I live next to one, and of course it‚Äôs way too hot here, but it looks like everyone‚Äôs having so much fun there but I‚Äôm not sure if I would enjoy BEING there all that much
[12/08/19, 3:52:37 PM] Sush: i'm allowed to swim on my back lol
[12/08/19, 3:53:10 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I plan on spending tomorrow morning at my gym + pool overlooking the beach, so I guess that‚Äôs close
[12/08/19, 3:53:16 PM] Sush: also i think i could stand in the water and let waves wash over my feet for like TWO HOURS without getting bored
[12/08/19, 3:53:22 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Yeah?
[12/08/19, 3:53:45 PM] Sush: yeah! i'll sometimes just walk to the water listening to a podcast and just let the waves come
[12/08/19, 3:54:11 PM] Sush: it helps that it's not hot, for sure
[12/08/19, 3:54:23 PM] Sush: but it's also warm enough that the water feels great
[12/08/19, 3:54:37 PM] Sush: ALSO it really helps that it is freshwater!
[12/08/19, 3:54:46 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Lol fair
[12/08/19, 3:55:03 PM] Sush: i could stop by the beach omw to work
[12/08/19, 3:55:22 PM] Sush: i talked to my sister also today
[12/08/19, 3:55:29 PM] Sush: about feeling like i'm in a rut etc
[12/08/19, 3:55:42 PM] Sush: she strongly recommended a creative outlet lol
[12/08/19, 3:55:52 PM] Sush: so i'm in the market for a HOBBY lol
[12/08/19, 3:56:29 PM] Sush: i 100% feel this way about CONCERTS
[12/08/19, 3:56:36 PM] Sush: like what do i do with my HANDS?
[12/08/19, 3:56:47 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Haha I actually like concerts
[12/08/19, 3:56:57 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Why do you have to do anything wirh your hands?
[12/08/19, 3:57:10 PM] Nikhil Dubai: So I started doing morning pages today
[12/08/19, 3:57:12 PM] Sush: they just lie by your side?
[12/08/19, 3:57:21 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Sure?
[12/08/19, 3:57:29 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Or dance if you want
[12/08/19, 3:57:34 PM] Sush: ooh how was that?
[12/08/19, 3:57:42 PM] Sush: but SO AWKWARD
[12/08/19, 3:57:53 PM] Sush: i feel paralyzed lol
[12/08/19, 3:57:58 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Depends on the music I think
[12/08/19, 3:58:09 PM] Sush: this is why i like to go to kacheris in chennai :P
[12/08/19, 3:58:17 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Really just writing our random stuff in the morning
[12/08/19, 3:58:29 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Was supposed to spur me to more creative output but didn‚Äôt entirely
[12/08/19, 3:58:41 PM] Sush: you know what to do with your hands! and there's no need to perform your appreciation of the music or like, be sexy in the process idk
[12/08/19, 3:59:15 PM] Sush: concerts feel like a #hotgirl activity to me in a way i don't know how to participate lol
[12/08/19, 4:00:05 PM] Sush: there'll probably be a few false starts!
[12/08/19, 4:00:08 PM] Nikhil Dubai: So the hot girls etc are definitely part of the attraction of, if not concerts in general, music festivals, which is also a thing that I love even though I know it‚Äôs a bit cliche
[12/08/19, 4:00:45 PM] Sush: i don't think i've even been to a music festival
[12/08/19, 4:00:53 PM] Sush: also 95% of the music i listen to is south asian
[12/08/19, 4:00:58 PM] Sush: so i feel slightly fish out of water
[12/08/19, 4:01:04 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Fair
[12/08/19, 4:03:18 PM] Sush: I did tell a friend i'd go swing dancing with her next week!
[12/08/19, 4:03:31 PM] Nikhil Dubai: That sounds fun!
[12/08/19, 4:03:31 PM] Sush: it sounds low key and fun and there's a little lesson before
[12/08/19, 4:03:55 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Swing is the only thing I remember from our dancing lessons
[12/08/19, 4:04:10 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Also the easiest thing to dance to for a surprising number of songs
[12/08/19, 4:04:10 PM] Sush: when did you take dancing lessons? :)
[12/08/19, 4:04:21 PM] Sush: so true!
[12/08/19, 4:04:32 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Took a few with Mia in LA right after marriage
[12/08/19, 4:04:47 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Ok, it‚Äôs 1 am and I planned to wake up early and gym etc
[12/08/19, 4:04:55 PM] Sush: so cute! i love that
[12/08/19, 4:05:00 PM] Sush: this
[12/08/19, 4:05:03 PM] Sush: not this
[12/08/19, 4:05:07 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Lol
[12/08/19, 4:05:09 PM] Sush: alrighty, ttyl!
[12/08/19, 4:05:20 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Gn!
[12/08/19, 4:05:35 PM] Sush: üåøüåø
[12/08/19, 4:05:41 PM] Nikhil Dubai: ?
[15/08/19, 11:41:13 AM] Nikhil Dubai: So still not watching fleabag
[15/08/19, 11:41:37 AM] Nikhil Dubai: But randomly tried marvelous Mrs Maisel and feel like I‚Äôm falling in love with Rachel Brosnahan
[15/08/19, 11:55:36 AM] Sush: üòäüòä
[15/08/19, 11:55:44 AM] Sush: i have mixed feelings about that show :P
[15/08/19, 11:55:58 AM] Sush: but yeah rachel brosnahan is pretty great!
[15/08/19, 12:16:51 PM] Nikhil Dubai: What mixed feelings?
[15/08/19, 12:18:08 PM] Sush: i think the writing around her has a lot of the same pitfalls as rory gilmore
[15/08/19, 12:18:27 PM] Nikhil Dubai: That sounds very plausible, actually
[15/08/19, 12:18:27 PM] Sush: i liked s1 and then in s2, i was just tired
[15/08/19, 12:18:29 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Go on?
[15/08/19, 12:18:38 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Ah. Still on episode 3
[15/08/19, 12:18:43 PM] Sush: she has basically no losses
[15/08/19, 12:18:53 PM] Sush: ok i won't spoiler!
[15/08/19, 12:19:05 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Rory had losses no?
[15/08/19, 12:19:10 PM] Sush: (is that a verb? it should be)
[15/08/19, 12:19:16 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Also I‚Äôm kind of in the mood for unmitigated triumph
[15/08/19, 12:19:21 PM] Sush: but they all ended up validating her in some way :P
[15/08/19, 12:19:35 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Hmm
[15/08/19, 12:19:40 PM] Sush: jess broke up with you? he still loves you for changing his life
[15/08/19, 12:19:46 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Lol
[15/08/19, 12:19:59 PM] Sush: and their general disinterest in other women :P
[15/08/19, 12:20:25 PM] Nikhil Dubai: In the Netflix reboot the dude was basically engaged to someone else throughout
[15/08/19, 12:20:28 PM] Nikhil Dubai: No?
[15/08/19, 12:20:35 PM] Sush: he was
[15/08/19, 12:20:40 PM] Sush: and still obsessed with her
[15/08/19, 12:20:51 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Eh
[15/08/19, 12:21:00 PM] Sush: oh, i mean logan
[15/08/19, 12:21:17 PM] Sush: he was still sleeping with her, still showing up in the middle of the night to surprise her
[15/08/19, 12:21:19 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Yes. I forgot the name
[15/08/19, 12:21:28 PM] Sush: and _she_ said she wouldn't marry him
[15/08/19, 12:21:35 PM] Nikhil Dubai: She did?
[15/08/19, 12:21:45 PM] Sush: yeah - at the end of the original show
[15/08/19, 12:21:47 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Confession, I gave up the original around season 4 or 5
[15/08/19, 12:21:51 PM] Sush: good call
[15/08/19, 12:21:58 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Why?
[15/08/19, 12:22:08 PM] Sush: why did she say no?
[15/08/19, 12:22:17 PM] Sush: because she wanted to find herself something something
[15/08/19, 12:22:31 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Of course
[15/08/19, 12:22:45 PM] Sush: rory and midge are both not very nice women
[15/08/19, 12:22:47 PM] Sush: which is fine
[15/08/19, 12:23:04 PM] Sush: except that the show is screaming that they are
[15/08/19, 12:23:13 PM] Sush: midge is still better than rory i think :P
[15/08/19, 12:23:21 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Midge seems kind of great so far actually
[15/08/19, 12:23:43 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Rory seemed fundamentally nice if given to flights of fancy
[15/08/19, 12:23:43 PM] Sush: she is in s1, actually!
[15/08/19, 12:23:52 PM] Sush: even in s2, she's mostly ok
[15/08/19, 12:24:01 PM] Sush: noooo rory is SO self-involved
[15/08/19, 12:24:10 PM] Sush: and so 'i'm not like other girls'
[15/08/19, 12:24:17 PM] Sush: that fat shaming sequence in the reboot
[15/08/19, 12:24:27 PM] Sush: her disdain of the '30 something club'
[15/08/19, 12:24:42 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Isn‚Äôt she 30 in the reboot? :-/
[15/08/19, 12:24:58 PM] Nikhil Dubai: I clearly don‚Äôt remember that show as well as I thought I did
[15/08/19, 12:27:34 PM] Sush: rory's the worrrst haha
[15/08/19, 12:27:49 PM] Sush: she's a pretty terrible friend to Lane
[15/08/19, 12:27:55 PM] Sush: give me Paris / Lane any day
[15/08/19, 12:28:38 PM] Nikhil Dubai: Lane is the Asian chick?
[15/08/19, 12:28:41 PM] Sush: yep
