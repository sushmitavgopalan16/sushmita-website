[10/12/17, 7:40:58 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Not here in Rajasthan, I dunno if it's lack of interest in pursuing family business among women or something else
[10/12/17, 7:41:40 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Interesting is didige Reddy?
[10/12/17, 7:41:46 PM] Sush: Maybe lack of social sanction for it?
[10/12/17, 7:41:50 PM] Sush: Didige actually isn't
[10/12/17, 7:42:05 PM] Sush: But also know a lot of reddy girls who do nothing

[10/12/17, 7:44:02 PM] Riddhima Chicago: My dad has a business of his own, it isn't that big and also I am not interested

[10/12/17, 7:50:05 PM] Riddhima Chicago: But its like if you expand the same business you are in a different ball game
[10/12/17, 7:50:16 PM] Riddhima Chicago: I think it could also be the scale

[10/12/17, 8:44:00 PM] Sush: Ya actually insti must be higher end of public universities
[10/12/17, 8:44:20 PM] Riddhima Chicago: I like it the public uni system in our country sometimes
[10/12/17, 8:44:32 PM] Sush: Ya it's great
[10/12/17, 8:44:36 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Because if we compare other foreign students in the US
[10/12/17, 8:44:42 PM] Riddhima Chicago: They are mostly from Rich families
[10/12/17, 8:44:47 PM] Sush: Except for this crazy idea that you have to choose a major when you're SEVENTEEN
[10/12/17, 8:45:06 PM] Riddhima Chicago: For instance Mexicans, at least at Harris 90% Mexicans are super rich
[10/12/17, 8:45:09 PM] Sush: I actually really wish I had done undergrad in the US

[10/12/17, 8:45:30 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Yea I feel the same
[10/12/17, 8:45:37 PM] Sush: Even all Chinese kids are damn rich
[10/12/17, 8:45:49 PM] Sush: Also a reflection of inequality in their countries
[10/12/17, 8:46:08 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Yea those are coming from the bureaucratic famalies
[10/12/17, 8:46:14 PM] Riddhima Chicago: True

[10/12/17, 8:47:19 PM] Riddhima Chicago: On a serious note it's good
[10/12/17, 8:47:52 PM] Riddhima Chicago: But quality is also linked with money
[10/12/17, 8:48:02 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Like all top universities in the us are private
[10/12/17, 8:49:16 PM] Sush: True!!
[10/12/17, 8:49:47 PM] Sush: But also you know the quality of education in an average US university is way better than an average university in India
[10/12/17, 8:50:16 PM] Sush: In India if we don't go to one of the elite schools, life gets harder nai?
[10/12/17, 8:50:32 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Ask me I didn't go to an elite one
[10/12/17, 8:50:38 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Totally agree it sucks
[10/12/17, 8:50:49 PM] Riddhima Chicago: You gotta work harder and what not
[10/12/17, 8:51:06 PM] Sush: Ya I'm sure you would've had to prove yourself a little more after that
[10/12/17, 8:51:35 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Yea and it's also like because you don't carry a brand name
[10/12/17, 8:51:43 PM] Sush: True
[10/12/17, 8:51:53 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Your smartness is all your work, so it comes latter
[10/12/17, 8:52:04 PM] Sush: However much I complain about my degree, the brand has def helped
[10/12/17, 8:52:29 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Hmm I still feel very previledge
[10/12/17, 8:52:42 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Because I was studying with people who were as smart as I was
[10/12/17, 8:52:45 PM] Sush: That toh we are
[10/12/17, 8:52:52 PM] Sush: Ya that makes a huge difference
[10/12/17, 8:53:02 PM] Riddhima Chicago: But didn't have the same quality of school education as a foundation
[10/12/17, 8:53:10 PM] Riddhima Chicago: As I had

[10/12/17, 11:54:18 PM] Sush: Because other people have helped me out when I was in need :P
[10/12/17, 11:55:18 PM] Riddhima Chicago: He ate divya's food from the fridge in Harris once
[10/12/17, 11:55:26 PM] Riddhima Chicago: He has many stories

[18/12/17, 1:52:26 AM] Riddhima Chicago: Attraction is a very normal thing, to be attracted to multiple people. Main thing is how you are with people that you commit with for which one needs maturity

[18/02/18, 2:17:13 PM] Sush: so we watched masaan together last night
[18/02/18, 2:17:21 PM] Sush: and it was really nice
[18/02/18, 2:17:30 PM] Sush: and then he kissed me etc
[18/02/18, 2:17:53 PM] Sush: but it was all very chaste it was just kissing nothing else
[18/02/18, 2:18:01 PM] Sush: Buuuuut I don’t want that to happen again
[18/02/18, 2:18:06 PM] Sush: and I don’t want to date

[19/02/18, 3:16:39 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Hey in which department did you take the database class?
[19/02/18, 3:16:48 PM] Sush: CS
[19/02/18, 3:16:57 PM] Sush: i was just going to message you actually
[19/02/18, 3:17:05 PM] Sush: put your name on your pull request :P
[19/02/18, 3:17:09 PM] Sush: not github handle
[19/02/18, 3:17:30 PM] Riddhima Chicago: So send the pull request again?
[19/02/18, 3:17:35 PM] Sush: the whole point is that we grade on canvas which has your real name - and your github has your handle - so, to make it searchable
[19/02/18, 3:17:39 PM] Sush: nah, you can just edit the name
[19/02/18, 3:17:54 PM] Sush: it won't affect your grade obviously
[19/02/18, 3:17:58 PM] Sush: just for ease of grading
[19/02/18, 3:18:04 PM] Sush: nice job on pset4 btw!
[19/02/18, 3:18:06 PM] Sush: 9.5
[19/02/18, 3:18:20 PM] Sush: don't mention haha i haven't finished all - so grades won't appear
[19/02/18, 3:18:39 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Haha
[19/02/18, 3:18:45 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Alright and edited the name
[19/02/18, 3:18:54 PM] Sush: thanksss ❤
[19/02/18, 3:18:59 PM] Sush: it's just easier if it is searchable
[19/02/18, 3:18:59 PM] Riddhima Chicago: I think I am still not clear with the pull requests formats
[19/02/18, 3:19:07 PM] Sush: i'll show you when i see you
[19/02/18, 3:19:14 PM] Sush: you want to take databases?
[19/02/18, 3:19:18 PM] Sush: it's a fairly easy class
[19/02/18, 3:19:33 PM] Sush: it's  not too hard or time consuming but i found it quite useful
[19/02/18, 3:19:44 PM] Sush: the one i took is in MPCS
[19/02/18, 3:19:46 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Yea SQL is useful

[19/02/18, 3:20:47 PM] Sush: it wasn't offered in fall
[19/02/18, 3:20:52 PM] Sush: what else are you taking?
[19/02/18, 3:21:49 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Machine learning
[19/02/18, 3:21:59 PM] Sush: i'm most likely doing natural language processing, empirical topics in social insurance and data engineering platforms for analytics - but i suspect at least 1 will change after shoppinh
[19/02/18, 3:22:06 PM] Sush: rayid ghani?
[19/02/18, 3:22:16 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Yea

[19/02/18, 3:22:35 PM] Riddhima Chicago: For 3rd one I have to talk to my gphap certificate director
[19/02/18, 3:22:52 PM] Sush: how come you want to do ML?
[19/02/18, 3:23:00 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Coz there is a mandatory class for that n I don't wanna do that
[19/02/18, 3:23:39 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Enjoying the comp stuff so far and it counts for data analytics certificate
[19/02/18, 3:24:41 PM] Sush: acha nice - makes sense!
[19/02/18, 3:24:48 PM] Sush: and it's taught in python only no
[19/02/18, 3:29:15 PM] Riddhima Chicago: I dunno that
[19/02/18, 3:29:29 PM] Sush: ya it is
[19/02/18, 3:29:30 PM] Riddhima Chicago: But I am kinda agnostic now between r and python
[19/02/18, 3:29:32 PM] Sush: rodrigo took it
[19/02/18, 3:29:36 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Okay
[19/02/18, 3:29:47 PM] Sush: and also the data science for social good group generally prefers python i think
[19/02/18, 3:29:59 PM] Sush: ya same
[19/02/18, 3:30:13 PM] Sush: rick evans hates the fact that i'm using R for my thesis work lol
[19/02/18, 3:30:26 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Is it a center? Heard the name couple of.times now
[19/02/18, 3:30:32 PM] Sush: ya!
[19/02/18, 3:30:47 PM] Sush: based out of harris and computation institute together i think
[19/02/18, 3:30:48 PM] Riddhima Chicago: I sort of like r more
[19/02/18, 3:31:00 PM] Sush: ya i find r convenient for modeling stuff
[19/02/18, 3:31:13 PM] Sush: python is a more general purpose language i guesss
[19/02/18, 3:31:21 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Hmm
[20/02/18, 7:31:55 AM] Sush: Heyyy
[20/02/18, 7:31:58 AM] Sush: Listen

[20/02/18, 9:31:51 AM] Riddhima Chicago: I think there are two ways
[20/02/18, 9:32:09 AM] Riddhima Chicago: 1. Either be very explicit that you wanna know about that org
[20/02/18, 9:32:33 AM] Riddhima Chicago: Usually I do it if I have something in common with that person other than work like uchicago alumni or something
[20/02/18, 9:33:14 AM] Riddhima Chicago: But if I see overlap of career interests I make that as my main ask and leave talking about his current job(which is the main focus) for the conversation
[20/02/18, 9:33:44 AM] Sush: Ok
[20/02/18, 9:33:54 AM] Riddhima Chicago: Use the words career gudiance/advice/ wanna learn etc etc
[20/02/18, 9:34:03 AM] Sush: Acha okay
[20/02/18, 9:34:10 AM] Riddhima Chicago: Don't mention jobs anywhere in the first email
[20/02/18, 9:34:20 AM] Sush: Like I actually I’m not able to understand what this man’s department does

As a child, Jenny attempts to drown another child for fun, and as an adult, her cruel games take on a more calculating and sexual nature. She cozies up to guileless timber baron, Isaiah Poster (Gene Lockhart) intent on marrying the old codger, but when his son Ephraim (Louis Hayward) returns home from college, she reconfigures her scheme in a diabolical way._

[07/09/18, 11:08:15 AM] Sush: I like the closets in the 1125 better
[07/09/18, 11:08:23 AM] Riddhima Chicago: Okay
[07/09/18, 11:08:36 AM] Sush: and also the kitchen area is tiled - so it creates a better separation between kitchen and living room
[07/09/18, 11:09:09 AM] Sush: The closets have floor to ceiling mirrors 😍
[07/09/18, 11:09:17 AM] Sush: Imagine my selfie game 👻

[07/09/18, 11:09:59 AM] Sush: Not on the closet doors
[07/09/18, 11:10:42 AM] Riddhima Chicago: I haven't seen this apartment in person so don't get the exact feel. But this is what I liked and what I didn't: 1. Kitchen counters are better, 2. I, personally, don't like washing my hands outside the bathroom
[07/09/18, 11:10:56 AM] Sush: I agree with 2😂
[07/09/18, 11:11:22 AM] Sush: I had only thought of brushing my teeth lol

[07/09/18, 11:13:34 AM] Sush: and the closets and all were kind of flimsy looking
[07/09/18, 11:13:35 AM] Riddhima Chicago: Did you get the floor plan
[07/09/18, 11:13:41 AM] Sush: It was smaller than yours
[07/09/18, 11:13:48 AM] Sush: She said she’ll send I should check
[07/09/18, 11:13:58 AM] Sush: there wasn’t enough storage
[07/09/18, 11:13:58 AM] Riddhima Chicago: Ask for floor plan
[07/09/18, 11:14:07 AM] Sush: and like idk, there’s not much to do there

[14/12/18, 11:42:28 PM] Riddhima Chicago: I was thinking of working on nlp during the break

[14/12/18, 11:44:38 PM] Sush: dan jurafsky also
[14/12/18, 11:44:54 PM] Sush: his book is a bit more theoretical
[14/12/18, 11:45:05 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Hmm okay
[14/12/18, 11:45:17 PM] Sush: but very readable
[14/12/18, 11:45:24 PM] Sush: Speech and Natural Language Processing
[14/12/18, 11:45:28 PM] Riddhima Chicago: I was thinking of going along with the codes and then understanding the theory
[14/12/18, 11:45:39 PM] Riddhima Chicago: I lose interest soon otherwise lol
[14/12/18, 11:45:58 PM] Sush: then julia silge is the better option

[14/12/18, 11:46:16 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Hmm
[14/12/18, 11:46:24 PM] Riddhima Chicago: I see
[14/12/18, 11:46:31 PM] Sush: it's not a v applied book

[14/12/18, 11:47:45 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Lol
[14/12/18, 11:48:02 PM] Riddhima Chicago: I doubt my commitments on coursera too
[14/12/18, 11:48:08 PM] Riddhima Chicago: But I feel I will go with nlp
[14/12/18, 11:48:23 PM] Riddhima Chicago: At least the basics because I see the need
[14/12/18, 11:48:38 PM] Riddhima Chicago: And the fact that there is a possibility to actually use it somewhere
[14/12/18, 11:48:53 PM] Sush: NLP is v cool 😍😍

[14/12/18, 11:50:45 PM] Sush: no, that was Content Analysis
[14/12/18, 11:50:52 PM] Sush: i mean - it was applied NLP
[14/12/18, 11:50:53 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Ok
[14/12/18, 11:51:10 PM] Sush: that was a really nice class too but i dont ❤ the prof :P

[14/12/18, 11:55:10 PM] Sush: pick one randomly pls
[14/12/18, 11:55:13 PM] Sush: i want to do both
[14/12/18, 11:55:19 PM] Riddhima Chicago: What's this?
[14/12/18, 11:55:18 PM] Sush: close eyes and choose
[14/12/18, 11:55:36 PM] Sush: it's a book by hadley wickham on more advanced functional programming approaches in R
[14/12/18, 11:55:56 PM] Sush: like to better manipulate data structures, the environment, the stack, etc
[14/12/18, 11:56:22 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Hmm I think choose what's more of an immediate need/relevant to work
[14/12/18, 11:56:39 PM] Riddhima Chicago: I am leaning towards deep learning
[14/12/18, 11:56:39 PM] Sush: yeah the R book is more relevant now :/
[14/12/18, 11:56:41 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Though
[14/12/18, 11:56:46 PM] Sush: but deep learning sounds more fun lol

[20/12/18, 7:58:28 AM] Riddhima Chicago: i was wondering if there is a way to present something in summary for the users
[20/12/18, 7:58:35 AM] Riddhima Chicago: was reading about facebook
[20/12/18, 7:58:49 AM] Sush: manual summarisation only
[20/12/18, 7:58:58 AM] Riddhima Chicago: was thinking if only users read the terms and conditions properly
[20/12/18, 7:58:59 AM] Riddhima Chicago: hmm
[20/12/18, 7:59:01 AM] Riddhima Chicago: ok
[20/12/18, 7:59:12 AM] Sush: You’d want to use NLP if you’re summarising 1 million documents
[20/12/18, 7:59:44 AM] Riddhima Chicago: but imagine the scale if you have a model you can literally use it on any application
[20/12/18, 8:00:09 AM] Riddhima Chicago: can be million apps/documents
[20/12/18, 8:00:37 AM] Sush: it’s still a v v nascent field - and craaaazy difficult to do
[20/12/18, 8:00:46 AM] Riddhima Chicago: hmm I see
[20/12/18, 8:00:56 AM] Sush: like - imagine you have to preserve the semantics of the text
[20/12/18, 8:01:09 AM] Riddhima Chicago: get it
[20/12/18, 8:01:20 AM] Riddhima Chicago: got*
[20/12/18, 8:02:29 AM] Sush: Wikipedia uses some summarisation stuff

[20/12/18, 8:02:57 AM] Sush: One of the ways they do it is just select a subset of sentences
[20/12/18, 8:03:02 AM] Riddhima Chicago: from someone older to me

[28/12/18, 9:29:47 AM] Sush: I can’t help if my work isn’t brag worthy in her staff room
[28/12/18, 9:30:00 AM] Sush: Ya she’d rather I was pushing excel sheets at McKinsey
[28/12/18, 9:30:42 AM] Riddhima Chicago: Hmm let it be
[28/12/18, 9:30:48 AM] Riddhima Chicago: I know it's easier to say

[28/12/18, 9:31:15 AM] Riddhima Chicago: For saying that I should change myself because apparently I must be doing something vwrong
[28/12/18, 9:31:29 AM] Sush: in what regard?
[28/12/18, 9:31:34 AM] Riddhima Chicago: If two old men showed interest
[28/12/18, 9:31:43 AM] Riddhima Chicago: Because it's only happening with me
[28/12/18, 9:31:47 AM] Riddhima Chicago: So I am at fault
[28/12/18, 9:31:49 AM] Sush: Ugh that’s so stupid
[28/12/18, 9:31:52 AM] Riddhima Chicago: And I should change
[28/12/18, 9:31:56 AM] Riddhima Chicago: I know
[28/12/18, 9:32:02 AM] Sush: You did literally nothing wrong
[28/12/18, 9:32:05 AM] Riddhima Chicago: I think I am just hurt that he said so
[28/12/18, 9:32:14 AM] Sush: That’s very fair
[28/12/18, 9:32:26 AM] Sush: I don’t think they realise just how ubiquitous it is
[28/12/18, 9:32:39 AM] Sush: HOWEVER you behave
[28/12/18, 9:32:54 AM] Riddhima Chicago: Hmm I also feel it's not my first coffee with a man, others have behaved
[28/12/18, 9:33:04 AM] Riddhima Chicago: I met somebody on Monday before than guy
[28/12/18, 9:33:11 AM] Sush: You’re a young pretty girl and men will interpret ANY behaviour as interest if they want to
[28/12/18, 9:33:21 AM] Riddhima Chicago: He was helpful and nice and I bought him the coffee because I felt I asked him for the meeting
[28/12/18, 9:33:46 AM] Riddhima Chicago: I don't know if that again is an act of showing gratitude or interest in someone
[28/12/18, 9:34:17 AM] Riddhima Chicago: That guy was just nice about all this
[28/12/18, 9:34:21 AM] Riddhima Chicago: I don't know re
[28/12/18, 9:34:28 AM] Riddhima Chicago: I was hurt and I still am
[28/12/18, 9:34:57 AM] Sush: It’s convention also no - if you ask someone for gyaan, you get the coffee
[28/12/18, 9:35:35 AM] Riddhima Chicago: I don't know re I feel like the patriarchy makes men think they should always buy for themselves
[28/12/18, 9:35:46 AM] Riddhima Chicago: But I do know that man didn't read anything into it
[28/12/18, 9:36:04 AM] Riddhima Chicago: He just said are you sure and then I really really appreciate it
[28/12/18, 9:36:11 AM] Riddhima Chicago: And he was just plain simple helpful
[28/12/18, 9:36:28 AM] Sush: That’s a relief

[16/01/19, 7:41:07 AM] Sush: batao ji
[16/01/19, 7:41:28 AM] Riddhima Chicago: Stata doesn't run a regression if there is multicollinearity while R does
[16/01/19, 7:41:44 AM] Riddhima Chicago: any clue how R's regression function works
[16/01/19, 7:42:59 AM] Sush: I *think* R implicitly drops one of the variables
[16/01/19, 7:43:06 AM] Sush: I could be wrong - I’ll look up
[16/01/19, 7:43:15 AM] Riddhima Chicago: i think the same
[16/01/19, 7:43:31 AM] Sush: I remember encountering this
[16/01/19, 7:43:40 AM] Sush: Someone told me I should remember to check
[16/01/19, 7:43:24 AM] Riddhima Chicago: not sure myself
[16/01/19, 7:43:36 AM] Riddhima Chicago: was reg gender on treat and block
[16/01/19, 7:43:43 AM] Riddhima Chicago: where block and gender were collinear
[16/01/19, 7:44:04 AM] Riddhima Chicago: my p values from R were exactly same as regressing gender on only treat in stata
[16/01/19, 7:44:17 AM] Riddhima Chicago: stata was omitting it if i was running reg gender treat block
[16/01/19, 10:23:44 AM] Sush: that makes sense then
[16/01/19, 10:23:51 AM] Sush: R must be dropping
[17/01/19, 2:20:50 PM] Sush: Hi friend

[15/02/19, 1:46:07 PM] Riddhima Chicago: I put my codes in separate lines when they become obnoxiously long for me lol
[15/02/19, 1:46:17 PM] Sush: :D
[15/02/19, 1:46:19 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Just not in a habit of doing it regularly
[15/02/19, 1:46:29 PM] Sush: i really like this - https://style.tidyverse.org/
[15/02/19, 1:46:38 PM] Riddhima Chicago: But I agree it's more readable when you are doing multiple things
[15/02/19, 1:47:01 PM] Sush: in all our cs classes - we had to follow the rule of no more than 80 characters on one line
[15/02/19, 1:47:42 PM] Sush: because it's easier for eye to move in one direction or something
[15/02/19, 1:47:49 PM] Sush: like you're going linearly down
[15/02/19, 1:49:18 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Yeah makes sense

[15/02/19, 1:50:18 PM] Sush: correct
[15/02/19, 1:50:33 PM] Sush: this i just learned the hard way though :P
[15/02/19, 1:51:03 PM] Sush: a) by losing lots of marks in CS to bad style :( and b) by struggling to follow my own code later / read a collaborator's code
[15/02/19, 1:51:35 PM] Sush: i lost like 2% once because i didn't put spaces around my operators!
[15/02/19, 1:51:48 PM] Sush: like c=a+b as opposed to c = a + b
[15/02/19, 1:52:18 PM] Sush: one horrible habit i haven't corrected is having shitty variable names

[15/02/19, 2:07:19 PM] Riddhima Chicago: I think facets makes more sense than putting both treat/control on the same axis
[15/02/19, 2:07:21 PM] Sush: basically - young people get shot way more
[15/02/19, 2:07:25 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Thanks
[15/02/19, 2:07:32 PM] Sush: i agree - i do like facets a lot

[15/02/19, 2:11:50 PM] Riddhima Chicago: I am also struggling with my work which in comparision is way easier
[15/02/19, 2:12:00 PM] Sush: apparently it's really easy with some software called gephi - i *just* couldn't figure it out
[15/02/19, 2:12:33 PM] Sush: don't think that way! i took like 7-8 classes in CS - you took one! it's really impressive how much you're doing with it

[21/02/19, 5:57:56 PM] Sush: i always found the steve jobs copying lame haha
[21/02/19, 5:58:26 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Lol
[21/02/19, 5:58:26 PM] Sush: and like idk - i feel strongly that women can be great leaders without emulating male leaders
[21/02/19, 5:58:36 PM] Riddhima Chicago: That's true
[21/02/19, 5:58:44 PM] Sush: i also wonder tho
[21/02/19, 5:59:01 PM] Sush: that if people scrutinized her way more because she's a young woman
[21/02/19, 5:59:03 PM] Riddhima Chicago: But I think more than emulating male leaders it's also more about how many female leaders do you see in the first place
[21/02/19, 5:59:12 PM] Sush: maybe a man would have gotten away with it for longer
[21/02/19, 5:59:17 PM] Sush: true agree
[21/02/19, 5:59:31 PM] Riddhima Chicago: So I don't mind someone emulating someone irrespective of male/female
[21/02/19, 6:00:03 PM] Sush: i think that sucks because qualities that get coded as 'good' end up being 'masculine'
[21/02/19, 6:00:58 PM] Sush: what a phenomenal cover up though
[21/02/19, 6:01:05 PM] Sush: incredibly fascinating
[21/02/19, 6:03:08 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Yeah
[21/02/19, 6:03:27 PM] Sush: like not saying it's right or wrong - just personally don't connect with it
[21/02/19, 6:03:47 PM] Sush: not the fraud :P
[21/02/19, 6:03:50 PM] Riddhima Chicago: What's it?

[21/02/19, 6:04:01 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Lol okay
[21/02/19, 6:04:27 PM] Riddhima Chicago: I think finding someone as inspirational is different than the way she was copying
[21/02/19, 6:04:34 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Like dress code and all
[21/02/19, 6:04:44 PM] Sush: True
[21/02/19, 6:04:53 PM] Riddhima Chicago: And primarily focusing on poaching people from Apple lol

[21/02/19, 6:26:50 PM] Sush: I'm a data scientist at the Northwestern Neighbourhood and Network Initiative at Northwestern University. I study the ways in which crime spreads through spatial and social networks. I'm from Hyderabad, India and I currently live and work in Chicago.



My academic training is in Economics and Computational Social Science. I'm interested in the application of predictive analytics to crime and public health. I love reading, cooking,  all kinds of television, Indian music and flowers! 🌸

[21/02/19, 6:40:13 PM] Riddhima Chicago: I was asking him if it's possible to go for h1b and if it fails then go for j1
[21/02/19, 6:40:24 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Like if there is even such an option legally
[21/02/19, 6:40:42 PM] Sush: that sounds like a v fair question
[21/02/19, 6:40:53 PM] Riddhima Chicago: And he said something along the lines you should know you don't get to pick what visa we should apply for you

[08/03/19, 1:56:03 PM] Sush: awesome!
[08/03/19, 1:56:24 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Check it out, I use it in loops
[08/03/19, 1:56:40 PM] Sush: will do!
[08/03/19, 1:56:42 PM] Riddhima Chicago: For creating df while reading
[08/03/19, 1:56:46 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Multiple things
[08/03/19, 1:56:52 PM] Sush: i usually don't use loops in r
[08/03/19, 1:56:55 PM] Sush: oh that makes sense
[08/03/19, 1:57:13 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Interesting, why?
[08/03/19, 1:57:15 PM] Sush: i end up doing that sort of thing in python
[08/03/19, 1:57:31 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Accha I see
[08/03/19, 1:57:31 PM] Sush: loops in r are slow
[08/03/19, 1:57:40 PM] Sush: so i'll use map functions typically
[08/03/19, 1:57:43 PM] Riddhima Chicago: I think I should start python again
[08/03/19, 1:57:49 PM] Riddhima Chicago: I think I forgot most things
[08/03/19, 1:58:00 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Oh okay!
[08/03/19, 1:58:14 PM] Sush: i actually don't know the answer to this and i think junta like alex engler should talk about it more
[08/03/19, 1:58:23 PM] Sush: whether it makes sense to go deeeeeep in one language
[08/03/19, 1:58:31 PM] Sush: or be flexible and multi-lingual
[08/03/19, 1:58:38 PM] Sush: i can see pros and cons with both
[08/03/19, 1:59:34 PM] Sush: but of course, with quick operations, it totally makes sense to just use a loop
[08/03/19, 1:59:46 PM] Sush: gains are not significant with smaller datasets
[08/03/19, 2:03:54 PM] Riddhima Chicago: I haven't used map functions
[08/03/19, 2:03:59 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Just looking at it now
[08/03/19, 2:04:43 PM] Sush: this was my entertainment last night

[08/03/19, 2:06:18 PM] Sush: no text mining also - just looked at the description and checked for the name

[19/03/19, 11:20:03 AM] Sush: ugh
[19/03/19, 11:20:19 AM] Sush: that's infuriating, dost!
[19/03/19, 11:46:22 AM] Riddhima Chicago: Seemed like he had some mental health issue re

[19/03/19, 11:46:52 AM] Riddhima Chicago: Don't know appropriate reaction
[19/03/19, 11:47:14 AM] Riddhima Chicago: It's like uncomfort, fear, and little bit of empathy

[20/03/19, 12:24:03 PM] Sush: kaise ho aap?
[20/03/19, 12:24:39 PM] Riddhima Chicago: I am good
[20/03/19, 12:24:53 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Yaar I feel very conflicted about my feelings for swapnil
[20/03/19, 12:25:00 PM] Riddhima Chicago: I think that has been making me sad
[20/03/19, 12:25:13 PM] Riddhima Chicago: I don't know if it's temporary
[20/03/19, 12:25:18 PM] Sush: that's fair :(
[20/03/19, 12:25:32 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Or it's just build up
[20/03/19, 12:25:56 PM] Sush: you've been feeling this way a few weeks no?
[20/03/19, 12:26:00 PM] Riddhima Chicago: The idea of a world without him is also scary
[20/03/19, 12:26:07 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Yeah
[20/03/19, 12:26:56 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Anyway am I going on a cry baby trajectory while you had something to say
[20/03/19, 12:27:03 PM] Riddhima Chicago: 🙄
[20/03/19, 12:27:11 PM] Sush: no i just messaged to say hi ❤
[20/03/19, 12:27:47 PM] Sush: totally understandable dost - it's not a trivial decision for sure
[20/03/19, 12:28:10 PM] Sush: where does he stand?
[20/03/19, 12:29:46 PM] Riddhima Chicago: I don't know
[20/03/19, 12:31:31 PM] Riddhima Chicago: He says he loves me and want to be with me
[20/03/19, 12:31:39 PM] Riddhima Chicago: But we also fight
[20/03/19, 12:31:53 PM] Riddhima Chicago: We are not sure when we want to marry and if we want to marry
[20/03/19, 12:32:30 PM] Riddhima Chicago: I also feel he might be hesitant himself in accepting the truth to me or even to himself altogether
[20/03/19, 12:32:34 PM] Riddhima Chicago: 🙄
[20/03/19, 12:32:56 PM] Sush: yeah, that is entirely possible and quite understandable also
[20/03/19, 12:33:30 PM] Sush: why do you think you both have a reluctance to get married?
[20/03/19, 12:33:41 PM] Sush: like is it just logistics or something bigger?
[20/03/19, 12:33:57 PM] Riddhima Chicago: I think little bit of both
[20/03/19, 12:34:13 PM] Riddhima Chicago: I am also not sure if the distance is acting up now
[20/03/19, 12:34:42 PM] Riddhima Chicago: For instance sometime we fight because I don't get his humor or he doesn't get mine
[20/03/19, 12:36:20 PM] Sush: i'm sure distance exacerbates that also - a lot is lost in communication without facial expressions etc
[20/03/19, 12:37:02 PM] Sush: and you're both in transition phase also - which does put a lot of strain on relationships if you're both doing it at the same time no?
[20/03/19, 12:38:47 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Hmm
[20/03/19, 12:39:11 PM] Riddhima Chicago: I just want to cry 😋
[20/03/19, 12:39:17 PM] Sush: not to say these are not real issues - i think transition is a time that *highlights* issues
[20/03/19, 12:39:23 PM] Sush: ayy behen ❤
[20/03/19, 12:39:56 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Kya kere behen
[20/03/19, 12:41:18 PM] Sush: behen have you thought more about seeing a therapist
[20/03/19, 12:41:46 PM] Sush: might be helpful
[20/03/19, 12:41:48 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Yeah I think I should go
[20/03/19, 12:42:43 PM] Sush: i think it's a different type of support than close friends, but can be so empowering as well
[20/03/19, 12:43:07 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Yeah I will take it more seriously and go this time
[20/03/19, 12:43:28 PM] Sush: love you sis
[20/03/19, 12:45:48 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Love you too sis

[20/03/19, 12:47:00 PM] Riddhima Chicago: She needs to learn few social cues haha maybe she is teasing you but doesn't realize texting isn't the best place to do that

[27/03/19, 5:26:44 AM] Riddhima Chicago: but how would you go about it
[27/03/19, 5:26:45 AM] Riddhima Chicago: ?
[27/03/19, 9:46:10 AM] Sush: i usually start with looking at distributions for all variables individually, then time trends, then bivariate relationships

[27/03/19, 9:47:51 AM] Riddhima Chicago: I feel either 1. I am not looking at the right thing (and I don't know what else to look at lol) or 2. My methodology is wrong, in which case also I don't know what else to do lol
[27/03/19, 9:48:14 AM] Riddhima Chicago: Haan re, because there are so many possibilities with this random exploratory analysis lol

Why is it bad though, to tell someone you would not like to continue over a text? Isn't giving bad news in person all the more difficult when you are the cause?
[17/04/19, 8:59:07 AM] Riddhima Chicago: Was going to tweet it
[17/04/19, 8:59:30 AM] Riddhima Chicago: but decided otherwise

[06/05/19, 2:31:08 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Yaar I sometime get irritated by this research manager
[06/05/19, 2:31:19 PM] Sush: kaun?
[06/05/19, 2:31:22 PM] Riddhima Chicago: A part of me feels she is doing her job
[06/05/19, 2:31:26 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Mariah
[06/05/19, 2:31:34 PM] Sush: kya hua?
[06/05/19, 2:31:37 PM] Riddhima Chicago: So don't react
[06/05/19, 2:32:00 PM] Riddhima Chicago: We have to crunch some numbers for our partners
[06/05/19, 2:32:03 PM] Riddhima Chicago: As a report
[06/05/19, 2:32:15 PM] Riddhima Chicago: The whole report is #s, so I am doing that
[06/05/19, 2:32:21 PM] Sush: ok..
[06/05/19, 2:32:43 PM] Riddhima Chicago: I am not fully clear how these guys produced the report last time
[06/05/19, 2:33:05 PM] Riddhima Chicago: But what I have heard is it was little less systematic as the data was in hard copies
[06/05/19, 2:33:15 PM] Riddhima Chicago: And an intern entered it
[06/05/19, 2:33:30 PM] Riddhima Chicago: There are too much details here
[06/05/19, 2:33:40 PM] Sush: ok..
[06/05/19, 2:33:43 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Bottom line was since the data this time was in soft copy
[06/05/19, 2:33:54 PM] Riddhima Chicago: It was more systematic
[06/05/19, 2:34:15 PM] Riddhima Chicago: And she was like okay how did you did this
[06/05/19, 2:34:31 PM] Riddhima Chicago: And last time they were like reading through data and categorizing things
[06/05/19, 2:34:52 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Through some notes
[06/05/19, 2:34:58 PM] Sush: acha
[06/05/19, 2:35:02 PM] Sush: that sounds like ifmr lol
[06/05/19, 2:35:09 PM] Riddhima Chicago: In this data it's categorized in addition to those notes
[06/05/19, 2:35:22 PM] Riddhima Chicago: She is like oh it's different than what we did
[06/05/19, 2:35:32 PM] Riddhima Chicago: You mind looking into the notes columm too
[06/05/19, 2:35:37 PM] Riddhima Chicago: How much time will it take
[06/05/19, 2:35:48 PM] Riddhima Chicago: I was irritated at that
[06/05/19, 2:36:57 PM] Riddhima Chicago: A) there isn't much time, b) do text mining to replicate an unsystematic process
[06/05/19, 2:37:27 PM] Sush: look into the notes to make sure the categories are the same?
[06/05/19, 2:38:08 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Look into the notes to pick words that match those categories
[06/05/19, 2:39:02 PM] Sush: manually?
[06/05/19, 2:41:14 PM] Riddhima Chicago: I think these guys categorized it manually last time
[06/05/19, 2:41:30 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Which I believe is prone to error
[06/05/19, 2:41:45 PM] Riddhima Chicago: And the organization has itself categorized it
[06/05/19, 2:41:57 PM] Sush: ohhh
[06/05/19, 2:42:01 PM] Sush: so it's like double work?
[06/05/19, 2:42:09 PM] Sush: except the second version is less accurate?
[06/05/19, 2:42:26 PM] Sush: is she open to you disagreeing?
[06/05/19, 2:45:47 PM] Riddhima Chicago: I told her, it's going to take time if I were to do it
[06/05/19, 2:45:56 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Text mining is not my expertise
[06/05/19, 2:46:30 PM] Sush: are you just looking for the presence of some words?
[06/05/19, 2:46:44 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Haan re
[06/05/19, 2:46:43 PM] Sush: like if substring in string do this?
[06/05/19, 2:47:30 PM] Riddhima Chicago: I think yeah, you are right
[06/05/19, 2:47:41 PM] Riddhima Chicago: I was not thinking substring thing
[06/05/19, 2:47:45 PM] Riddhima Chicago: It will be easier
[06/05/19, 2:47:46 PM] Sush: in that case you might be able to do it quickly
[06/05/19, 2:47:54 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Yeah
[06/05/19, 2:47:57 PM] Sush: see grepl
[06/05/19, 2:48:03 PM] Riddhima Chicago: You are right
[06/05/19, 2:48:30 PM] Sush: or stringdetect in stringr
[06/05/19, 2:48:43 PM] Sush: *str_detect
[06/05/19, 2:49:13 PM] Sush: str_detect("sushmita, "sush") will return True

[06/05/19, 3:18:15 PM] Sush: such bad writing
[06/05/19, 3:18:47 PM] Sush: half the characters behaved in ways that felt completely unnatural and not true to themselves
[06/05/19, 3:19:09 PM] Sush: so much dumb shit also - FLYING DRAGONS couldn't see euron's ships?
[06/05/19, 3:19:27 PM] Sush: and how does euron see anything through all that kaajal lol
[06/05/19, 3:22:15 PM] Riddhima Chicago: I think that's possible, that's how some fighter fighters miss ground level missiles
[06/05/19, 3:23:31 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Lol
[06/05/19, 3:24:11 PM] Riddhima Chicago: I feel they twisted the character arch in last episode too

[07/05/19, 6:01:29 PM] Riddhima Chicago: I have been working long since last two weeks lol
[07/05/19, 6:01:36 PM] Riddhima Chicago: But I still think I cut corners

[07/05/19, 6:01:53 PM] Riddhima Chicago: I don't know

[07/05/19, 6:02:49 PM] Riddhima Chicago: I also don't want to keep doing analysis forever
[07/05/19, 6:02:53 PM] Sush: i get the frustration with figuring out what next but don't be too hard on yourself with this now - allow yourself to learn, we don't start off as experts
[07/05/19, 6:02:55 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Don't think it's my personality re
[07/05/19, 6:03:05 PM] Sush: that's fair
[07/05/19, 6:03:26 PM] Sush: is there scope for transition to something more managerial within the labs?
[07/05/19, 6:03:28 PM] Riddhima Chicago: And what frustrates me is not that I am not an expert, but that I don't want to bean expert in this
[07/05/19, 6:03:33 PM] Riddhima Chicago: And I am still doing this
[07/05/19, 6:03:45 PM] Sush: that's very fair, i hear you
[07/05/19, 6:03:46 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Not knowing what good will come out if it lol
[07/05/19, 6:04:03 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Maybe, but this rct manager work doesn't excite me
[07/05/19, 6:04:13 PM] Riddhima Chicago: I feel like ker toh liya ye sab
[07/05/19, 6:04:44 PM] Riddhima Chicago: I feel like you want to be in data science
[07/05/19, 6:04:51 PM] Sush: you think it'll be a good transition to what you want?
[07/05/19, 6:04:53 PM] Riddhima Chicago: At least you are on that path
[07/05/19, 6:05:03 PM] Riddhima Chicago: I haven't fully figure out mypath

[07/05/19, 6:05:55 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Sometimes I think it's just a location and not career growth
[07/05/19, 6:06:34 PM] Sush: do you want to think through some resources that can help you find that path?
[07/05/19, 6:07:02 PM] Sush: you're already doing step 1 i think - talking to different people about their paths
[07/05/19, 6:09:59 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Hmm

[22/05/19, 1:22:58 PM] Sush: so i'm trying not to get irritated

[22/05/19, 1:28:25 PM] Riddhima Chicago: What's the proposition?
[22/05/19, 1:28:59 PM] Riddhima Chicago: I am waiting for the weekend to finally see you
[22/05/19, 2:21:22 PM] Sush: do u want to become a member of chicago architecture association with me
[22/05/19, 2:24:43 PM] Riddhima Chicago: If it has $ then definitely no lol
[22/05/19, 2:24:52 PM] Riddhima Chicago: If it's free, then not sure
[22/05/19, 2:25:05 PM] Riddhima Chicago: What does it mean to be a member?
[22/05/19, 2:46:37 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Also I don't want to stay in academia
[22/05/19, 2:46:46 PM] Sush: yaar same
[22/05/19, 2:46:49 PM] Sush: let's bounce
[22/05/19, 2:46:54 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Or at a research organization like urban labs or something
[22/05/19, 2:46:55 PM] Sush: haha it is $$
[22/05/19, 2:47:12 PM] Riddhima Chicago: The only way to move up is PhD and I don't want one lol
[22/05/19, 2:47:51 PM] Sush: fair!
[22/05/19, 2:47:59 PM] Sush: bahut ho gaya
[22/05/19, 2:51:31 PM] Sush: it feels limiting after a point
[22/05/19, 2:51:36 PM] Sush: we keep talking only
[22/05/19, 4:37:56 PM] Riddhima Chicago: It took you 4 mints after your last text to realize it
[22/05/19, 4:42:21 PM] Riddhima Chicago: I am trying to learn the American culture
[22/05/19, 4:42:57 PM] Riddhima Chicago: In the office
[22/05/19, 5:30:45 PM] Sush: Means?
[22/05/19, 5:45:19 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Of owning mistakes, responding to people owning mistakes, responding to people than
[22/05/19, 5:45:23 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Bla bla
[22/05/19, 5:45:28 PM] Riddhima Chicago: I will tell you the story

[23/05/19, 2:29:33 PM] Sush: fuckall election, no?
[23/05/19, 2:29:40 PM] Sush: opposition has been a farce
[23/05/19, 2:31:28 PM] Riddhima Chicago: hehe yeah
[23/05/19, 2:32:01 PM] Riddhima Chicago: I am just like BJP again has more than 50% majority in Lok Sabha
[23/05/19, 2:32:00 PM] Sush: really incredible to see the nap also
[23/05/19, 2:32:05 PM] Sush: yeah!!
[23/05/19, 2:32:09 PM] Sush: *map
[23/05/19, 2:32:16 PM] Riddhima Chicago: coalition government no longer
[23/05/19, 2:32:21 PM] Sush: a lot of regional parties have managed to hold them at bay
[23/05/19, 2:32:31 PM] Sush: wherever congress was the other option, cleaan sweep lol
[23/05/19, 2:32:51 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Congress chuts
[23/05/19, 2:32:53 PM] Sush: i keep hoping ki pappu past ho gaya but no :P
[23/05/19, 3:08:14 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Lol
[23/05/19, 3:09:16 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Also I want to talk to you about a project
[23/05/19, 3:09:25 PM] Riddhima Chicago: And if it's worth pursuing for me
[23/05/19, 3:35:53 PM] Sush: ok i'm looking forward to hearing ❤
[23/05/19, 3:36:04 PM] Sush: i did a DUMB thing but it worked out well lol
[23/05/19, 3:37:01 PM] Riddhima Chicago: What dumb thing
[23/05/19, 3:37:03 PM] Riddhima Chicago: ?
[23/05/19, 3:37:11 PM] Sush: yaar i misread american dates
[23/05/19, 3:37:18 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Hahah
[23/05/19, 3:37:21 PM] Sush: i thought my visa was ending on july 8
[23/05/19, 3:37:24 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Valid  error
[23/05/19, 3:37:33 PM] Riddhima Chicago: It's August 8
[23/05/19, 3:37:36 PM] Sush: i need to get receipt from USCIS before that date
[23/05/19, 3:37:46 PM] Sush: so i was slightly panicked today and send my paperwork to uchicago
[23/05/19, 3:37:59 PM] Sush: but when i was sending they made me type in words
[23/05/19, 3:38:03 PM] Sush: and i realized August 7
[23/05/19, 3:38:12 PM] Sush: 7/8 vs 8/7 lol
[23/05/19, 3:38:23 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Haha
[23/05/19, 3:38:28 PM] Sush: phewwww
[23/05/19, 3:38:41 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Hehe
[23/05/19, 3:38:49 PM] Sush: glad it was not reverse confusion!!!
[23/05/19, 3:39:16 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Okay so this project will involve application development for databases in Ms access
[23/05/19, 3:39:23 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Yeah
[23/05/19, 3:39:33 PM] Sush: ohh this is at work itself?
[23/05/19, 3:39:41 PM] Sush: i somehow assumed side project
[23/05/19, 3:39:42 PM] Sush: go on
[23/05/19, 3:39:45 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Yeah
[23/05/19, 3:40:00 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Do you think it's a good skill/project to have it
[23/05/19, 3:40:01 PM] Riddhima Chicago: ?
[23/05/19, 3:40:09 PM] Riddhima Chicago: It's in 3 phases
[23/05/19, 3:40:21 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Redesign the current systen
[23/05/19, 3:40:39 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Will involve talking and understanding their need (I like that part somehow)
[23/05/19, 3:40:52 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Second will be rebuilding it in msacess
[23/05/19, 3:40:56 PM] Sush: to be honest, i really have no idea
[23/05/19, 3:41:04 PM] Riddhima Chicago: And last is reporting which is the usual stuff
[23/05/19, 3:41:08 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Lol
[23/05/19, 3:41:10 PM] Riddhima Chicago: What to do
[23/05/19, 3:41:13 PM] Riddhima Chicago: 😕
[23/05/19, 3:41:36 PM] Sush: if you won't be giving up something else you want, then doing a new thing is always a good thing
[23/05/19, 3:41:39 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Martin said it's a good project only if you secretly wanted to be a programmer
[23/05/19, 3:41:50 PM] Sush: ohh that makes sense
[23/05/19, 3:41:56 PM] Riddhima Chicago: It's just that it doesn't involve research
[23/05/19, 3:41:59 PM] Sush: i find databases to be kind of dull
[23/05/19, 3:42:09 PM] Sush: but they're EXTREEEMEEELLYYYYYYYY useful
[23/05/19, 3:42:21 PM] Riddhima Chicago: What do you mean?
[23/05/19, 3:42:31 PM] Sush: they can make a programmer's life much easier
[23/05/19, 3:42:42 PM] Riddhima Chicago: My inclination is because I am interested in understanding the government infrastructure around data
[23/05/19, 3:42:47 PM] Sush: question is do you want to design them or let the software folks do it
[23/05/19, 3:43:13 PM] Sush: do you know sql?
[23/05/19, 3:43:15 PM] Riddhima Chicago: My understanding is the software folks will be my work
[23/05/19, 3:43:41 PM] Riddhima Chicago: It's not going to be much in SQL, the govt office has a guy who is their sql guru and he has shown interest in it
[23/05/19, 3:43:43 PM] Sush: (actually i dont know if ms access uses sql - never used ms access)
[23/05/19, 3:43:54 PM] Sush: acha ok ok
[23/05/19, 3:43:56 PM] Riddhima Chicago: It's a different tool re
[23/05/19, 3:44:00 PM] Riddhima Chicago: I was reading about it
[23/05/19, 3:44:12 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Uses visual basic a bit from what I understand
[23/05/19, 3:44:17 PM] Sush: oh right
[23/05/19, 3:44:43 PM] Sush: does the 'translation' work sound interesting to you? that sounds up your allwy
[23/05/19, 3:44:45 PM] Sush: *alley
[23/05/19, 3:45:00 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Hmm
[23/05/19, 3:45:25 PM] Riddhima Chicago: These days I am constantly getting this feeling that I don't want to be the data guy
[23/05/19, 3:45:29 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Person*
[23/05/19, 3:45:32 PM] Riddhima Chicago: In the long run
[23/05/19, 3:45:53 PM] Riddhima Chicago: My body repels, feels like I am being restricted and pigeon holded
[23/05/19, 3:45:55 PM] Riddhima Chicago: 🙄🙄
[23/05/19, 3:45:59 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Too much confusion
[23/05/19, 3:46:05 PM] Sush: that's fair
[23/05/19, 3:46:10 PM] Riddhima Chicago: I will call in the evening and talk
[23/05/19, 3:46:20 PM] Sush: will this project get you out of the office and interacting with more people?
[23/05/19, 3:46:29 PM] Riddhima Chicago: I guess
[23/05/19, 3:46:29 PM] Riddhima Chicago: So
[23/05/19, 3:46:33 PM] Sush: or will you be sitting and writing code for the databases? (this is v boring)
[23/05/19, 3:46:51 PM] Riddhima Chicago: The redesign phase will require someone to understanding the business requirement
[23/05/19, 3:47:03 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Like what's working and what's not working for access front end
[23/05/19, 3:47:30 PM] Riddhima Chicago: And then building phase will be coding/programming (whatever the difference is, if there is) in Ms Access
[23/05/19, 3:47:43 PM] Sush: oh the first part sounds interesting
[23/05/19, 3:48:17 PM] Sush: and the second part ... since you're not looking to get depth with programming things, might be useful to know a little bit about another new thing - will expand your depth

[13/06/19, 1:26:47 PM] Sush: from june to sept - it's sort of a community thing - we all pick a DS goal to learn something and then work towards it over the summer
[13/06/19, 1:26:57 PM] Sush: you think i should start a local version at rladies chi?
[13/06/19, 1:27:12 PM] Sush: with like coffee check-ins every three weeks or so
[13/06/19, 1:27:48 PM] Sush: meet as a group, share what you learned
[13/06/19, 1:27:58 PM] Riddhima Chicago: I think it's a great idea

[13/06/19, 1:28:42 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Then get it voted from the community for each week/ 3 weeks
[13/06/19, 1:28:52 PM] Sush: can give a bunch of suggestions - people can pick something on it or choose something else
[13/06/19, 1:29:11 PM] Riddhima Chicago: That way I guess you can also build up resources for people to go to once a topic is picked
[13/06/19, 1:30:02 PM] Sush: i kinda dont want to do that because people are at suuuuch different levels
[13/06/19, 1:30:08 PM] Sush: both levels and verticals
[13/06/19, 1:30:24 PM] Sush: like DS in ecology looks totally different from DS in policy
[13/06/19, 1:30:37 PM] Sush: and even within each, some are beginners some are advanced
[13/06/19, 1:30:43 PM] Riddhima Chicago: True
[13/06/19, 1:31:06 PM] Riddhima Chicago: But I feel if the goal is for everyone to learn something new... People are more likely to start from a beginner level
[13/06/19, 1:31:08 PM] Riddhima Chicago: No?
[13/06/19, 1:31:09 PM] Sush: i was envisioning sort of a space for people to share, encourage each other, troubleshoot issues, help with challenges types
[13/06/19, 1:31:27 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Sometimes it's helpful to look at basic stuff to begin with
[13/06/19, 1:31:58 PM] Sush: like one of my goals is to learn to get my markdown files to seamlessly pull data from an AWS database and then to have a shiny app run off AWS EC2
[13/06/19, 1:32:04 PM] Riddhima Chicago: I was thinking of resources in addition to this
[13/06/19, 1:32:19 PM] Sush: and that's suuuuper specific
[13/06/19, 1:32:37 PM] Riddhima Chicago: This for in person meetings, but when people are working on their own they might have a handy list of online resources
[13/06/19, 1:32:47 PM] Sush: i like that - maybe we can build a common repository of resources we are using
[13/06/19, 1:32:48 PM] Riddhima Chicago: It's like you telling me start with x book for text mining
[13/06/19, 1:32:57 PM] Riddhima Chicago: And then we meet and do the trouble shoot
[13/06/19, 1:33:22 PM] Sush: true! can have a slack channel
[13/06/19, 1:33:30 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Hmm
[13/06/19, 1:33:32 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Yeah
[13/06/19, 1:33:56 PM] Riddhima Chicago: It's a great idea!
[13/06/19, 1:34:07 PM] Riddhima Chicago: I like it do pursue it in whatever format
[13/06/19, 1:34:10 PM] Riddhima Chicago: 👻👻
[13/06/19, 1:34:13 PM] Sush: i will try to implement! ❤ thank you frienddddd
[13/06/19, 1:34:19 PM] Riddhima Chicago: ❤❤❤
[13/06/19, 1:34:42 PM] Sush: wait you said data user meeting at urban labs

[13/06/19, 3:52:15 PM] Riddhima Chicago: While building algorithms
[13/06/19, 3:52:31 PM] Sush: forward variable selection? :P
[13/06/19, 3:52:52 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Is that stepwise regression ?
[13/06/19, 3:52:54 PM] Riddhima Chicago: I don't know
[13/06/19, 3:53:05 PM] Sush: haan you can use in stepwise regression
[13/06/19, 3:53:09 PM] Sush: also in ML algorithms
[13/06/19, 3:53:25 PM] Riddhima Chicago: What's the idea?
[13/06/19, 3:53:44 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Check model accuracy as we add new variables?
[13/06/19, 3:54:31 PM] Sush: ya basically - add a new variable if the addition of the variable reduces the mean squared error beyond a threshold
[13/06/19, 3:55:02 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Ok
[13/06/19, 4:08:26 PM] Sush: friend
[13/06/19, 4:08:33 PM] Sush: what if mainstream data science doesn't want me
[13/06/19, 4:10:05 PM] Riddhima Chicago: What's mainstream data science?
[13/06/19, 4:11:23 PM] Sush: like in tech
[13/06/19, 4:11:31 PM] Sush: and not policy / gov

[18/06/19, 10:24:57 PM] Riddhima Chicago: She just asked if I do
[18/06/19, 10:25:11 PM] Riddhima Chicago: My family doesn't drink so that's a big deal for them
[18/06/19, 10:25:29 PM] Sush: what did you say

[18/06/19, 10:25:54 PM] Riddhima Chicago: My mosi has no proof she just wants to gossip
[18/06/19, 10:26:00 PM] Sush: What a bitch
[18/06/19, 10:26:00 PM] Riddhima Chicago: My mom was okay after hearing my reply
[18/06/19, 10:26:03 PM] Sush: So unnecessary
[18/06/19, 10:26:07 PM] Sush: Leave your people alone
[18/06/19, 10:26:12 PM] Sush: *young
[18/06/19, 10:26:26 PM] Riddhima Chicago: It's like what's your business lady
[18/06/19, 10:26:34 PM] Sush: really!

[18/06/19, 10:26:40 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Your daughter will start drinking too

[19/06/19, 1:26:34 PM] Sush: hard questions
[19/06/19, 1:26:45 PM] Sush: but kept the work moving
[19/06/19, 1:29:07 PM] Sush: it's interesting to see the dynamic actually
[19/06/19, 1:29:43 PM] Sush: when we evaluated programs in india, the people implementing the program didn't hold the research team accountable *at all*, no?
[19/06/19, 1:30:36 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Accountable in what sense?
[19/06/19, 1:30:40 PM] Riddhima Chicago: But largely yes
[19/06/19, 1:30:43 PM] Riddhima Chicago: They didn't
[19/06/19, 1:30:55 PM] Sush: these guys had soooo many questions
[19/06/19, 1:31:17 PM] Sush: like if you're using x data, how will it reflect progress we have made along y dimension?
[19/06/19, 1:31:44 PM] Sush: for instance - using arrest / shooting data as primary outcome in a violence prevention program
[19/06/19, 1:32:40 PM] Sush: one man was like we work with a lot of young men - they haven't been arrested yet but they're in so much danger and if we keep them out of it it will just show 'no change' looking after before and after numbers
[19/06/19, 1:34:35 PM] Sush: they really pushed to ensure that the analysis was reflecting the full range of the work they were doing
[19/06/19, 1:34:48 PM] Riddhima Chicago: That's nice
[19/06/19, 1:35:02 PM] Sush: sometimes they dont get it and it is irritating
[19/06/19, 1:35:08 PM] Sush: but ultimately good i guess
[19/06/19, 2:04:35 PM] Sush: aap kaise ho?

[19/06/19, 3:02:39 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Collaborative project management software
[19/06/19, 3:02:52 PM] Sush: ohh ya we use one thing called Notion
[19/06/19, 3:02:56 PM] Sush: it's damn distracting
[19/06/19, 3:03:06 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Btw, there is a concept called population bottleneck, are you aware of it?
[19/06/19, 3:03:14 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Ohho
[19/06/19, 3:03:31 PM] Sush: like disaster?
[19/06/19, 3:03:59 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Related to genetics
[19/06/19, 3:04:13 PM] Sush: nahi
[19/06/19, 3:04:24 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Basically when one group doesnt mingles with groups of other genes
[19/06/19, 3:04:33 PM] Riddhima Chicago: India's caste system for instance
[19/06/19, 3:04:39 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Or Amish people
[19/06/19, 3:04:41 PM] Sush: ohhh
[19/06/19, 3:05:05 PM] Riddhima Chicago: So a group that intermingles within itself, while living with other groups
[19/06/19, 3:05:29 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Same Gene mingling leads to increased chances of certain diseases no
[19/06/19, 3:06:05 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Scientists have explored possibilities in a lot of such groups, but in case of India given the size of population
[19/06/19, 3:06:09 PM] Riddhima Chicago: No one has so far
[19/06/19, 3:06:13 PM] Riddhima Chicago: But there is potential
[19/06/19, 3:07:03 PM] Sush: makes sense
[19/06/19, 3:07:16 PM] Sush: there are some studies with parsis i think
[19/06/19, 3:07:22 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Hmm
[19/06/19, 3:07:34 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Kya Hume venture kerna chhaiye iss area mein 😂
[19/06/19, 3:07:53 PM] Sush: karo :P
[19/06/19, 3:08:08 PM] Sush: i'm sure there are some studies
[19/06/19, 3:09:02 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Apparently one jewish group setup an org to identify teens carrying certain mutation that causes a specific disease known to be very common in this Jewish group
[19/06/19, 3:09:46 PM] Riddhima Chicago: And so they then don't allow two people with this same mutation to marry
[19/06/19, 3:10:09 PM] Riddhima Chicago: I am forgetting the name of this Jewish subgroup, but they also follow the arranged marriage system
[19/06/19, 3:10:13 PM] Sush: ohhh
[19/06/19, 3:10:41 PM] Sush: gotra funda
[19/06/19, 3:10:52 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Anyway I am dumping what I was reading this morning lol

[19/06/19, 3:12:21 PM] Riddhima Chicago: It's amazing re how much what we see around us can also be inferred reading the genes data
[19/06/19, 3:13:22 PM] Sush: have you seen 23andme
[19/06/19, 3:13:38 PM] Riddhima Chicago: The gene testing thing?
[19/06/19, 3:13:54 PM] Sush: ya
[19/06/19, 3:14:13 PM] Riddhima Chicago: I have not
[19/06/19, 3:14:41 PM] Riddhima Chicago: I don't know if it's this 23andme, but for Indian gene pool
[19/06/19, 3:15:00 PM] Riddhima Chicago: It only tells it to be as South Asian
[19/06/19, 3:15:05 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Not more than that
[19/06/19, 3:15:16 PM] Sush: acha
[19/06/19, 3:15:18 PM] Riddhima Chicago: A part of it I think is political reasons too
[19/06/19, 3:15:23 PM] Sush: oh 100%
[19/06/19, 3:15:52 PM] Riddhima Chicago: But brahmins apparently have more eurasians Gene pool lol
[19/06/19, 3:16:05 PM] Sush: plus nationality is not the axis that separates gene pools in south asia
[19/06/19, 3:16:11 PM] Sush: it's caste and tribe ya
[19/06/19, 3:16:22 PM] Sush: and even that is contested
[19/06/19, 3:16:52 PM] Sush: omg dawna is being so intense
[19/06/19, 3:16:57 PM] Sush: she FLIES ABOUT
[19/06/19, 3:17:04 PM] Sush: always in state of emergency
[19/06/19, 3:17:08 PM] Sush: it's very annoying sometimes
[19/06/19, 3:17:15 PM] Riddhima Chicago: It's a combination of Iranian farmers + steppe + Andaman Islanders so far
[19/06/19, 3:17:21 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Kya hua?

[20/06/19, 10:42:17 AM] Sush: because they specifically know your data etc
[20/06/19, 10:42:33 AM] Sush: i think these community platforms are more for you to pick up new ideas / tools

[21/06/19, 12:15:53 PM] Sush: Hello R-Ladies!

Have you seen the Summer of Data Science #SoDS2019 project on Twitter? It was started by Renee Teate in 2017, as a way to use the summer to pick a specific learning goal, work towards it, share resources and inspire each other along the way.

We thought it would be fun and productive for us to follow along together, as a group! #SoDS2019 started in June, but since it isn’t actually summer yet in Chicago, #SoDSChi will start July 1 and end Sep 30. 

Here’s how to participate - 

Pick a specific, finite set of data science related things you want to learn about this summer 
Identify resources and create a plan to help you achieve your goals 
Share the plan on Twitter / the R-Ladies slack / wherever you’re comfortable with the hashtags #SoDSChi and #SoDS2019 
Come to monthly check-ins at R-Ladies where we will share progress, help each other with specific issues and celebrate our wins!
[21/06/19, 12:51:23 PM] Riddhima Chicago: 👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿

[21/06/19, 1:26:22 PM] Sush: what is the other feeling?
[21/06/19, 1:26:26 PM] Sush: fomo is quite natural no?
[21/06/19, 1:26:50 PM] Riddhima Chicago: I think more than fomo it's something else
[21/06/19, 1:27:10 PM] Riddhima Chicago: I think if I really saw some value I would have gone

[21/06/19, 1:34:05 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Ok
[21/06/19, 1:34:07 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Thanks lol
[21/06/19, 1:34:19 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Won't get into overthinking
[21/06/19, 1:34:28 PM] Riddhima Chicago: About bonding and stuff
[21/06/19, 1:34:29 PM] Riddhima Chicago: 😂😂
[21/06/19, 1:35:14 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Though I keep getting these thoughts if what I am presenting is useful things 😕
[21/06/19, 1:35:19 PM] Riddhima Chicago: So much overthink

[24/06/19, 8:34:56 AM] Riddhima Chicago: Dost I am having doubts about the presentation
[24/06/19, 8:35:06 AM] Riddhima Chicago: Don't know how useful will it be
[24/06/19, 8:35:12 AM] Riddhima Chicago: Like it's very basic and all
[24/06/19, 10:56:28 AM] Sush: it'll be great, friend!
[24/06/19, 10:56:48 AM] Riddhima Chicago: Quick question
[24/06/19, 10:56:48 AM] Sush: even if someone kinda knows how to do something it's ALWAYS useful to see someone talk about it
[24/06/19, 10:56:51 AM] Sush: say
[24/06/19, 10:57:00 AM] Riddhima Chicago: How do you save leaflet maps as png!
[24/06/19, 10:57:01 AM] Riddhima Chicago: ?
[24/06/19, 10:57:30 AM] Riddhima Chicago: Mapshot is not supported by the rstudio version I have
[24/06/19, 10:58:03 AM] Sush: take screenshot
[24/06/19, 10:58:50 AM] Riddhima Chicago: Hehe okay
[24/06/19, 10:58:59 AM] Sush: not sure if this uses mapshot - http://rowanwins.github.io/leaflet-easyPrint/
[24/06/19, 10:59:09 AM] Riddhima Chicago: Do you know what's a path variable?
[24/06/19, 10:59:28 AM] Riddhima Chicago: It seems like we can save it as html widget and then convert the html into png
[24/06/19, 10:59:37 AM] Riddhima Chicago: I am missing things in between
[24/06/19, 10:59:42 AM] Sush: filename <- 'presentations/images/map1.png'
[24/06/19, 10:59:44 AM] Sush: like that
[24/06/19, 10:59:56 AM] Sush: just a variable that defines a file path
[24/06/19, 11:01:48 AM] Riddhima Chicago: Figured it
[24/06/19, 11:02:25 AM] Riddhima Chicago: Htmlwidget and webshot
[24/06/19, 11:02:33 AM] Riddhima Chicago: Packages does the trick
[24/06/19, 11:48:35 AM] Sush: awesome!!
[24/06/19, 1:42:21 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Done with the presentation
[24/06/19, 2:47:11 PM] Sush: How was it?!
[24/06/19, 2:56:35 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Was okay I don't know
[24/06/19, 2:56:45 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Don't think people were using my code lol
[24/06/19, 4:05:41 PM] Sush: using your code for what?
[24/06/19, 4:05:45 PM] Sush: what did martin uncle say
[24/06/19, 4:08:43 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Thank you he said
[24/06/19, 4:08:47 PM] Riddhima Chicago: 😂
[24/06/19, 4:09:25 PM] Riddhima Chicago: During the presentation re to follow while I talked
[25/06/19, 9:57:03 AM] Riddhima Chicago: Want summer clothes
[25/06/19, 9:57:05 AM] Riddhima Chicago: 🙄🙄
[25/06/19, 9:57:10 AM] Sush: Hi behen
[25/06/19, 9:57:11 AM] Riddhima Chicago: Also better bras
[25/06/19, 9:57:14 AM] Sush: 😂
[25/06/19, 9:57:39 AM] Riddhima Chicago: I feel like my boobs are not holding properly, jumping all the time 🙄🙄
[25/06/19, 9:57:50 AM] Sush: Then time for new bras
[25/06/19, 9:58:04 AM] Riddhima Chicago: Also, divyasha was telling me about naked bike ride conversation with Maris at the party
[25/06/19, 9:58:07 AM] Riddhima Chicago: 😂😂
[25/06/19, 9:58:11 AM] Riddhima Chicago: What was that
[25/06/19, 9:58:12 AM] Sush: 😂😂😂
[25/06/19, 9:58:21 AM] Riddhima Chicago: You didn't tell me
[25/06/19, 9:58:22 AM] Sush: I was like lol white people
[25/06/19, 9:58:30 AM] Sush: And Maris said oh I did it
[25/06/19, 9:59:54 AM] Riddhima Chicago: Hehe
[25/06/19, 10:00:03 AM] Riddhima Chicago: Where was I when this conversation was happening
[25/06/19, 10:00:23 AM] Riddhima Chicago: I bought a new one, I still feel they are jumping
[25/06/19, 10:00:39 AM] Sush: Maybe you need tighter bras!
[25/06/19, 10:00:47 AM] Sush: Try shortening the straps
[25/06/19, 10:00:58 AM] Sush: Idk 😂
[25/06/19, 10:01:20 AM] Riddhima Chicago: Ok behen I will follow the advice haha
[25/06/19, 10:01:30 AM] Sush: 👻👻
[25/06/19, 10:01:45 AM] Riddhima Chicago: We go cheap summer shopping soon?
[25/06/19, 10:02:14 AM] Sush: We’ll go
[25/06/19, 10:02:21 AM] Sush: come to r ladies tomorrowwww
[25/06/19, 10:02:37 AM] Sush: Yaar I’ve not prepared for my Friday talk at all
[25/06/19, 10:07:26 AM] Riddhima Chicago: Machine learning one?
[25/06/19, 10:07:35 AM] Sush: Ya re
[25/06/19, 10:07:38 AM] Sush: It’s a long talk
[25/06/19, 10:07:41 AM] Riddhima Chicago: I also finally prepared yesterday morning at 4
[25/06/19, 10:07:48 AM] Sush: And to a bunch of very smart PhDs
[25/06/19, 10:07:54 AM] Sush: PhD students
[25/06/19, 10:07:58 AM] Riddhima Chicago: Hmm
[25/06/19, 10:08:03 AM] Sush: It’s very hard to form a narrative!
[25/06/19, 10:08:21 AM] Sush: Struggling to figure out what the right story to tell is
[25/06/19, 10:08:35 AM] Sush: And striking the balance between substantive and too technical
[25/06/19, 10:08:40 AM] Riddhima Chicago: Hmm
[25/06/19, 10:09:10 AM] Sush: Machine learning is hard to explain!
[25/06/19, 10:09:11 AM] Riddhima Chicago: I think either 1) you pick something you have already done before like in class or previous talk
[25/06/19, 10:09:25 AM] Riddhima Chicago: I think keep it very basic re
[25/06/19, 10:09:38 AM] Sush: No they want an introduction to machine learning to computational social science junta
[25/06/19, 10:09:44 AM] Sush: So I can’t recycle
[25/06/19, 10:09:47 AM] Riddhima Chicago: Like that Titanic data is I think good for introducing people with different steps in ML
[25/06/19, 10:10:06 AM] Sush: I want something more high level I think
[25/06/19, 10:10:12 AM] Riddhima Chicago: Also check if you could find any interesting data on kaggle
[25/06/19, 10:10:16 AM] Sush: High level as in abstracted
[25/06/19, 10:10:18 AM] Riddhima Chicago: Or a problem
[25/06/19, 10:10:34 AM] Sush: Don’t want it to be about using a dataset but about answering questions
[25/06/19, 10:10:55 AM] Sush: Maybe I’ll tweet and ask for examples 👻
[25/06/19, 10:11:12 AM] Sush: Interesting applications of ML used in soc sci
[25/06/19, 10:11:44 AM] Sush: For a lot of researchers I think the question is like ok I understand how to implement it but why should I do it? When should I do it?
[25/06/19, 10:12:00 AM] Riddhima Chicago: I see
[25/06/19, 10:12:05 AM] Sush: I’m still figuring out the answer 😂😂
[25/06/19, 10:12:11 AM] Riddhima Chicago: I don't think I understand this audience now
[25/06/19, 10:12:25 AM] Sush: They’re all phd students
[25/06/19, 10:12:27 AM] Riddhima Chicago: Do they have any introduction to ML methods?
[25/06/19, 10:12:28 AM] Sush: In soc sci
[25/06/19, 10:12:43 AM] Sush: Who want to explore how to use computational methods in their research
[25/06/19, 10:12:50 AM] Riddhima Chicago: Hmm
[25/06/19, 10:13:20 AM] Sush: I kinda want it to be like econometrics can do a, b, c
[25/06/19, 10:13:30 AM] Sush: But ML can help with d, e
[25/06/19, 10:13:51 AM] Riddhima Chicago: My only worry with coming up with a new question is then you will be running model and showing them what that model says which I am not sure in short turnaround would be tested well to say so x model shows the answer to question Y is this
[25/06/19, 10:13:51 AM] Sush: Econometrics / causal inference
[25/06/19, 10:14:28 AM] Sush: I won’t come up with a question - it’s not going to be a coding thing. It’ll be conceptual
[25/06/19, 10:14:36 AM] Sush: No demo of a model at all
[25/06/19, 10:14:56 AM] Riddhima Chicago: If I were you, I will show them a basic example to introduce methods in ML, and then show some examples where ML was used to get answer like previous studies
[25/06/19, 10:14:58 AM] Sush: I’ll talk about my thesis to show an application
[25/06/19, 10:15:11 AM] Riddhima Chicago: Cool, that makes sense
[25/06/19, 10:15:16 AM] Sush: Haan
[25/06/19, 10:15:30 AM] Riddhima Chicago: Check that woman's work Rhema
[25/06/19, 10:15:34 AM] Sush: Yeah I’ll def talk about some cool studies
[25/06/19, 10:15:59 AM] Riddhima Chicago: She has done a lot predictive analytical work for for various government
[25/06/19, 10:16:06 AM] Riddhima Chicago: Like predicted at risk kids

[25/06/19, 10:19:21 AM] Riddhima Chicago: Some other examples
[25/06/19, 10:19:34 AM] Riddhima Chicago: The Standford professor I forgot her name
[25/06/19, 10:19:42 AM] Sush: Thanks friend!!
[25/06/19, 10:19:47 AM] Sush: Susan athey?
[25/06/19, 10:19:52 AM] Sush: Raj chetty?
[25/06/19, 10:19:59 AM] Riddhima Chicago: Even sendhill does a lot of ML work
[25/06/19, 10:20:02 AM] Riddhima Chicago: This
[25/06/19, 10:20:10 AM] Sush: Ya I saw one Sendhil talk last night
[25/06/19, 10:20:15 AM] Sush: He’s so annoying Lolol
[25/06/19, 10:20:24 AM] Riddhima Chicago: I love him 😬
[25/06/19, 10:20:32 AM] Sush: I love reading him
[25/06/19, 10:20:42 AM] Sush: But watching him talk 😂😂
[25/06/19, 10:20:42 AM] Riddhima Chicago: Hehe
‎[25/06/19, 10:21:14 AM] Sush: ‎GIF omitted
[25/06/19, 10:21:52 AM] Riddhima Chicago: Haha I adore him lol
[25/06/19, 10:22:15 AM] Sush: He’s brilliant for sure!
[25/06/19, 10:22:15 AM] Riddhima Chicago: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/computational-social-science/
[25/06/19, 10:22:39 AM] Sush: One of them spoke last week!
[25/06/19, 10:22:43 AM] Riddhima Chicago: I heard some of their researchers present their work at uchicago
[25/06/19, 10:22:45 AM] Sush: From Microsoft research
[25/06/19, 10:22:49 AM] Riddhima Chicago: Don't remember all
[25/06/19, 10:22:58 AM] Sush: I remember David Rothschild
[25/06/19, 10:22:59 AM] Riddhima Chicago: But some of it was interesting
[25/06/19, 10:23:20 AM] Sush: Hannah Wallach I saw her scipy conf talk v cool
[25/06/19, 10:23:52 AM] Riddhima Chicago: Hmm did you think of applying here?
[25/06/19, 10:24:17 AM] Sush: I did - all their openings at that time required a PhD
[25/06/19, 10:24:33 AM] Sush: I think 80-90% of the group has a PhD
[25/06/19, 10:24:43 AM] Riddhima Chicago: Amit Sharma I remember presented at uchicago
[25/06/19, 10:24:55 AM] Riddhima Chicago: One other white guy (who was v v cute) lol
[25/06/19, 10:24:57 AM] Sush: A lot of their work goes into theoretical aspects am
[25/06/19, 10:24:59 AM] Sush: Ohhh
[25/06/19, 10:25:33 AM] Sush: I struggle a bit with this
[25/06/19, 10:25:40 AM] Sush: I can work hard and understand it
[25/06/19, 10:25:51 AM] Sush: Not sure if I can make contributions to it
[25/06/19, 10:26:16 AM] Riddhima Chicago: Hmm makes sense
[25/06/19, 10:26:31 AM] Riddhima Chicago: I find it difficult to grasp theoretical aspect too
[25/06/19, 10:26:36 AM] Sush: But so much respect for people who can
[25/06/19, 10:26:42 AM] Riddhima Chicago: Like I can understand it, but it doesn't come naturally
[25/06/19, 10:26:49 AM] Sush: Yaaa same
[25/06/19, 10:26:50 AM] Riddhima Chicago: Need to work hard to understand it basically
[25/06/19, 10:27:04 AM] Sush: Even math
[25/06/19, 10:27:04 AM] Riddhima Chicago: Like this rachit does theory
[25/06/19, 10:27:11 AM] Sush: I’m good enough at it to use it as a tool
[25/06/19, 10:27:18 AM] Sush: But I don’t understand deeply
[25/06/19, 10:27:34 AM] Sush: 🙏🏽
[25/06/19, 10:27:42 AM] Riddhima Chicago: Haha yeah
[25/06/19, 5:01:29 PM] Sush: siiis
‎[25/06/19, 5:01:41 PM] Sush: ‎image omitted
[25/06/19, 5:03:29 PM] Riddhima Chicago: What's traditional programming?
[25/06/19, 5:03:55 PM] Sush: any programming
[25/06/19, 5:04:02 PM] Riddhima Chicago: I think rules is not the right word
[25/06/19, 5:04:06 PM] Sush: idea is you take an input, perform a set of operations on it and get an output
[25/06/19, 5:04:15 PM] Riddhima Chicago: More like factors contributing to output
[25/06/19, 5:04:24 PM] Sush: a lot of ML literature uses the word rules
[25/06/19, 5:04:29 PM] Sush: so this speaks to that
[25/06/19, 5:04:30 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Okay
[25/06/19, 5:04:38 PM] Sush: 'decision rules'
[25/06/19, 5:04:49 PM] Sush: i liked this little infographic so much
[25/06/19, 5:04:54 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Yeah that sounds better
[25/06/19, 5:05:26 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Only reason I am asking about programming is I don't know if social scientist use that word
[25/06/19, 5:09:16 PM] Sush: Good point
[25/06/19, 5:51:59 PM] Sush: Sendhil on Ezra Klein this week haha
[25/06/19, 5:52:03 PM] Sush: Two of your favs
[25/06/19, 6:28:02 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Hahah

[25/06/19, 6:28:11 PM] Riddhima Chicago: I am meeting Joseph right now
[25/06/19, 6:28:19 PM] Riddhima Chicago: He is saying he thinks darshan is gay
[25/06/19, 6:28:21 PM] Riddhima Chicago: 😂😂
[26/06/19, 7:28:44 AM] Riddhima Chicago: Just saw this on his podcast lol

[26/06/19, 10:49:00 AM] Sush: say
[26/06/19, 1:49:39 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Got irritated with something in the morning
[26/06/19, 1:49:55 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Was thinking if that made me a bad person
[26/06/19, 1:50:18 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Will tell you in the evening
[26/06/19, 2:19:49 PM] Sush: tell me at R Ladies!
[26/06/19, 2:38:44 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Dost okay if I don't come? Will you be mad at me?
[26/06/19, 2:38:54 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Planning to go to yoga

[26/06/19, 2:45:23 PM] Riddhima Chicago: I will come
[26/06/19, 2:45:34 PM] Sush: i'm not going to be *doing* anything anyway
[26/06/19, 2:45:39 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Ok
[26/06/19, 2:45:51 PM] Sush: hahaha no go to yoga i was simply trolling
[26/06/19, 2:45:54 PM] Riddhima Chicago: I don't feel excited abouy analyzing the data lol
[26/06/19, 2:46:16 PM] Riddhima Chicago: How's work going?
[26/06/19, 2:46:21 PM] Riddhima Chicago: And how are you doing?
[26/06/19, 4:38:39 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Yaar
[26/06/19, 4:38:53 PM] Riddhima Chicago: I am just getting irritated with my cousin's visit for some.reason

[07/07/19, 1:20:26 PM] Riddhima Chicago: You don't drive and you don't have a car

[07/07/19, 1:21:29 PM] Sush: so it never occurred to me
[07/07/19, 1:21:37 PM] Sush: hahaha
[07/07/19, 1:21:51 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Who? The guy you didn't like? And they towed on 4th July , so 3rd July night it was fine I guess

[07/07/19, 1:30:27 PM] Riddhima Chicago: So my cousin called just now
[07/07/19, 1:30:47 PM] Riddhima Chicago: One can question the towing ticket apparently
[07/07/19, 1:31:29 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Would you mind checking two things 1. If there is anything in your lease about visitor parking, and 2) if you have any way of knowing if the parking area 11 is allocated to someone in the building?
[07/07/19, 1:32:18 PM] Riddhima Chicago: He was saying  if there is something about visitor parking and the 11th parking lot wasn't allocated to someone then he can question it that it was illegal to tow
[07/07/19, 1:32:26 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Just check when you have the time
[07/07/19, 1:33:11 PM] Sush: i will look
[07/07/19, 1:33:22 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Cool
[08/07/19, 12:42:43 PM] Sush: I called that guy - he says that spot was allocated
[08/07/19, 12:42:55 PM] Sush: That guy = Gabriel
[08/07/19, 12:43:01 PM] Sush: 😭
[08/07/19, 12:44:17 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Who is Gabriel ?
[08/07/19, 12:44:28 PM] Sush: Property manager
[08/07/19, 12:44:32 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Ohho
[08/07/19, 12:44:34 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Okay
[08/07/19, 12:44:46 PM] Sush: He’s the worst 🤬
[08/07/19, 12:44:53 PM] Riddhima Chicago: And is there anything about visitor parking in the lease
[08/07/19, 12:45:03 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Is he the same guy who called you on Saturday?
[08/07/19, 12:45:09 PM] Sush: I skimmed it and there isn’t
[08/07/19, 12:45:12 PM] Sush: Yeah
[08/07/19, 12:45:53 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Oh, he knew about the incident because we talked to him
[08/07/19, 12:46:20 PM] Sush: how did you find him?
[08/07/19, 12:47:26 PM] Riddhima Chicago: He was standing there
[08/07/19, 12:47:34 PM] Riddhima Chicago: He only told where the car was
[08/07/19, 12:47:37 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Horrible guy
[08/07/19, 12:47:39 PM] Sush: oh okay
[08/07/19, 12:47:43 PM] Sush: yeah he was quite rude today also
[08/07/19, 12:50:46 PM] Sush: so smug and condescending
[08/07/19, 12:51:03 PM] Sush: it's difficult to stop thinking about smacking him in the face
[08/07/19, 12:51:34 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Yaar I feel bad like was responsible for all this mess
[08/07/19, 12:51:53 PM] Riddhima Chicago: I offered to pay and they were like we can't take money from you, you are younger
[08/07/19, 12:52:00 PM] Riddhima Chicago: I don't know what else to do
[08/07/19, 12:52:06 PM] Sush: can i chip in?
[08/07/19, 12:52:18 PM] Riddhima Chicago: No you don't have to
[08/07/19, 12:52:33 PM] Riddhima Chicago: My relative , was my responsibility
[08/07/19, 12:52:40 PM] Riddhima Chicago: I offered they didn't take it
[08/07/19, 12:52:56 PM] Sush: it was my dumb idea tho
[08/07/19, 12:53:11 PM] Sush: really didn't even occur to me - just thought it would be convenient :/
[08/07/19, 12:53:30 PM] Riddhima Chicago: It's fine re, intentions were right
[08/07/19, 12:53:40 PM] Sush: did they seem very upset?
[08/07/19, 12:53:53 PM] Riddhima Chicago: I think a little bit
[08/07/19, 12:54:43 PM] Riddhima Chicago: I just feel like they wanted to avoid paid parking which honestly would have been cheaper than this, and my cousin was forcing me to get that visitor pass for Cook county
[08/07/19, 12:55:25 PM] Riddhima Chicago: I just feel I should have said, it's not convenient for me to get the visitor pass during workday, we can either pay or go to the cook county office when you come
[08/07/19, 12:56:19 PM] Sush: true - these things are so unfamiliar to us also
[08/07/19, 12:57:16 PM] Sush: internet says this won't affect auto insurance at all so that's one silver lining
[08/07/19, 12:57:32 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Hehe hmm
[08/07/19, 3:37:10 PM] Sush: is it legit to say i can't come to a meeting because of world cup? :/

[08/07/19, 4:08:42 PM] Riddhima Chicago: You can work from home and be in the meeting through a call?
[08/07/19, 4:08:47 PM] Riddhima Chicago: Say personal emergency
[08/07/19, 4:09:13 PM] Sush: ya i think i will say i'm sick
[08/07/19, 4:09:22 PM] Sush: diarrhea
