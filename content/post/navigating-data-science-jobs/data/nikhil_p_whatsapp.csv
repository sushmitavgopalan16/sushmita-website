3,"29/11/17, 3:03:58 PM",Sush, Hahahaha
4,"29/11/17, 3:04:11 PM",Sush, I really don't know it reminded me of you so strongly
5,"29/11/17, 3:04:38 PM",Nikhil, For some reason I just went to WhatsApp and realized none of my messages were getting pushed
6,"29/11/17, 3:04:44 PM",Nikhil, I have like 16 unread chats
7,"29/11/17, 3:05:00 PM",Nikhil, What are you up to?
8,"29/11/17, 3:05:00 PM",Sush, Ayy so popular

11,"29/11/17, 3:05:16 PM",Nikhil, Most are work chat groups ‚òπÔ∏è
12,"29/11/17, 3:05:27 PM",Sush, So they're all chilling or have left
13,"29/11/17, 3:05:46 PM",Sush, I'm in an inordinately good mood given how much work I have this week!
14,"29/11/17, 3:06:25 PM",Nikhil," Me too! But that‚Äôs also because I just had a bottle of wine, almost"
15,"29/11/17, 3:06:41 PM",Nikhil, And am finally getting a little bit of relaxation
16,"29/11/17, 3:07:39 PM",Nikhil, What kind of lab is this?
17,"29/11/17, 3:10:58 PM",Sush, Haha that's nice!
18,"29/11/17, 3:11:11 PM",Sush, This is for the computing for social science class I TA
19,"29/11/17, 3:11:32 PM",Sush, They just work on their assignments and ask questions if they have any
20,"29/11/17, 3:11:55 PM",Sush, I'm 100% wanting this one dude in class to ask me out after my last office hours lol
21,"29/11/17, 3:12:12 PM",Sush, Are you still in India?
22,"29/11/17, 3:15:46 PM",Nikhil," No, went to Riyadh on Sunday and just got back to dubai a few hours back"
23,"29/11/17, 3:15:56 PM",Nikhil, Same dude you mentioned?
24,"29/11/17, 3:16:15 PM",Sush," Ah okay! For work, I imagine?"
25,"29/11/17, 3:16:17 PM",Sush, Haha yeah
26,"29/11/17, 3:16:49 PM",Sush, I'm dying in my machine learning class but it is SO cool
27,"29/11/17, 3:29:54 PM",Nikhil," Yep, all work"
28,"29/11/17, 3:30:03 PM",Nikhil, Lol
29,"29/11/17, 4:15:34 PM",Sush, Omg my students said such nice thingsssss
30,"29/11/17, 4:16:01 PM",Sush, AND my adviser said mine was one of the theses he's not worried about at all!
31,"29/11/17, 4:16:25 PM",Sush, I am not failing at life today üôåüèæüôåüèæüôåüèæ
32,"29/11/17, 11:30:57 PM",Nikhil, Hahaha
33,"29/11/17, 11:55:16 PM",Sush, Need to celebrate the little victories üòÇ
34,"29/11/17, 11:56:21 PM",Sush, Which I did by turning in my assignment with 30 minutes to spare
35,"29/11/17, 11:56:36 PM",Sush, As opposed to 30 secs last time
36,"30/11/17, 12:06:45 AM",Nikhil," Hey, 30 mins is plenty of buffer"
37,"30/11/17, 12:07:02 AM",Nikhil, You‚Äôre not optimizing if you‚Äôve got more time to spare üòÅ
38,"30/11/17, 12:07:33 AM",Nikhil," I‚Äôm on my way to Abu Dhabi for a day long PS, which is McKinsey speak for ‚Äúproblem solving session‚Äù"
39,"30/11/17, 12:07:44 AM",Nikhil, It‚Äôs going to be LONG
40,"30/11/17, 12:08:23 AM",Sush, Oh yeah I'm genuinely pleased about that - no sarcasm
41,"30/11/17, 12:08:41 AM",Sush, Lol will it be about a specific case?
42,"30/11/17, 12:08:51 AM",Sush, Also I'm applying next week! To McKinsey
43,"30/11/17, 12:08:55 AM",Sush, Data science
44,"30/11/17, 12:09:15 AM",Sush, Will send you my application after finals???
45,"30/11/17, 12:09:16 AM",Nikhil, It‚Äôs SUPPOSED to be about a specific case
46,"30/11/17, 12:09:47 AM",Nikhil, In this instance we are redefining everything a ministry should do over the next year
47,"30/11/17, 12:09:52 AM",Sush, Oh wow
48,"30/11/17, 12:09:55 AM",Nikhil, So it‚Äôs a lot of shit
49,"30/11/17, 12:10:16 AM",Sush, I thought that sounded really cool and powerful!
50,"30/11/17, 12:10:27 AM",Nikhil, Haha
51,"30/11/17, 12:10:32 AM",Nikhil, It does sound fancy
52,"30/11/17, 12:10:38 AM",Nikhil," In practice, mostly just tedious"
53,"30/11/17, 12:10:54 AM",Nikhil, And bureaucratic
54,"30/11/17, 12:12:31 AM",Sush, I'm sad that _policy_ junta don't get to do this
55,"30/11/17, 12:15:14 AM",Sush, Not that you guys wouldn't do a _good_ job of it but that policy people don't get these opportunities
56,"30/11/17, 12:37:49 AM",Nikhil, I mean
57,"30/11/17, 12:38:03 AM",Nikhil," We hire a lot of what you call policy junta, I think?"
58,"30/11/17, 12:38:13 AM",Nikhil, Or is this a more precisely defined group?
59,"30/11/17, 12:06:27 PM",Sush, I guess I mean policy think tanks
60,"30/11/17, 1:57:32 PM",Nikhil, Ah
61,"30/11/17, 1:57:54 PM",Nikhil," I think we work on narrower scopes than they do, actually"
62,"30/11/17, 1:58:17 PM",Nikhil, The work tends to be somewhat more inclined to the pragmatic
63,"30/11/17, 1:58:37 PM",Nikhil, Although it typically doesn‚Äôt feel that way
64,"30/11/17, 8:23:06 PM",Sush, Hmm okay!
65,"07/12/17, 2:58:22 AM",Sush, Hiii
66,"07/12/17, 2:58:31 AM",Sush, I'm in your neighbourhood
67,"07/12/17, 2:58:37 AM",Sush, Abu Dhabi
68,"07/12/17, 3:01:28 AM",Sush, Called by accident!!
69,"07/12/17, 3:01:30 AM",Nikhil, Hey!
70,"07/12/17, 3:01:35 AM",Nikhil," Yeah, I was wondering"
71,"07/12/17, 3:01:54 AM",Sush, Ya i didn't realise it was calling
72,"07/12/17, 3:02:00 AM",Nikhil, We‚Äôre just about to kick off our big presentation that we‚Äôve been working on with 50 different presenters
73,"07/12/17, 3:02:14 AM",Sush, Oooh good luck!!!
74,"07/12/17, 3:02:19 AM",Nikhil, To the minister and all the provincial governors here
75,"07/12/17, 3:02:26 AM",Sush, Very cool!
76,"07/12/17, 3:03:40 AM",Sush, I'm on my way hooome
77,"07/12/17, 3:03:45 AM",Sush, Will you be presenting?
78,"07/12/17, 3:21:47 AM",Nikhil," Oh no, the people we were working with will"
79,"10/12/17, 2:44:14 PM",Sush, Hii
80,"10/12/17, 2:54:47 PM",Sush, I need a book recommendation!!
81,"10/12/17, 11:01:57 PM",Nikhil, What kind?
82,"10/12/17, 11:19:09 PM",Sush, Fiction!
83,"10/12/17, 11:19:22 PM",Sush, I have holidays
84,"10/12/17, 11:19:43 PM",Sush, And will be v embarrassed if I fail to meet my v v v meagre goal of 20 books in 2017
85,"10/12/17, 11:20:09 PM",Nikhil, I just finished 3 books of the gentleman bastards series - fantasy version of oceans 11 with extra drama and some magic
86,"10/12/17, 11:20:16 PM",Nikhil, Don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs your type though
87,"10/12/17, 11:20:24 PM",Nikhil, Even though it‚Äôs quite well written
88,"10/12/17, 11:20:47 PM",Sush, Aah it sounds like too much
89,"18/12/17, 5:21:17 AM",Sush, Hii
90,"18/12/17, 9:01:58 AM",Nikhil, hey 
91,"18/12/17, 9:02:10 AM",Nikhil, how's it going?
92,"18/12/17, 9:53:48 AM",Sush, It's going okayyy!
93,"18/12/17, 9:53:51 AM",Sush, How are you?
94,"18/12/17, 1:26:52 PM",Nikhil, Last week on my rather annoying project
95,"18/12/17, 1:27:49 PM",Nikhil, Doing those labs again for the rest of the country
96,"18/12/17, 1:27:54 PM",Nikhil, On break yet?
97,"18/12/17, 1:28:13 PM",Nikhil, Ah yes you mentioned 
98,"18/12/17, 11:10:27 PM",Sush, Ohhh
99,"18/12/17, 11:10:37 PM",Sush, Yesss I'm in Hyderabad
100,"19/12/17, 12:52:20 AM",Nikhil," I feel like you were there very recently, relatively speaking, but I‚Äôm assuming that‚Äôs just days blurring"
101,"19/12/17, 12:52:26 AM",Nikhil, How‚Äôs being home though?
102,"19/12/17, 12:53:17 AM",Sush, No I was haha
103,"19/12/17, 12:53:25 AM",Sush, I was here in September
104,"19/12/17, 12:53:39 AM",Sush, Home is good!
105,"19/12/17, 12:56:14 AM",Sush, I ended up starting Anna Karenina
106,"19/12/17, 12:56:50 AM",Nikhil, Haha
107,"19/12/17, 12:57:35 AM",Sush, It alternates between being exciting and leaving me extra melancholy
108,"19/12/17, 3:05:36 AM",Sush, Can you look at a draft of my resume?!
109,"19/12/17, 3:05:46 AM",Sush, It's a preliminary draft - be harsh?
110,"19/12/17, 3:05:58 AM",Sush, I want to use it for McKinsey
111,"19/12/17, 3:06:10 AM",Sush, Data science position
112,"19/12/17, 3:47:11 AM",Nikhil," Of course, send through "
113,"19/12/17, 3:48:03 AM",Nikhil, Is there a deadline?
114,"[19/12/17, 3:48:47 AM",Sush, untitled ‚Ä¢ ‚Äé1 page ‚Äédocument omitted
115,"19/12/17, 3:49:06 AM",Sush, Thanks!
116,"19/12/17, 3:49:13 AM",Sush, Is it better to email?
117,"19/12/17, 3:49:16 AM",Sush, No there isn't
118,"19/12/17, 3:49:35 AM",Sush, But I want to get the applications out while I'm in india
119,"19/12/17, 4:04:06 AM",Nikhil, Ah ok. I‚Äôll try for tomorrow but may be more realistic by Friday 
120,"19/12/17, 4:04:25 AM",Sush, That works!!
121,"19/12/17, 4:04:30 AM",Sush, Thank you 
122,"19/12/17, 4:04:58 AM",Sush, Have you seen The Crown?
123,"19/12/17, 4:11:13 AM",Nikhil, Yep... season 2 is depressing though
124,"19/12/17, 4:11:19 AM",Nikhil, I‚Äôm about halfway through it
125,"19/12/17, 4:15:40 AM",Sush, Yeah I'm two episodes in
126,"19/12/17, 4:15:45 AM",Sush, It's been a lot of Philip
127,"19/12/17, 5:33:20 AM",Nikhil, So apparently they just fired a missile from Yemen next to the hotel we are at right now
128,"19/12/17, 5:34:12 AM",Sush, !!!!
129,"19/12/17, 5:34:31 AM",Sush, Are you being asked to evacuate?!
130,"19/12/17, 5:34:45 AM",Nikhil," No, not yet"
131,"19/12/17, 5:35:04 AM",Nikhil," I mean, I think it was intercepted and stuff"
132,"19/12/17, 5:35:18 AM",Nikhil, but we were wondering whether we should
133,"19/12/17, 5:35:25 AM",Sush, Wait where are you again?
134,"19/12/17, 5:35:39 AM",Nikhil, We're holding an event for like 300 people so this would be a whole deal
135,"19/12/17, 5:35:45 AM",Sush, Damn!!
136,"19/12/17, 5:35:49 AM",Nikhil, Riyadh
137,"19/12/17, 5:36:11 AM",Nikhil," I mean I'm sure it would be a whole deal anyway, we're in the middle of the city"
138,"19/12/17, 5:36:59 AM",Sush, I hope you guys decide to evacuate!!
139,"19/12/17, 5:37:46 AM",Nikhil, Realistically I don't think we're at a particularly higher risk than we were before
140,"19/12/17, 5:37:53 AM",Nikhil, I'm just reevaluating what that risk level is
141,"19/12/17, 5:39:21 AM",Sush, Makes sense. This is scary!
142,"19/12/17, 5:39:57 AM",Nikhil, 2 more days and then I'm off for 3 weeks 
143,"19/12/17, 5:40:08 AM",Sush, Lovely!
144,"19/12/17, 5:40:08 AM",Nikhil, flying from riyadh tomorrow night and then to kerala on thursday night
145,"19/12/17, 5:40:12 AM",Nikhil, *to dubai
146,"19/12/17, 5:40:15 AM",Nikhil, and then kera;a
147,"19/12/17, 5:40:24 AM",Nikhil, and then new zealand 
148,"19/12/17, 5:40:39 AM",Sush, Next time I come to India I'll plan a layover in Dubai?!
149,"19/12/17, 5:40:53 AM",Sush, If you guys are in town then ofc
150,"19/12/17, 5:41:14 AM",Sush, Ooh New Zealand! Family trip?
151,"19/12/17, 5:41:46 AM",Sush, Although I won't be back in India for another eight or so months lol
152,"19/12/17, 5:42:26 AM",Nikhil," Yes, visit!"
153,"19/12/17, 5:42:56 AM",Nikhil, Although doesn't really work unless its a weekend since I may not be in town 
154,"19/12/17, 5:42:59 AM",Nikhil, Yeah family trip
155,"19/12/17, 5:43:12 AM",Sush, Ok will keep that in mind!
156,"19/12/17, 5:43:17 AM",Sush, Fun!!
157,"19/12/17, 5:45:19 AM",Sush, Family means yours or Mia's or both?
158,"19/12/17, 5:48:59 AM",Nikhil," So we‚Äôre doing 3.5 days in Trivandrum with her family, 1.5 days in Cochin with my extended family, then 8 days in nz with my family."
159,"19/12/17, 8:33:39 PM",Sush, Nice!
160,"22/12/17, 2:28:28 AM",Sush, I have to get spectacles üòê
161,"22/12/17, 2:28:58 AM",Nikhil, This is such an awful question but haven‚Äôt you had them before?
162,"22/12/17, 2:29:04 AM",Sush, Hahahaha noooo
163,"22/12/17, 2:29:11 AM",Sush, Now I'm wondering if you have them
164,"22/12/17, 2:29:34 AM",Sush, I want to say no?
165,"22/12/17, 2:29:35 AM",Nikhil, Also i was going to ask if you ever mailed me your resume and then I scrolled up and saw you sent on WhatsApp
166,"22/12/17, 2:29:39 AM",Nikhil, Will go through now
167,"22/12/17, 2:29:41 AM",Nikhil, No 
168,"22/12/17, 2:29:48 AM",Sush, Thanks! Should I email instead?
169,"22/12/17, 2:31:47 AM",Nikhil, Nah I mailed it to myself
170,"22/12/17, 2:31:48 AM",Nikhil, So
171,"22/12/17, 2:31:51 AM",Nikhil, As a rule
172,"22/12/17, 2:32:25 AM",Nikhil," Most companies now tend to prefer resumes where you lost accomplishments rather than ‚Äúresponsible for‚Äù, which is fairly limited in what it conveys"
173,"22/12/17, 2:32:53 AM",Sush, Hmm okay. So more 'active' words?
174,"22/12/17, 2:33:19 AM",Sush," What I improved, optimised etc?"
175,"22/12/17, 2:33:34 AM",Sush, I also realise there are no quantified accomplishments
176,"22/12/17, 2:36:37 AM",Nikhil, Yes
177,"22/12/17, 2:36:38 AM",Nikhil, To both
178,"22/12/17, 2:37:09 AM",Nikhil," Even if what you did was par for the course for your job , make it sound like an accomplishment"
179,"22/12/17, 2:37:19 AM",Nikhil, And quantify as far as possible
180,"22/12/17, 2:37:33 AM",Sush, Okay!üòÖ
181,"22/12/17, 2:38:46 AM",Nikhil, Also you said you‚Äôre applying for an analytics program at Mckinsey and not standard consulting track? Because these are all very much in that vein - you‚Äôd have to rewrite a lot for consulting track
182,"22/12/17, 2:39:19 AM",Sush," Yes! I'm looking at analytics positions, not consulting"
183,"22/12/17, 2:39:44 AM",Sush, Out of academic interest - what would have to be different for consulting?
184,"22/12/17, 2:39:59 AM",Sush, Also - does it make sense that I've left out my undergrad internships?
185,"22/12/17, 2:40:11 AM",Sush, Except the last one
186,"22/12/17, 2:40:17 AM",Sush," ISB, IFMR"
187,"22/12/17, 2:43:07 AM",Nikhil, Even so given that it‚Äôs a consulting firm I‚Äôd change some things 
188,"22/12/17, 2:44:15 AM",Nikhil," For consulting in general, much more focus on quantified impact rather than skills"
189,"22/12/17, 2:45:20 AM",Nikhil," Yeah - you could put a line for each of the undergrad internships if you have space and you did something very impressive, but I wouldn‚Äôt forcefit"
190,"22/12/17, 2:46:30 AM",Nikhil, Your IFMR section is pretty spot on 
191,"22/12/17, 2:46:56 AM",Sush, Hahah ok!
192,"22/12/17, 2:47:01 AM",Sush, Ok that's useful!!
193,"22/12/17, 2:47:50 AM",Nikhil, Add machine learning to skills actually.
194,"22/12/17, 2:47:53 AM",Nikhil, No?
195,"22/12/17, 2:48:07 AM",Sush, Ooh ok! Ya I was wondering about that
196,"22/12/17, 2:48:25 AM",Sush, Taking a deep learning class this quarter too maybe
197,"22/12/17, 2:48:37 AM",Nikhil, Add away üòõ
198,"22/12/17, 2:48:56 AM",Sush, Hahaha
199,"22/12/17, 2:49:03 AM",Sush, This all makes sense
200,"22/12/17, 2:49:11 AM",Nikhil, And can you beef up the compass lexicon section?
201,"22/12/17, 2:49:21 AM",Sush, Do you think th  projects section is fluffy?
202,"22/12/17, 2:49:43 AM",Nikhil, You can‚Äôt put details of cases you did I assume but maybe something on what the stuff was for? To add flavor if nothing else
203,"22/12/17, 2:49:50 AM",Sush, Ya I should! I'm thinking about how to do this since I can't put case details
204,"22/12/17, 2:49:52 AM",Nikhil," That‚Äôs the most relevant experience you have, right?"
205,"22/12/17, 2:49:56 AM",Sush, Yeah
206,"22/12/17, 2:52:13 AM",Nikhil," Right now it doesn‚Äôt particularly stand out from the rest - I would add something regarding the scale of the cases (in litigation involving $X M in the Y sector). Don‚Äôt put ‚Äúreviewed and edited reports‚Äù, which seems like proofreading work, put ‚Äúprepared and contributed to reports presenting ...‚Äù"
207,"22/12/17, 2:52:38 AM",Sush, Good idea! Will add
208,"22/12/17, 2:53:36 AM",Nikhil," Projects don‚Äôt seem fluffy (to me, a non expert)"
209,"22/12/17, 2:54:21 AM",Nikhil," But I would add what exactly you did, maybe. Like I assume the first 3 are created and the last is contributed to?"
210,"22/12/17, 2:56:28 AM",Sush, Ya I added the last one for something outside school
211,"22/12/17, 2:56:33 AM",Sush, That also I created only
212,"22/12/17, 2:57:01 AM",Sush, I def need to rewrite the compass lexecon section!
213,"22/12/17, 2:57:06 AM",Sush, It looks v underwhelming
214,"22/12/17, 2:58:39 AM",Nikhil, Then definitely say that
215,"22/12/17, 3:05:05 AM",Sush, Ok I'll do a serious rehaul tonight
216,"22/12/17, 3:06:52 AM",Nikhil, Too harsh? 
217,"22/12/17, 3:07:06 AM",Sush, No no! I wanted this 
218,"22/12/17, 3:07:28 AM",Sush, I was really unimpressed with it lol
219,"22/12/17, 3:07:57 AM",Nikhil, Haha
220,"22/12/17, 3:08:25 AM",Sush, You've given me many concrete things to change so that's a relatively easy start to make
221,"22/12/17, 3:08:35 AM",Sush, And I agree with what you say
222,"31/12/17, 11:42:43 PM",Nikhil, Happy new year!
223,"01/01/18, 12:44:22 AM",Sush, Thank you! Happy new year!!
224,"10/01/18, 3:42:36 PM",Sush, Compass Lexecon made an offer 
225,"10/01/18, 4:01:16 PM",Sush, I can't tell if it's a good offer tho!
226,"10/01/18, 5:41:01 PM",Sush, Ok it isn't!
227,"10/01/18, 5:41:16 PM",Sush, Who knows what I'm worth tho ugh
228,"11/01/18, 1:10:55 AM",Nikhil, Congrats!
229,"11/01/18, 1:10:58 AM",Nikhil, What is it and how do you know it isn‚Äôt a good offer?
230,"11/01/18, 9:23:17 AM",Sush, It's Senior Analyst
231,"11/01/18, 9:23:31 AM",Sush, They don't have the same Analyst -associate hierarchy
232,"11/01/18, 9:23:53 AM",Sush, You become 'economist' when you're promoted from Senior Analyst
233,"11/01/18, 9:24:11 AM",Sush, It isn't enough $ for a job I'm not v interested in!
234,"11/01/18, 9:27:56 AM",Sush, and there's no travel at all
235,"11/01/18, 9:28:34 AM",Sush, The only people I'd interact with would be my boss and maybe 2 other analysts
236,"11/01/18, 9:28:56 AM",Sush, Besidessss i wouldn't be using anything from my current degree
237,"11/01/18, 9:29:05 AM",Sush, I could easily have done it with skills from insti
238,"11/01/18, 9:30:01 AM",Sush, am I studying literally all day for 2 years to never use this all again?!
239,"11/01/18, 11:39:39 AM",Nikhil," So my flight is taking off now, but this doesn‚Äôt sound THAT bad"
240,"11/01/18, 11:39:58 AM",Nikhil, I promise you that you‚Äôll see no travel as a perk if you actually had to do it every week
241,"11/01/18, 11:40:31 AM",Nikhil," The limited team isn‚Äôt great but I‚Äôm sure it will be more people in practice and, in any case, doesn‚Äôt have to suck"
242,"11/01/18, 11:41:19 AM",Nikhil," The degree relevance thing, alas, is true for like 90% of all jobs, even for people coming out of grad school, I think"
243,"11/01/18, 11:41:37 AM",Sush, I guess 
244,"11/01/18, 11:41:42 AM",Sush, I don't WANT to thoughhh
245,"11/01/18, 11:42:00 AM",Sush, but it feels crazy to turn it down without a concrete offer in hand
246,"11/01/18, 11:43:48 AM",Nikhil," I know what you mean, but all that said, if you think you‚Äôll be miserable, you should turn it down nonetheless"
247,"11/01/18, 11:44:05 AM",Nikhil, News from trumps America RE h1b visas is sounding a little scary though
248,"11/01/18, 11:44:16 AM",Nikhil, But I assume you‚Äôd know better
249,"11/01/18, 11:44:53 AM",Sush, Yeah 
250,"11/01/18, 11:45:19 AM",Sush, ugh I'll apply aggressively this week
251,"11/01/18, 11:45:25 AM",Sush, to other places
252,"11/01/18, 11:45:31 AM",Nikhil, Do that
253,"11/01/18, 11:45:31 AM",Sush, and buy as much time as i can from CL
254,"11/01/18, 11:45:36 AM",Nikhil, How long do you have?
255,"11/01/18, 11:46:09 AM",Nikhil, And have you applied to like tech companies and stuff? Because I know some of them do economics/data science stuff as well. At least amazon and google do.
256,"11/01/18, 11:46:16 AM",Sush, so they're sending me an official offer on monday and will let me know then how much time i'll have
257,"11/01/18, 11:46:21 AM",Sush, i am doing that now!
258,"11/01/18, 11:46:31 AM",Nikhil, Cool 
259,"11/01/18, 11:46:34 AM",Sush, my professors also think i should do that
260,"11/01/18, 11:48:03 AM",Nikhil," And about the $... how much is it, exactly? (unless you don‚Äôt want to say, of course)"
261,"11/01/18, 11:48:29 AM",Sush, eh it's ok - it's ~ $78k
262,"11/01/18, 11:48:41 AM",Sush, i'd totally do a job i _liked_ for that
263,"11/01/18, 11:48:57 AM",Nikhil, 
264,"11/01/18, 11:49:01 AM",Sush, but it's not enough to be miserable
265,"11/01/18, 11:49:14 AM",Nikhil," No, it‚Äôs not"
266,"11/01/18, 11:49:15 AM",Sush, i think they're lowballing me too!
267,"11/01/18, 11:49:35 AM",Sush, i think i'm overqualified for senior analyst also
268,"11/01/18, 11:49:59 AM",Sush, they keep saying they pay overtime and that adds up to a lot
269,"11/01/18, 11:50:16 AM",Sush, but that's not v convincing
270,"11/01/18, 11:50:26 AM",Nikhil," They might be. Analyst salaries (ie straight out of undergrad) at Mckinsey are around 70k$, I think. And Mckinsey pays less than a lot of boutiques as well as Bain and bcg, counting all the perks."
271,"11/01/18, 11:50:39 AM",Nikhil," They pay overtime? That actually might add up to a lot, no?"
272,"11/01/18, 11:50:57 AM",Sush, they do pay overtime and i've def seen people work like 70 hour weeks
273,"11/01/18, 11:51:30 AM",Sush, that's what they say - that with overtime you end up making more than similar companies than don't pay overtime
274,"11/01/18, 11:51:33 AM",Sush, which might be true
275,"11/01/18, 11:52:34 AM",Nikhil, You can probably do a rough estimate once you get the detailed offer. And if it adds another 30% or so maybe you‚Äôll find some redeeming value in the whole thing 
276,"11/01/18, 11:52:58 AM",Sush," for this - apart from being kind of boring, i think i'm also good at talking about/ presenting my work, collaborating etc - and it wouldn't be fun to be in a job where i can't do those things"
277,"11/01/18, 11:53:38 AM",Nikhil," Even if you‚Äôre only working with the limited team, won‚Äôt you end up presenting stuff to clients at some point or the other?"
278,"11/01/18, 11:53:41 AM",Sush, plus i'd add more value / do better in a role that's more suited to my natural skills etc
279,"11/01/18, 11:54:07 AM",Sush, not really - the principal on the team is the expert witness in court
280,"11/01/18, 11:54:15 AM",Nikhil, And wouldn‚Äôt any research you do necessitate talking to other experts?
281,"11/01/18, 11:54:25 AM",Nikhil," Ah, ok"
282,"11/01/18, 11:54:28 AM",Sush, to a limited degree
283,"11/01/18, 11:54:35 AM",Sush, it's SUCH a conservative field
284,"11/01/18, 11:55:12 AM",Sush, they use SAS
285,"11/01/18, 11:55:16 AM",Sush, who the fuck uses SAS
286,"11/01/18, 11:55:23 AM",Nikhil, 
287,"11/01/18, 11:55:40 AM",Sush, it literally takes 30 lines of code to do what even stupid Stata can do in 5
288,"11/01/18, 11:56:56 AM",Sush, plus plus i'm LOVING CS / machine learning
289,"11/01/18, 11:57:06 AM",Sush, and it excites me
290,"11/01/18, 11:57:27 AM",Nikhil," I think that might be worth holding out for, then"
291,"11/01/18, 11:57:40 AM",Nikhil," Anyway, you have a little time, and now you have a safety net "
292,"11/01/18, 11:57:57 AM",Nikhil, Flights taking off... talk soon!
293,"11/01/18, 11:58:15 AM",Sush," ok, have a safe flight!"
294,"12/01/18, 12:07:45 AM",Sush, Watch Ladybird!
295,"12/01/18, 2:05:48 AM",Nikhil, Good? Was planning on it for sure
296,"12/01/18, 2:06:22 AM",Nikhil," I watched call me by your name the other day - slept through some of the more intense scenes because I was super drowsy, but overall a lovey film"
297,"12/01/18, 8:17:34 AM",Sush, Oh yeah? The trailer played before Ladybird - I was curious
298,"12/01/18, 8:17:48 AM",Sush, Ladybird was v sweet!
299,"17/01/18, 10:17:41 AM",Sush, you're at cheth's wedding?
300,"17/01/18, 12:19:57 PM",Nikhil, Nope - Vinay had invited but it just wouldn‚Äôt have worked out.
301,"17/01/18, 12:20:09 PM",Sush, ah okay!
302,"17/01/18, 12:20:37 PM",Nikhil, I just had a miserable flight
303,"17/01/18, 12:22:57 PM",Sush, oh no! where to where?
304,"17/01/18, 12:33:47 PM",Nikhil," Riyadh dubai only.  It too long. But it was an hour late, and they made me check in my trolley, I had to buy food that turned out to be crap... honestly, nothing to whine about THAT much but enough to put me in a pissy mood."
305,"17/01/18, 12:34:07 PM",Nikhil, *not too long
306,"17/01/18, 12:34:18 PM",Sush, Ugh fair enough
307,"17/01/18, 12:34:24 PM",Sush, ish 
308,"17/01/18, 12:35:53 PM",Nikhil, And I have work to do and I put it off for a while on the flight and then some dumbass was talking loudly while standing right above me to his friend so I decided to do some work and then just then they came and said we‚Äôre about to land so put your laptops away and then they got stuck in a holding pattern for another 30 minutes
309,"17/01/18, 12:36:11 PM",Sush, üòÖ gross
310,"17/01/18, 12:36:17 PM",Sush, i'm also a bit cheesed off
311,"17/01/18, 12:36:40 PM",Sush, by annoying AF students in my new class who want to contest EVERY grade i give them
312,"17/01/18, 12:36:46 PM",Nikhil, üòä I feel like a 5 year old getting angry for no reason
313,"17/01/18, 12:36:48 PM",Nikhil, Ah 
314,"17/01/18, 12:36:58 PM",Sush, aggressive little brats
315,"17/01/18, 12:37:03 PM",Sush," i mean, not little at ALL"
316,"17/01/18, 12:37:03 PM",Nikhil, Lol
317,"17/01/18, 12:38:07 PM",Nikhil, What course?
318,"17/01/18, 12:38:16 PM",Sush, Computational Modeling
319,"17/01/18, 12:38:33 PM",Sush," regressions, applied ML"
320,"21/01/18, 1:55:26 PM",Sush, would you play taboo with a computer?!
321,"02/02/18, 3:54:50 AM",Nikhil," I mean, how would that work?"
322,"02/02/18, 3:56:05 AM",Nikhil," Also, been a while, how‚Äôs it going?"
323,"02/02/18, 3:56:08 AM",Nikhil, I‚Äôve had a really busy couple of weeks  with work and then in laws on the weekends and now I‚Äôm finally sitting at home with nothing to do. (Deliberately. There‚Äôs lots to do).
324,"02/02/18, 9:55:09 AM",Sush, Hey
325,"02/02/18, 9:56:04 AM",Sush, Nice! Have you taken a couple of days off?
326,"02/02/18, 12:01:20 PM",Nikhil," No no, just a weekend to chill "
327,"02/02/18, 12:09:39 PM",Sush, Ohhh I forgot it was Friday for you!
328,"02/02/18, 12:09:44 PM",Sush, I‚Äôve been asleep all day!
329,"02/02/18, 12:09:48 PM",Sush, It‚Äôs noon
330,"02/02/18, 12:10:01 PM",Sush, Haven‚Äôt read for class üôà
331,"02/02/18, 12:12:38 PM",Sush, It feels like a Saturday!
332,"02/02/18, 1:43:55 PM",Sush, i'm in my 3 hr class and CAN'T EVEN
333,"02/02/18, 1:44:00 PM",Sush, pls entertain me!
334,"03/02/18, 12:39:55 PM",Sush, Useless üòÖ
335,"03/02/18, 12:40:08 PM",Nikhil, Sorry
336,"03/02/18, 12:40:26 PM",Nikhil, Went to watch jumanji with the in laws and then sheesha with my friends 
337,"03/02/18, 12:40:42 PM",Sush, I ended up paying attention üôÑ
338,"03/02/18, 12:40:45 PM",Nikhil, Been at home all day today though
339,"03/02/18, 12:41:11 PM",Sush, I watched Jumanji with some distant family that lives in Wisconsin
340,"03/02/18, 12:41:11 PM",Nikhil, Your 3 hour classes must have breaks no?
341,"03/02/18, 12:41:20 PM",Sush, Yeah it has a break!
342,"03/02/18, 12:41:39 PM",Sush, It‚Äôs a sociology class and I‚Äôm not used to reading so much üò≠
343,"03/02/18, 12:41:55 PM",Nikhil, I liked mine because esp in final sem it meant that I could mostly not go to school for a day at least if I took enough
344,"03/02/18, 12:42:15 PM",Nikhil, Is the class reading or discussion though?
345,"03/02/18, 12:42:47 PM",Sush, Discussion - but there‚Äôs a weekly programming assignment AND a bunch of assigned rewarding
346,"03/02/18, 12:42:51 PM",Sush, *reading
347,"03/02/18, 12:42:57 PM",Sush, So it‚Äôs v v time consuming
348,"03/02/18, 12:43:06 PM",Sush, It‚Äôs Computational Content Analysis
349,"03/02/18, 12:43:08 PM",Nikhil, Yeah but that‚Äôs all before class
350,"03/02/18, 12:43:13 PM",Sush, Yeah!
351,"03/02/18, 12:43:18 PM",Nikhil, So the actual class should be more fun
352,"03/02/18, 12:43:31 PM",Nikhil, I‚Äôve been binge watching altered carbon all day
353,"03/02/18, 12:43:32 PM",Sush, Trueeee but half the time I don‚Äôt get through all the reading
354,"03/02/18, 12:43:46 PM",Sush, What is altered carbon?
355,"03/02/18, 12:43:59 PM",Nikhil, Me neither but at least in bschool I could skim cases quickly and still get some use from the class
356,"03/02/18, 12:44:13 PM",Nikhil, New Netflix show based on a sci-fi novel I‚Äôd never read before
357,"03/02/18, 12:44:16 PM",Nikhil, Pretty decent
358,"03/02/18, 12:44:32 PM",Sush, Oh!
359,"03/02/18, 12:44:53 PM",Sush, Yeah true! I usually like the class but was just super sleepy yesterday
360,"03/02/18, 12:45:00 PM",Nikhil, Just released today
361,"03/02/18, 12:45:05 PM",Sush, Even though I‚Äôd slept ALL MORNING
362,"03/02/18, 12:45:17 PM",Sush, oh! I saw an ad for it last night
363,"03/02/18, 12:45:25 PM",Sush, On the newly released thing
364,"03/02/18, 12:45:52 PM",Sush, So I decided to turn down Compass Lexecon !
365,"03/02/18, 12:46:02 PM",Sush, The work just doesn‚Äôt excite me
366,"03/02/18, 12:46:13 PM",Nikhil, Ooh nice!
367,"03/02/18, 12:46:17 PM",Nikhil, I mean
368,"03/02/18, 12:46:21 PM",Nikhil, That you decided
369,"03/02/18, 12:46:25 PM",Sush, Yeah üòÖ
370,"03/02/18, 12:46:28 PM",Nikhil, So what‚Äôs next?
371,"03/02/18, 12:46:33 PM",Sush, I‚Äôm applying now
372,"03/02/18, 12:46:36 PM",Sush, Let‚Äôs seeeee
373,"03/02/18, 12:46:45 PM",Nikhil, I actually just had a long talk with my cousin who‚Äôs in a very similar position to you
374,"03/02/18, 12:46:47 PM",Sush, I def want to do something a little more data science
375,"03/02/18, 12:46:57 PM",Sush, Yeah? In what sense?
376,"03/02/18, 12:47:34 PM",Nikhil," Almost done with her Econ BA and got an offer she doesn‚Äôt want to take, so she‚Äôs trying to figure out what to do now"
377,"03/02/18, 12:47:56 PM",Sush, Ohhh
378,"03/02/18, 12:48:04 PM",Sush, It‚Äôs scary to turn something down!!
379,"03/02/18, 12:48:35 PM",Sush, My v insightful friend said - it‚Äôs like a fuckboy - you‚Äôre interested because he wants you right now
380,"03/02/18, 12:48:38 PM",Sush, üòÖ
381,"03/02/18, 12:48:39 PM",Nikhil," Yeah but it turns out this is basically a recruiting position, and she wants to do consulting"
382,"03/02/18, 12:48:40 PM",Nikhil, Haha
383,"03/02/18, 12:48:57 PM",Sush, Ohh
384,"03/02/18, 12:49:12 PM",Sush, Will it be a ‚Äòstepping stone‚Äô?
385,"03/02/18, 12:49:27 PM",Nikhil," Not in the company, apparently"
386,"03/02/18, 12:49:45 PM",Nikhil, Problem is she already applied to and got rejected from Mckinsey Bain bcg
387,"03/02/18, 12:50:36 PM",Nikhil, So I advised that she try boutique firms and also maybe pwc Deloitte etc.
388,"03/02/18, 12:51:12 PM",Sush, Oh yeah that‚Äôs a good idea
389,"03/02/18, 12:51:31 PM",Sush, One of my friends from insti has been with pwc for a few years now and he‚Äôs had a good experience
390,"03/02/18, 12:51:47 PM",Sush, econ
391,"03/02/18, 12:52:24 PM",Nikhil, Yeah? What role?
392,"03/02/18, 12:52:37 PM",Sush, Senior consultant or something like that
393,"03/02/18, 12:56:02 PM",Nikhil, So apparently all these firms hire at Xavier and Christ and everything but not Stephens
394,"03/02/18, 12:56:06 PM",Nikhil, Which I found weird
395,"03/02/18, 12:56:27 PM",Nikhil, So I asked her to figure out if they were only offering non consulting roles or anything
396,"03/02/18, 12:56:50 PM",Sush, That is super weird!
397,"03/02/18, 12:57:03 PM",Sush, also so jealous that she was at Stephens
398,"03/02/18, 12:57:19 PM",Sush, There‚Äôs this girl in my econometrics class - econ from Stephens
399,"03/02/18, 12:57:23 PM",Sush, She knows all the math!!
400,"03/02/18, 12:57:36 PM",Sush, Fucking insti
401,"03/02/18, 12:57:56 PM",Sush, she unleashed a fresh wave of insti resentment
402,"03/02/18, 12:57:57 PM",Nikhil, Lol
403,"03/02/18, 12:58:16 PM",Sush, Srsly everything was because our profs were way dumber than us
404,"03/02/18, 12:58:35 PM",Sush, and thought we couldn‚Äôt do math because THEY couldn‚Äôt
405,"03/02/18, 12:58:35 PM",Nikhil, Yeah?
406,"03/02/18, 12:58:56 PM",Sush, For real. All of us had to teach ourselves for after insti
407,"03/02/18, 12:58:59 PM",Sush, And we all did
408,"03/02/18, 12:59:15 PM",Sush, So clearly we could have done so much better if we were just TAUGHT
409,"[03/02/18, 12:59:46 PM",Sush, ‚Äéimage omitted
410,"03/02/18, 1:01:16 PM",Nikhil, Huh

412,"03/02/18, 1:02:50 PM",Sush, Idk if I told you - a good friend of mine knows her!
413,"03/02/18, 1:03:12 PM",Sush, She saw Mia‚Äôs wedding pictures or something and saw that I was a mutual friend with you
414,"03/02/18, 1:03:20 PM",Sush, She asked me when I was in Hyderabad last time
415,"03/02/18, 1:03:50 PM",Sush, I think she knows her from TISB - did Mia go there?
416,"03/02/18, 1:04:14 PM",Sush," Well, we were good friends in high school"
417,"03/02/18, 1:11:03 PM",Nikhil," Yeah, she went to tisb"
418,"03/02/18, 1:11:09 PM",Nikhil, Who‚Äôs this friend?

421,"03/02/18, 1:11:33 PM",Sush," she can er, be kind of a bitch"
422,"03/02/18, 1:11:35 PM",Nikhil, Not that I would know I guess 
423,"03/02/18, 1:11:37 PM",Nikhil, Haha
424,"03/02/18, 1:11:49 PM",Sush, yeah she was defs a 'mean girl' at our school
425,"03/02/18, 1:11:52 PM",Nikhil, Mia‚Äôs good
426,"03/02/18, 1:12:44 PM",Sush, and i was a spineless cliche that stood by as she was mean to other people because she liked me and i didn't want to rock the boat lol
427,"03/02/18, 1:13:01 PM",Nikhil, Her work got a bit more annoying now because they had this big restructuring and most of the more fun people are gone
428,"03/02/18, 1:13:05 PM",Nikhil, Ah 
429,"03/02/18, 1:13:26 PM",Sush, ohh that sucks!
430,"03/02/18, 1:13:41 PM",Sush, it's already hard to find fun people to be friends with as you get older
431,"03/02/18, 1:15:39 PM",Nikhil," I don‚Äôt think any of these people were necessarily FRIENDS, but they at least made work interesting"
432,"03/02/18, 1:15:58 PM",Sush, fair
433,"03/02/18, 1:16:15 PM",Sush, i really wonder how many of my 'new friends' i'll stay in touch with post uchicago
434,"15/02/18, 8:58:13 PM",Sush, hiii
435,"16/02/18, 3:38:43 AM",Nikhil, Hey 
436,"17/02/18, 2:46:40 PM",Sush, You‚Äôre in Tanzania!

438,"17/02/18, 11:24:18 PM",Nikhil," Went for 3 days, mia and her family stayed for 2 more. Very short trip but fun "
439,"18/02/18, 12:21:11 AM",Sush, Niiice
440,"18/02/18, 12:42:04 AM",Nikhil, How are you doing?
441,"18/02/18, 12:42:09 AM",Nikhil, Isn‚Äôt it super late?
442,"18/02/18, 5:46:34 AM",Sush, It was a little past midnight!
443,"18/02/18, 5:51:47 AM",Sush, I‚Äôm up earlyyy
444,"18/02/18, 6:18:29 AM",Nikhil," Very early, no? "
445,"18/02/18, 6:27:36 AM",Sush, Yaaa
446,"18/02/18, 6:27:40 AM",Sush, But I‚Äôm still in bed
447,"18/02/18, 6:27:58 AM",Sush, I imagine successful people would get out of bed and do yoga or run or read or something
448,"18/02/18, 6:28:14 AM",Sush," Sorry, by mistake"
449,"18/02/18, 6:44:32 AM",Nikhil, Meh. It‚Äôs a Sunday. I sleep till at least 10 on my weekends
450,"22/02/18, 1:00:16 PM",Nikhil, Recommend something beautiful for me to read?
451,"22/02/18, 1:00:50 PM",Nikhil," Like, something almost lyrical, but not poetry, but still let‚Äôs you soak the words in"
452,"22/02/18, 1:01:08 PM",Nikhil," Or makes you soak the words in, I suppose"
453,"22/02/18, 3:42:14 PM",Sush, https
454,"22/02/18, 3:42:30 PM",Sush, It‚Äôs not lyrical at all but I liked this story a lot!
455,"22/02/18, 3:42:45 PM",Sush, I heard it on the fiction podcast
456,"22/02/18, 3:44:37 PM",Sush, How are you?
457,"22/02/18, 4:00:20 PM",Sush, I‚Äôm going to have a tiny little dinner party
458,"22/02/18, 4:00:25 PM",Sush, Just for three people
459,"22/02/18, 4:00:29 PM",Sush, but I‚Äôm excited!
460,"22/02/18, 4:05:08 PM",Nikhil," Seems interesting, even though it‚Äôs. Or quite what I wanted "
461,"22/02/18, 4:05:17 PM",Nikhil," I‚Äôm good, had a relatively relaxed week"
462,"22/02/18, 4:05:27 PM",Nikhil, Who‚Äôs the dinner party for?
463,"22/02/18, 4:05:56 PM",Sush, Just three friends who want Indian food lol
464,"22/02/18, 4:06:03 PM",Sush, It‚Äôs just a casual dinner
465,"22/02/18, 4:06:18 PM",Sush, But I‚Äôm cleaning my house and lighting candles so I‚Äôm excited
466,"22/02/18, 4:06:24 PM",Nikhil," Well, I‚Äôm sure it will still be fun "
467,"22/02/18, 4:06:33 PM",Nikhil, I haven‚Äôt ever really done this
468,"22/02/18, 4:06:37 PM",Sush, ya and I like all three a lot
469,"22/02/18, 4:06:45 PM",Sush, I looove doing it!
470,"22/02/18, 4:06:53 PM",Sush, I like cooking a lot
471,"22/02/18, 4:14:47 PM",Nikhil, Aww
472,"22/02/18, 4:14:51 PM",Nikhil, That was sad
473,"22/02/18, 4:14:59 PM",Nikhil, The story I mean. I just finished it.
474,"22/02/18, 4:15:09 PM",Sush, No?!
475,"22/02/18, 4:15:22 PM",Sush, the poor little child
476,"22/02/18, 4:16:12 PM",Nikhil, I‚Äôve had little house parties before but never ones where i‚Äôve cooked anything beyond pasta or omlettes for late night munchies. And Mia hates cooking so it‚Äôs really just stuff we order or reheat
477,"22/02/18, 4:16:37 PM",Sush, Ah okay! Cooking is way too much work if you don‚Äôt actually like it
478,"22/02/18, 4:18:09 PM",Nikhil, Yeah exactly
479,"22/02/18, 4:18:33 PM",Nikhil," And I enjoy it for myself, but only things that don‚Äôt need too much patience."
480,"25/02/18, 3:17:36 PM",Sush, Hello! 
481,"25/02/18, 3:17:38 PM",Sush, How's your weekend?
482,"26/02/18, 1:39:02 PM",Nikhil, Hey
483,"26/02/18, 1:39:34 PM",Nikhil, Very relaxed 
484,"26/02/18, 1:41:44 PM",Nikhil, How‚Äôs it going?
485,"27/02/18, 5:02:26 PM",Sush, Nice! I haven‚Äôt played badminton in yeaaaaarrsss
486,"27/02/18, 5:02:54 PM",Sush, I‚Äôm having kind of a shitty day!
487,"28/02/18, 12:14:06 AM",Nikhil, What happened?
488,"01/03/18, 12:27:54 AM",Sush, combination of work stress + PMS + exhaustion
489,"01/03/18, 12:27:58 AM",Sush, it sucked!
490,"01/03/18, 12:28:05 AM",Sush, but today i ate my body weight in gelato
491,"01/03/18, 2:16:16 AM",Nikhil, Do you also basically mean time of the month when you say PMS or is it like a non reason reason?
492,"01/03/18, 2:17:17 AM",Sush, No i actually mean Premenstrual syndrome
493,"01/03/18, 2:18:13 AM",Sush, Often I‚Äôll cry for no reason or get inordinately upset at something and then get my period a day later
494,"01/03/18, 2:18:29 AM",Nikhil, Ah
495,"01/03/18, 2:18:29 AM",Sush, I used to think it was a myth when I was younger!!
496,"01/03/18, 2:18:34 AM",Nikhil, Lol
497,"01/03/18, 2:18:47 AM",Sush, Started noticing it a lot at ~21
498,"01/03/18, 2:19:03 AM",Sush, Now I‚Äôm up playing with a side project
499,"01/03/18, 2:19:11 AM",Sush, Without sleeping or studying
500,"01/03/18, 2:19:11 AM",Nikhil, Mia has pretty intense cramps which she calls PMS and I always thought that was supposed to mean something else
501,"01/03/18, 2:19:19 AM",Nikhil, What side project?
502,"01/03/18, 2:19:41 AM",Sush, A couple of friends and I are working on a little website
503,"01/03/18, 2:19:55 AM",Sush, Where we just host tiny data science things we make
504,"01/03/18, 2:20:22 AM",Sush, Part portfolio part fun part documenting our soc sci in data sci journey
505,"01/03/18, 2:20:46 AM",Sush, I‚Äôm making a tiny little thing visualising networks etc from WhatsApp group chats
506,"01/03/18, 2:21:10 AM",Nikhil, Ooh nice!
507,"01/03/18, 2:21:31 AM",Nikhil, That sounds very cool 
508,"01/03/18, 2:21:31 AM",Sush, It‚Äôs called Very Fun Data Science üëª
509,"01/03/18, 2:21:42 AM",Nikhil, Do you have something up already?
510,"01/03/18, 2:21:47 AM",Sush, Not yet!
511,"01/03/18, 2:22:01 AM",Nikhil," Ok, let me know!"
512,"01/03/18, 2:22:07 AM",Sush, I will! We‚Äôre pretty exited
513,"01/03/18, 2:22:12 AM",Nikhil, What are you using to build the site?
514,"01/03/18, 2:22:17 AM",Sush, Ruby
515,"01/03/18, 2:22:29 AM",Sush, My friend Haylee is doing most of that though
516,"01/03/18, 2:22:59 AM",Sush, We just made ourselves admin login and got markdown working on it this week üòç
517,"01/03/18, 2:26:18 AM",Nikhil," What kind of things do you plan to put on? Is it visualizations only or are you going to try, like, let‚Äôs analyze this interesting question using lots of public data?"
518,"01/03/18, 2:27:43 AM",Sush, Mostly the latter!
519,"01/03/18, 2:27:53 AM",Sush, Visualisations only in aid of the latter
520,"01/03/18, 2:28:26 AM",Sush, Or just fun things like using ML to predict the winter of the bachelor!
521,"01/03/18, 2:28:47 AM",Nikhil, Awesome üòé
522,"01/03/18, 2:28:56 AM",Sush, Ya it‚Äôs been fun!
523,"01/03/18, 2:29:10 AM",Sush, Have I shown you www.veryfuntweets.com ?
524,"01/03/18, 2:29:19 AM",Nikhil, Nope
525,"01/03/18, 2:29:24 AM",Sush, See!
526,"01/03/18, 2:29:49 AM",Sush, the data is v old and limited
527,"01/03/18, 2:29:53 AM",Sush, so try these -  www.veryfuntweets.com/checkup
528,"01/03/18, 9:21:34 AM",Sush, did you seeee
529,"01/03/18, 9:21:53 AM",Nikhil, I tried but maybe it‚Äôs not working properly on mobile?
530,"01/03/18, 9:22:03 AM",Sush, ugh maybe
531,"01/03/18, 9:22:36 AM",Sush, look at it on your browser when you‚Äôre free!
532,"01/03/18, 9:24:12 AM",Sush, so weird it should work ok on mobile
533,"01/03/18, 9:24:16 AM",Sush, works ok on mine
534,"01/03/18, 9:24:30 AM",Sush," anyway, not important"
535,"01/03/18, 9:24:44 AM",Sush, I was just saying that‚Äôs the first project the three of us did together
536,"01/03/18, 9:24:54 AM",Sush, for a CS class
537,"[01/03/18, 9:54:39 AM",Nikhil, ‚Äéimage omitted

545,"18/03/18, 3:44:58 PM",Nikhil, Congrats!
546,"18/03/18, 3:45:11 PM",Nikhil," Wait, is this the end of the year or just this term?"
547,"18/03/18, 3:46:32 PM",Sush, end of the term only 
548,"18/03/18, 3:46:38 PM",Sush, and i basically have 2 days off
549,"18/03/18, 3:46:43 PM",Sush, but i will enjoy them!
550,"18/03/18, 3:49:17 PM",Nikhil, You have Monday and Tuesday off? That seems awkward 
551,"18/03/18, 3:49:31 PM",Nikhil, You must have finished last Friday no?
552,"18/03/18, 3:50:06 PM",Sush, ya i finished on friday!
553,"18/03/18, 3:50:14 PM",Sush, well i have the week off technically
554,"18/03/18, 3:50:23 PM",Sush, but the first draft of my thesis is due april 1
555,"18/03/18, 3:50:26 PM",Nikhil, Any plans?
556,"18/03/18, 3:50:38 PM",Sush, so i figured i'll take the weekend off and then get writing
557,"18/03/18, 3:51:17 PM",Nikhil, You should find some nice idyllic lakeside cabin to escape to for the week and do your writing there 
558,"18/03/18, 3:51:37 PM",Sush, i'm just going to relax here!
559,"18/03/18, 3:51:51 PM",Sush, my friend and i went on a 10k walk yesterday
560,"18/03/18, 3:52:01 PM",Sush, along the lake and to a little japanese garden etc 
561,"18/03/18, 3:52:02 PM",Nikhil, Ooh

563,"18/03/18, 3:52:25 PM",Sush, so i'm just going to relax here
564,"18/03/18, 3:52:25 PM",Nikhil," Must still be super cold, right?"
565,"18/03/18, 3:52:33 PM",Sush, it is 8 C today!
566,"18/03/18, 3:52:39 PM",Sush, it's a _glorious_ day
567,"18/03/18, 3:52:48 PM",Nikhil, Haha
568,"18/03/18, 3:52:55 PM",Nikhil, Our standards are different
569,"18/03/18, 3:53:06 PM",Sush, two midwestern winters have changed mine 
570,"18/03/18, 3:53:51 PM",Nikhil," In LA I would whine if it dipped below 18. Here too, come to think of it. But it lasts barely a month here so not much reason to complain."
571,"18/03/18, 3:56:49 PM",Sush, So spoiled üòÖ
572,"18/03/18, 3:57:20 PM",Sush, Yesterday was like 3 degrees and I was outdoors for 3 hours
573,"18/03/18, 3:59:02 PM",Nikhil," Next is your last ever term, right?"
574,"18/03/18, 3:59:08 PM",Nikhil, How are you feeling? 
575,"22/03/18, 5:46:02 PM",Sush, yes it isss!
576,"22/03/18, 5:46:07 PM",Sush, i'm a little sad it's going to be over!
577,"26/03/18, 11:17:55 PM",Sush, hello hello
578,"27/03/18, 1:08:03 AM",Nikhil, Hey 
579,"27/03/18, 9:05:32 PM",Sush, Hiii!
580,"27/03/18, 9:05:42 PM",Sush, be a good friend and send me some moral support
581,"09/04/18, 3:32:25 PM",Sush, No one wants to hire me!
582,"09/04/18, 3:32:36 PM",Sush, You
583,"09/04/18, 3:32:43 PM",Sush, *whywhywhy
584,"09/04/18, 4:07:53 PM",Nikhil, I thought you already had a job
585,"09/04/18, 5:10:14 PM",Sush, I turned it down
586,"09/04/18, 5:10:32 PM",Sush, I _really_ don‚Äôt want to do econ consulting
587,"09/04/18, 11:52:01 PM",Nikhil, Ah yes I remember. But at least someone offered you one 
588,"09/04/18, 11:52:20 PM",Nikhil, Is it near the end of recruiting season or still early?
589,"09/04/18, 11:52:29 PM",Nikhil, And what exactly are you looking for now?
590,"06/05/18, 1:23:27 PM",Sush, sorry i totally forgot to reply to this
591,"06/05/18, 1:23:34 PM",Sush, after _i_ started whining haha
592,"06/05/18, 1:23:39 PM",Sush, but - data science!
593,"06/05/18, 1:23:44 PM",Sush, how are youuuu??
594,"06/05/18, 1:23:56 PM",Sush, i'm done with thesis! üëØ‚Äç‚ôÄüëØ‚Äç‚ôÄ
595,"06/05/18, 3:51:22 PM",Nikhil, Awesome üòé
596,"06/05/18, 3:51:53 PM",Nikhil, I‚Äôm on a project that is turning out to be fairly sucky
597,"06/05/18, 3:52:17 PM",Nikhil," It was supposed to be super interesting, and the topic is fairly cool, but the clients are being really difficult"
598,"06/05/18, 3:55:40 PM",Sush, ayy in what way?
599,"06/05/18, 3:55:44 PM",Sush," difficult, i mean"
600,"11/05/18, 3:32:41 AM",Nikhil," So, long story"
601,"11/05/18, 3:33:02 AM",Nikhil, Apparently even when we first started the main client thought the EM was too young or cocky or whatever
602,"11/05/18, 3:33:23 AM",Nikhil," (The manager, I mean, the person leading the on site team)"
603,"11/05/18, 3:33:49 AM",Nikhil," Now, this is ... partially true, but not to the extent that it should matter"
604,"11/05/18, 3:34:14 AM",Nikhil," Then, they kept being difficult to deal with in a normal fashion and we couldn‚Äôt align on exactly how to do stuff"
605,"11/05/18, 3:34:42 AM",Nikhil," Now it‚Äôs week 5 and they‚Äôre saying you guys didn‚Äôt do what we wanted, you‚Äôve not been productive enough, we want to pause the study"
606,"11/05/18, 3:35:29 AM",Nikhil," Which, of course, is a pretty big frigging deal - haven‚Äôt really seen this kind of thing before, although of course I‚Äôm sure it happens once in a blue moon"
607,"11/05/18, 3:35:45 AM",Nikhil, Not a great outcome for anyone
608,"11/05/18, 3:35:55 AM",Nikhil, Aanyway. How are you?
609,"11/05/18, 3:36:16 AM",Nikhil, It‚Äôs been a while 
610,"11/05/18, 6:05:05 AM",Sush, Let‚Äôs say I‚Äôm recruiting gently lol
611,"11/05/18, 6:05:20 AM",Sush, That sounds like a stressful situation to be in!
612,"11/05/18, 6:40:57 AM",Nikhil, Yep
613,"11/05/18, 6:41:07 AM",Nikhil, Where all are you applying?
614,"11/05/18, 6:41:36 AM",Sush, I‚Äôm interviewing with two companies now
615,"11/05/18, 6:41:57 AM",Sush," One in Chicago, one in Boston"
616,"11/05/18, 6:42:11 AM",Sush, such a slowwww process tho
617,"11/05/18, 6:42:37 AM",Nikhil, Yeah I know
618,"11/05/18, 6:43:19 AM",Nikhil, What kind of companies?
619,"11/05/18, 6:45:20 AM",Sush, Uptake in Chicago does ‚Äòindustrial predictive analytics‚Äô
620,"11/05/18, 6:45:53 AM",Sush, True Fit in Boston is a start up that predicts clothing sizes based on purchase history and analysing comments etc
621,"11/05/18, 6:46:35 AM",Nikhil, I want to do these things 
622,"11/05/18, 6:46:57 AM",Sush, I hope I get to do them!
623,"11/05/18, 6:47:01 AM",Sush, Both jobs sound fun
624,"11/05/18, 6:47:23 AM",Sush, The uptake data science team is also v active in all these open science communities
625,"11/05/18, 6:47:52 AM",Sush, I‚Äôm slightly nervous because I got rejected after an on site interview from this job that I honestly thought I was too good for lol
626,"11/05/18, 6:48:17 AM",Nikhil, Yeah?
627,"11/05/18, 6:48:28 AM",Sush, like there wasn‚Äôt a single technical question they asked me that I couldn‚Äôt have answered a year ago even
628,"11/05/18, 6:48:33 AM",Nikhil, How much do these guys care about the visa issues?
629,"11/05/18, 6:48:46 AM",Sush, I mean I have my STEM extension.
630,"11/05/18, 6:48:54 AM",Sush, so not that much at this point I think
631,"11/05/18, 6:49:03 AM",Sush, because I have 3 years anyway
632,"11/05/18, 6:49:06 AM",Nikhil, Ah right
633,"11/05/18, 6:49:10 AM",Sush, and they did say they‚Äôd sponsor
634,"11/05/18, 6:49:28 AM",Sush, Idk though
635,"11/05/18, 6:49:43 AM",Sush, I wonder if it was a fit thing or something
636,"11/05/18, 6:49:58 AM",Sush, because I‚Äôm p sure I come off normal and reasonable in person
637,"11/05/18, 6:50:29 AM",Nikhil, I‚Äôm assuming the average employee spends less than 3 years at most of these jobs so I guess that‚Äôs really not an issue then.
638,"11/05/18, 6:50:35 AM",Sush, Yeah
639,"11/05/18, 6:50:57 AM",Sush, and they did have quite a few international employees
640,"11/05/18, 6:51:12 AM",Nikhil," Hmm. Yeah, but sometimes it‚Äôs just very random feelings that some one person has"
641,"11/05/18, 6:51:15 AM",Sush, It was just weird because the interviews were easy
642,"11/05/18, 6:51:24 AM",Sush, Yeah
643,"11/05/18, 6:51:37 AM",Sush, Like I don‚Äôt Think I‚Äôd have accepted if they‚Äôd made an offer
644,"11/05/18, 6:51:44 AM",Sush, It sounded dull and not like much money
645,"11/05/18, 6:51:56 AM",Sush, but like why did THEY say no to me lol
646,"11/05/18, 6:53:25 AM",Nikhil, Lol
647,"11/05/18, 6:53:39 AM",Nikhil, My Deloitte interviews felt like this üòõ
648,"11/05/18, 6:53:49 AM",Sush, Yeah? üòÖ
649,"11/05/18, 6:53:57 AM",Sush, Maybe they pick up in disinterest idk
650,"11/05/18, 6:54:09 AM",Nikhil, That‚Äôs also possible
651,"11/05/18, 6:58:55 AM",Sush, I actually have a coding interview with true fit today
652,"11/05/18, 10:33:51 AM",Nikhil, Ooh. Best of luck!
653,"11/05/18, 1:20:27 PM",Sush, i hate this one student -_-
654,"11/05/18, 1:20:40 PM",Nikhil, Hmm?
655,"11/05/18, 1:28:03 PM",Sush, sorry lol i'm in a problem session
656,"11/05/18, 1:39:17 PM",Sush, i just hate them all sometimes
657,"14/06/18, 12:38:24 PM",Nikhil, Yo
658,"14/06/18, 12:38:48 PM",Nikhil, How‚Äôs it going? Still recruiting?
659,"05/07/18, 9:53:22 PM",Sush, hiii
660,"05/07/18, 9:53:32 PM",Sush, sorry i disappeared a little bit!
661,"05/07/18, 9:53:42 PM",Sush, how are you? 
662,"06/07/18, 1:06:19 AM",Nikhil," Hey! Yes, you did! How‚Äôs it going??"
663,"06/07/18, 1:07:36 AM",Nikhil, I‚Äôm good - just finished the somewhat annoying project i‚Äôve been on for 3 months. Starting my first study as a (junior) manager on Sunday!
664,"06/07/18, 2:22:39 AM",Sush, So cool! Congratulations!
665,"06/07/18, 2:22:45 AM",Sush, I‚Äôm just chilling in Chicago now
666,"06/07/18, 2:22:51 AM",Sush, Enjoying my funemployment
667,"06/07/18, 3:06:51 AM",Nikhil, Enjoy it while it lasts!
668,"06/07/18, 3:06:55 AM",Nikhil, Any leads?
669,"06/07/18, 3:39:23 AM",Sush," Yeah, a couple!"
670,"06/07/18, 3:39:48 AM",Sush, It‚Äôs going slower than I‚Äôd hoped but I‚Äôm also being a little lackadaisical about it
671,"06/07/18, 3:55:11 AM",Nikhil, Yeah it makes sense to take your time and think this through 
672,"06/07/18, 3:55:48 AM",Sush, Yeah 3 months
673,"06/07/18, 3:55:58 AM",Sush, But I won‚Äôt get my authorisation till late August
674,"06/07/18, 3:56:15 AM",Sush, So the three months will start then
675,"06/07/18, 3:56:24 AM",Nikhil, Ah ok
676,"06/07/18, 3:56:29 AM",Sush, Anyhow my personal deadline is September
677,"06/07/18, 4:01:40 AM",Nikhil, Why September?
678,"06/07/18, 4:02:56 AM",Sush," I mean, I‚Äôd like to have something in place when I‚Äôm legally allowed to work"
679,"06/07/18, 4:03:13 AM",Sush, Even if I decide to start a little later I want to have it decided by then
680,"06/07/18, 4:03:55 AM",Nikhil, Fair enough 
681,"06/07/18, 4:04:07 AM",Sush, Just chilling haha it‚Äôs been pretty good
682,"06/07/18, 4:04:17 AM",Sush, I‚Äôm teaching some kids to code a few times a week
683,"06/07/18, 4:04:24 AM",Nikhil, Nice!
684,"06/07/18, 4:04:38 AM",Sush, otherwise I‚Äôm just walking around and reading and not doing too much!
685,"06/07/18, 1:13:44 PM",Sush, If you have book suggestions send them my way!
686,"06/07/18, 1:49:22 PM",Nikhil," So we went to Seychelles for the eid break (which is a thing, if you‚Äôre in Dubai)"
687,"06/07/18, 1:49:52 PM",Nikhil," And I read bourdains ‚Äúa cook‚Äôs tour‚Äù, which worked perfectly for the vacation vibe"
688,"06/07/18, 1:50:36 PM",Nikhil, Otherwise i‚Äôve been reading mostly science fiction and fantasy (which is the staple anyway)
689,"06/07/18, 1:50:57 PM",Nikhil," Oh, I think I told you when I read hillbilly elegy, no?"
690,"06/07/18, 1:51:06 PM",Nikhil, Was a surprisingly good read
691,"06/07/18, 1:51:19 PM",Sush, Ohh I want to read that!
692,"06/07/18, 1:51:24 PM",Sush, I just read Educated
693,"06/07/18, 1:51:33 PM",Sush, Which is kind of similar in theme
694,"06/07/18, 1:51:46 PM",Nikhil, Yeah? Don‚Äôt think i‚Äôve heard about it
695,"06/07/18, 1:52:07 PM",Sush, It‚Äôs about this woman who grew up in this survivalist Mormon family in Idaho
696,"06/07/18, 1:52:28 PM",Nikhil, I thought I told you about reading it and how I‚Äôm feeling like I‚Äôm somehow growing slightly more conservative (in the original rather than Trumpian sense) over time.
697,"06/07/18, 1:52:42 PM",Nikhil, (It=hillbilly elegy)
698,"06/07/18, 1:52:45 PM",Sush," Homeschooled, didn‚Äôt believe in going to the doctor, literally stored up fuel for the end of the world etc"
699,"06/07/18, 1:52:46 PM",Nikhil, Ooh
700,"06/07/18, 1:52:52 PM",Nikhil, Interesting
701,"06/07/18, 1:52:54 PM",Sush," No, I don‚Äôt think we talked about it!"
702,"06/07/18, 1:53:21 PM",Sush, It was also interesting because idk if I‚Äôve mentioned it but like four of my close female friends here are Mormon
703,"06/07/18, 1:53:46 PM",Sush, and one of them was actually homeschooled in Idaho
704,"06/07/18, 2:05:41 PM",Nikhil," No, you didn‚Äôt!"
705,"06/07/18, 2:06:07 PM",Nikhil," I had a few Mormon classmates as well, but the one I was closest to was definitely on the liberal side"
706,"06/07/18, 2:06:17 PM",Nikhil, Aren‚Äôt you watching the World Cup btw?
707,"06/07/18, 2:07:22 PM",Sush, No I‚Äôm not!
708,"06/07/18, 2:07:39 PM",Sush, More Wimbledon than World Cup gaga
709,"06/07/18, 2:07:42 PM",Sush, *haha
710,"06/07/18, 2:12:12 PM",Sush, I feel like an honorary Mormon sometimes üòÖ
711,"06/07/18, 2:25:58 PM",Nikhil, Ah ok. I‚Äôm in a sports bar watching Brazil Belgium
712,"06/07/18, 2:26:41 PM",Sush, Fun!
713,"06/07/18, 2:26:48 PM",Sush, I just walked to campus to read
714,"06/07/18, 3:07:28 PM",Nikhil, Belgium!
715,"11/07/18, 9:58:58 AM",Sush, hi‚Äô
716,"11/07/18, 9:59:03 AM",Sush, *hi!
717,"11/07/18, 10:03:26 AM",Nikhil, Hey 
718,"11/07/18, 10:04:12 AM",Sush, How was week 1 post promotion?
719,"11/07/18, 10:04:48 AM",Nikhil, It‚Äôs not actually a promotion 
720,"11/07/18, 10:05:30 AM",Nikhil," It just means I take on the manager role for this study. If I do a few more and everyone says I‚Äôm a good manager, then I get the official designation as a manager (and associated salary bump)"
721,"11/07/18, 10:05:39 AM",Sush, Ohh okay!
722,"11/07/18, 10:06:04 AM",Sush, Did you like it?
723,"11/07/18, 10:06:09 AM",Nikhil, If I wimp out and go do another study as an associate instead then it wouldn‚Äôt count. Need to make sure that doesn‚Äôt happen
724,"11/07/18, 10:06:16 AM",Nikhil," So, I got a bit screwed!"
725,"11/07/18, 10:06:32 AM",Nikhil, The office is super busy right now and there‚Äôs very few consultants available.
726,"11/07/18, 10:07:02 AM",Nikhil, I staffed this one girl but the staffing manager came and made a fuss about how she should do client facing work and not research work (which is what I‚Äôm doing)
727,"11/07/18, 10:07:35 AM",Nikhil, So I didn‚Äôt get anyone else this week and they‚Äôre still struggling to find me someone good for the next 3 weeks
728,"11/07/18, 10:07:46 AM",Sush, ayy that‚Äôs v annoying
729,"11/07/18, 10:08:21 AM",Sush, So that means you‚Äôre doing it all by yourself?
730,"11/07/18, 10:08:28 AM",Nikhil, For now yes
731,"11/07/18, 10:09:32 AM",Nikhil," Btw, in other exciting/scary/weird news... we bought an apartment"
732,"11/07/18, 10:09:40 AM",Nikhil, Or are in the process of buying one
733,"11/07/18, 10:10:16 AM",Sush, Ooh congratulations!! That‚Äôs so exciting!
734,"11/07/18, 10:10:20 AM",Sush, Where?
735,"11/07/18, 10:11:09 AM",Nikhil," In Dubai, on a new development they‚Äôre doing, which includes their version of the London Eye and stuff."
736,"11/07/18, 10:11:26 AM",Sush, How fancy!
737,"11/07/18, 10:11:37 AM",Nikhil, Lol
738,"11/07/18, 10:11:56 AM",Sush, Wait you‚Äôre not 30 yet no?
739,"11/07/18, 10:12:05 AM",Sush, So that is v cool!
740,"11/07/18, 10:12:08 AM",Nikhil, Almost!
741,"11/07/18, 10:12:18 AM",Sush, You‚Äôll turn 30 this year?
742,"11/07/18, 10:12:36 AM",Nikhil," I mean, I‚Äôm getting help from family so not really as cool as you may be thinking"
743,"11/07/18, 10:12:37 AM",Nikhil, Yeah
744,"11/07/18, 10:12:58 AM",Sush, Still pretty cool 
745,"11/07/18, 10:13:36 AM",Sush, I‚Äôm starting to get bored üòÖ
746,"11/07/18, 10:13:48 AM",Sush, I wish I could go to India!
747,"11/07/18, 10:14:03 AM",Sush, but it‚Äôs also great to just bum around in Chicago for a while
748,"11/07/18, 10:14:18 AM",Sush, Esp if I have to leave it üò¢
749,"11/07/18, 10:18:01 AM",Nikhil, Where are the places you‚Äôre applying to?
750,"11/07/18, 10:18:28 AM",Sush," here, new york, sf"
751,"28/07/18, 2:02:45 AM",Nikhil, Hello
752,"28/07/18, 8:41:02 AM",Sush, Hii!
753,"28/07/18, 9:31:28 AM",Nikhil, How‚Äôs it going?
754,"28/07/18, 9:33:27 AM",Sush, It‚Äôs going alright I guess!
755,"28/07/18, 9:33:48 AM",Sush," Some days are fun, some days are anxiety inducing"
756,"28/07/18, 10:28:27 AM",Sush, how are you?
757,"28/07/18, 10:29:24 AM",Nikhil," I‚Äôm good... went for a spin class type of thing, now getting dinner"
758,"28/07/18, 10:30:03 AM",Sush, ooh how was that?
759,"28/07/18, 10:30:10 AM",Sush, my cousin is obsessed
760,"28/07/18, 10:30:31 AM",Nikhil, Ok but a bit underwhelmed
761,"28/07/18, 10:31:00 AM",Sush, ah 
762,"28/07/18, 10:31:08 AM",Sush, i haven't worked out in nearly a month -_-
763,"28/07/18, 10:31:16 AM",Sush, mostly meeting my 10k steps
764,"28/07/18, 10:31:21 AM",Sush, but nothing beyond
765,"28/07/18, 10:31:34 AM",Nikhil," I have, but i‚Äôve been drinking and am generally fat as hell"
766,"28/07/18, 10:31:44 AM",Nikhil, 10k is good!
767,"28/07/18, 10:31:58 AM",Sush, ooh i didn't drink for 5 months and i think it helped!
768,"28/07/18, 10:32:09 AM",Sush, last month was no ice-cream month 
769,"28/07/18, 10:32:19 AM",Sush, this month is no fried food month lol
770,"28/07/18, 10:32:26 AM",Sush, so obvi i can't STOP eating ice-cream now
771,"28/07/18, 10:32:37 AM",Nikhil, This feels plenty healthy!
772,"28/07/18, 10:33:11 AM",Sush, i think even just not drinking beer helps!
773,"28/07/18, 10:33:24 AM",Sush, but it's a lot easier to do that in college
774,"28/07/18, 10:33:31 AM",Nikhil, I don‚Äôt drink much beer but do drink wine
775,"28/07/18, 10:33:48 AM",Nikhil, And anyway I think the absolute quantity was the issue 
776,"28/07/18, 10:33:58 AM",Sush, hahaha fair
777,"28/07/18, 10:34:22 AM",Sush, i think i also gravitate towards sweet wines
778,"28/07/18, 10:34:40 AM",Sush, my wine tastes are like a 16 y old white girl
779,"28/07/18, 10:34:50 AM",Nikhil, Lol
780,"30/07/18, 2:19:15 AM",Sush, I can‚Äôt sleeeeep
781,"30/07/18, 2:48:27 AM",Nikhil, What‚Äôs on your mind? 
782,"01/08/18, 8:57:30 PM",Sush," partly this job stuff, which is turning out way more hard / random than i'd hoped"
783,"01/08/18, 9:05:44 PM",Sush, i've also been pretty indecisive and probably even a bit lackadaisical in my pursuit
784,"01/08/18, 9:06:01 PM",Sush, but i'm growing so tired of it
785,"01/08/18, 11:33:59 PM",Nikhil, I know 
786,"01/08/18, 11:34:18 PM",Nikhil," I mean, I had exactly the same feelings during b school"
787,"01/08/18, 11:34:47 PM",Nikhil, Could never figure out why I wasn‚Äôt getting stuff I wanted when others did
788,"01/08/18, 11:34:53 PM",Sush," it's kinda different though because much like after insti for me, i'm on this path that doesn't exist yet "
789,"01/08/18, 11:35:13 PM",Nikhil, True
790,"01/08/18, 11:35:18 PM",Sush, right?! i definitely don't feel _dumber_
791,"01/08/18, 11:35:36 PM",Nikhil, Haha exactly
792,"01/08/18, 11:35:47 PM",Sush, i had a great interview last week at this lab at northwestern
793,"01/08/18, 11:35:57 PM",Sush, and i loved the professor and he loved me too!
794,"01/08/18, 11:36:15 PM",Sush, but turns out they cant use my STEM extension and seem reluctant to do h1-b
795,"01/08/18, 11:36:23 PM",Nikhil, Hmm
796,"01/08/18, 11:36:29 PM",Sush, i'm v v frustrated and disappointed at that
797,"01/08/18, 11:36:41 PM",Nikhil, I‚Äôm sorry 
798,"01/08/18, 11:36:41 PM",Sush, because being the right person for the job isn't even enough!
799,"01/08/18, 11:36:53 PM",Nikhil, Yeah the visa thing really sucks
800,"01/08/18, 11:37:24 PM",Sush, idk if i'm going overboard with only looking for jobs where i'll learn a lot
801,"01/08/18, 11:37:58 PM",Sush," but i'm young and i can make decisions not driven by $ now, no?"
802,"01/08/18, 11:38:06 PM",Nikhil, Of course
803,"01/08/18, 11:38:10 PM",Sush, don't i have the rest of my life to do that?
804,"01/08/18, 11:38:17 PM",Sush, i really want to learn lots and NOT BE BORED
805,"01/08/18, 11:38:29 PM",Sush, maybe i'm being unrealistic about this also idk 
806,"01/08/18, 11:38:52 PM",Sush, sorry i'm ranting but i'm so annoyed and mostly confused!
807,"01/08/18, 11:39:28 PM",Sush, i'm going to sound awfully spoiled and privilege-blind now but i'll go ahead
808,"01/08/18, 11:39:45 PM",Sush, i feel like i never get things unless i have _total despair_ before i get it
809,"01/08/18, 11:40:25 PM",Sush, and i'm doing a decent job of staying upbeat and happy now - so does this mean i won't get it?!
810,"01/08/18, 11:40:39 PM",Nikhil," I don‚Äôt think you need to worry about money all that much, but I will say that since this is a new field, mostly, you will probably find something interesting for a short while in a lot of jobs, and all jobs tend to get, you know, boring and tedious in large patches"
811,"01/08/18, 11:41:25 PM",Sush, this is true
812,"01/08/18, 11:41:44 PM",Nikhil, I feel like this is a bit of a personal heuristic for you that mostly substitutes for how hard you‚Äôre looking/working?
813,"01/08/18, 11:42:19 PM",Nikhil, (Or would be for me)
814,"01/08/18, 11:42:34 PM",Sush, i have two interviews going on now and another early conversation idk
815,"01/08/18, 11:42:49 PM",Sush, like i'm being slow and steady about it probably
816,"01/08/18, 11:42:58 PM",Sush, it doesn't help that mine isn't a professional degree
817,"01/08/18, 11:43:28 PM",Sush, and also this is absurd and not that important
818,"01/08/18, 11:43:39 PM",Sush, but i keep wondering if other people think i'm a TOTAL LOSER lol
819,"01/08/18, 11:46:00 PM",Nikhil, Er
820,"01/08/18, 11:46:03 PM",Nikhil, Why? 
821,"01/08/18, 11:46:40 PM",Sush, becauseeee i graduated almost 2 months ago and i'm still job hunting
822,"01/08/18, 11:47:04 PM",Sush, and i hate when people ask 12323231242149 questions at parties and stuff
823,"01/08/18, 11:47:15 PM",Sush," what are you looking for, why don't you try this"
824,"01/08/18, 11:47:23 PM",Sush, HUSH I NEVER ASKED U
825,"01/08/18, 11:47:47 PM",Nikhil, I know 
826,"01/08/18, 11:48:01 PM",Sush, so annoying i know all of this is totally petty
827,"01/08/18, 11:48:13 PM",Sush, and i'm laughing a bit at myself now but ü§¨ü§¨
828,"01/08/18, 11:48:28 PM",Nikhil," I mean, I totally have a tendency to give unwanted advice, but yeah, I know how annoying that can get"
829,"01/08/18, 11:48:43 PM",Sush, i didn't mean you at all!
830,"01/08/18, 11:48:52 PM",Sush, i mean total RANDOS
831,"01/08/18, 11:49:10 PM",Sush, i texted you halfway across the world to talk about it lol
832,"01/08/18, 11:49:29 PM",Nikhil," No no, I got that "
833,"01/08/18, 11:49:41 PM",Sush, ok good 
834,"01/08/18, 11:50:12 PM",Nikhil," All I can say is, this whole process is annoying for everyone"
835,"01/08/18, 11:50:20 PM",Sush, true
836,"01/08/18, 11:50:27 PM",Sush, and it _will_ suck until it doesn't anymore
837,"01/08/18, 11:50:35 PM",Nikhil," And it‚Äôs hard not to take it personally, especially if you have peers who have managed to work things out"
838,"01/08/18, 11:50:36 PM",Nikhil, Yeah
839,"01/08/18, 11:50:59 PM",Nikhil," And there IS a fair amount of randomness to this, I think"
840,"01/08/18, 11:51:07 PM",Sush," yes! of my 4 close friends in the cohort, 2 have found jobs, 1 has a phd admit and the fourth is still finishing his thesis"
841,"01/08/18, 11:51:51 PM",Sush, the guy who's still working on this thesis is not worried AT ALL lol - he's barely started job hunting and he's so confident he thinks i'm nuts
842,"01/08/18, 11:52:37 PM",Sush, the northwestern professor even read my thesis!
843,"01/08/18, 11:53:11 PM",Sush, it was incredibly exciting and gratifying to have a person who isn't my adviser read my thesis and like it üò≠
844,"01/08/18, 11:55:14 PM",Nikhil, üòä
845,"01/08/18, 11:57:01 PM",Sush, how are you? üòÖ
846,"01/08/18, 11:57:26 PM",Nikhil," Good, but getting ready to get to work "
847,"01/08/18, 11:57:49 PM",Sush, =)
848,"01/08/18, 11:57:59 PM",Sush, i should've asked if it was a good time before going off 
849,"02/08/18, 12:01:23 AM",Nikhil," Lol, I was lazing around anyway"
850,"03/08/18, 3:11:57 AM",Nikhil, I‚Äôm deeply confused about what to do for my break
851,"03/08/18, 3:12:17 AM",Nikhil, I can‚Äôt get anyone to come with me for the music festival I wanted to go to and I‚Äôm not sure I should go alone 
852,"03/08/18, 9:05:15 AM",Sush, Come to America üëØüëØ
853,"03/08/18, 10:35:21 AM",Nikhil," Too far, no visa"
854,"03/08/18, 10:36:05 AM",Sush, Faiirrr
855,"03/08/18, 10:37:37 AM",Nikhil," Anyway, I bought tickets and booked everything today, finally"
856,"03/08/18, 10:37:48 AM",Nikhil, Turns out like4 other people from the office are going
857,"03/08/18, 10:38:04 AM",Nikhil, Two of whom I know and 2 I don‚Äôt really know
858,"03/08/18, 10:38:52 AM",Nikhil," I kind of had to force myself into their group and of course I‚Äôm still not really going ‚Äúwith‚Äù them, but at least I can probably hang out with them for a while "
859,"03/08/18, 10:39:15 AM",Sush, üòÇ where‚Äôs the festival ?
860,"03/08/18, 10:39:22 AM",Nikhil, Does his sort of thing happen with you? It does with me and then I feel like a bit of a loser
861,"03/08/18, 10:39:38 AM",Nikhil, https
862,"03/08/18, 10:39:45 AM",Nikhil, Pretty awesome lineup 
863,"03/08/18, 10:40:01 AM",Sush, I am a lazy piece of shit and seldom leave my neighbourhood
864,"03/08/18, 10:40:26 AM",Sush, but it totally happens! annoying when your real friends don‚Äôt want to do the same stuff as you!
865,"03/08/18, 10:40:56 AM",Nikhil," Or can‚Äôt, etc, but then I find out how shallow my friends circle actually is"
866,"03/08/18, 10:41:19 AM",Sush, And also dispersed no?
867,"03/08/18, 10:41:28 AM",Nikhil, Yeah true
868,"03/08/18, 10:41:32 AM",Sush, Like literally scattered across the world
869,"10/08/18, 9:30:04 PM",Sush, Hello!
870,"11/08/18, 2:14:33 AM",Nikhil, Hey 
871,"18/08/18, 7:42:09 AM",Sush, Hope your families are ok!
872,"18/08/18, 10:08:49 AM",Nikhil," Hey, yeah, immediate family is all safe"
873,"18/08/18, 10:09:03 AM",Nikhil, I was supposed to fly in yesterday
874,"18/08/18, 10:09:16 AM",Nikhil, Still planning to go on 22nd.
875,"18/08/18, 10:49:23 AM",Sush," Oh, good!"
876,"18/08/18, 10:49:41 AM",Sush, Hope things are better by then!
877,"18/08/18, 11:12:39 AM",Nikhil, Yeah hopefully 
878,"18/08/18, 11:12:43 AM",Nikhil, How are you doing?
879,"18/08/18, 11:21:31 AM",Sush, I‚Äôm doing okay!
880,"18/08/18, 11:22:04 AM",Nikhil, How‚Äôs interviewing?
881,"18/08/18, 11:22:10 AM",Sush, It‚Äôs weird lol - I‚Äôm having a good time bumming around but there‚Äôs a hum of anxiety in the background that‚Äôs growing steadily louder
882,"18/08/18, 11:22:37 AM",Sush, Literally the same since the last time we talked
883,"18/08/18, 11:30:45 AM",Nikhil," Well, I‚Äôm sure something will convert soon "
884,"18/08/18, 11:30:51 AM",Nikhil," Chin up, etc"
885,"18/08/18, 11:31:33 AM",Sush, üòä
886,"18/08/18, 11:31:37 AM",Sush, Inshallah!
887,"18/08/18, 11:31:51 AM",Sush, I just remembered you read the hillbilly elegy recently too
888,"18/08/18, 11:31:58 AM",Sush, I finished it a week or so ago
889,"18/08/18, 11:32:02 AM",Sush, What did you think?
890,"18/08/18, 11:32:36 AM",Nikhil, Oh yes - I believe I saw on goodreads that you weren‚Äôt too impressed 
891,"18/08/18, 11:33:10 AM",Sush, It just annoyed me so much at the endüòÖ it was a good read until then as like a personal story
892,"18/08/18, 11:33:17 AM",Nikhil," I honestly liked it, and it was a very good portrait into a class that I just don‚Äôt have any real interaction with, but didn‚Äôt think it was some seminal book."
893,"18/08/18, 11:33:31 AM",Nikhil, The end being the more prescriptive bits? I honestly forgot most of that
894,"18/08/18, 11:33:55 AM",Sush, Agree - the attempts to elevate that story into like policy lessons were so misguided
895,"18/08/18, 11:34:34 AM",Nikhil, I don‚Äôt know that I recall any of the specific policy bits anyway.
896,"18/08/18, 11:34:39 AM",Sush," also the glorification of some violence, no?"
897,"18/08/18, 11:34:45 AM",Nikhil, Hmm?
898,"18/08/18, 11:35:07 AM",Sush, Like his grandmother threatening to kill people and beating them up etc
899,"18/08/18, 11:35:19 AM",Sush, Somehow we‚Äôre supposed to that as heroic
900,"18/08/18, 11:35:58 AM",Sush, Tbf I probably liked it 3 stars rather than 2
901,"18/08/18, 11:37:02 AM",Nikhil," Ah. I don‚Äôt know if it was glorified, per se, but I was in any case not opposed to the idea that problems have different solutions in different contexts."
902,"18/08/18, 11:37:24 AM",Sush, Fair
903,"18/08/18, 11:37:44 AM",Nikhil, And honestly it didn‚Äôt seem that a governmental solution would have been a great idea
904,"18/08/18, 11:38:06 AM",Sush," I also chafed a bit at the glorification of ‚Äòintact‚Äô families - in a lot of contexts an increasing divorce rate would mean more agency, more freedom, more safety"
905,"18/08/18, 11:38:28 AM",Nikhil, True
906,"18/08/18, 11:38:51 AM",Nikhil, I think a lot of people automatically assume that an ‚Äúintact‚Äù family is intact a functional family
907,"18/08/18, 11:38:56 AM",Nikhil, * in fact
908,"18/08/18, 11:39:18 AM",Sush, True - but that‚Äôs probably a small ish fraction of families that stay together
909,"18/08/18, 11:39:46 AM",Nikhil, Is it?
910,"18/08/18, 11:40:03 AM",Nikhil," I mean, I don‚Äôt know, honestly."
911,"18/08/18, 11:40:35 AM",Sush, Yeah I don‚Äôt _know_ either
912,"18/08/18, 11:40:54 AM",Sush, I wish the book had remained a memoir
913,"18/08/18, 11:41:24 AM",Sush, the detours into prescriptive policy stuff annoyed me
914,"18/08/18, 11:41:42 AM",Sush, Like Educated - it doesn‚Äôt make grander claims
915,"18/08/18, 11:42:05 AM",Nikhil, Which is Educated?
916,"18/08/18, 11:42:24 AM",Sush, the memoir of a Mormon woman from Idaho
917,"18/08/18, 11:42:48 AM",Sush, From this survivalist family that didn‚Äôt believe in schooling or hospitals or any institutionalised
918,"18/08/18, 11:43:17 AM",Nikhil, Ah interesting
919,"28/08/18, 7:08:15 PM",Sush, Hiii
920,"28/08/18, 7:16:34 PM",Nikhil, Hey üòä
921,"28/08/18, 7:16:53 PM",Nikhil, I‚Äôm just boarding a flight to Delhi and then onwards to Paris
922,"28/08/18, 7:17:07 PM",Nikhil, Where I‚Äôll be cycling the Loire valley for a week by myself
923,"28/08/18, 7:17:21 PM",Nikhil, A decision most people have found inexplicable
924,"28/08/18, 7:17:29 PM",Nikhil, What are you up to?
925,"28/08/18, 7:18:30 PM",Sush, that sounds nice!!
926,"28/08/18, 7:18:44 PM",Sush, I got ANOTHER last round reject just now
927,"28/08/18, 7:18:46 PM",Sush, from Lyft
928,"28/08/18, 7:18:53 PM",Nikhil, Ouch 
929,"28/08/18, 7:19:00 PM",Sush, yeahhhhh
930,"28/08/18, 7:19:05 PM",Nikhil, Do they give feedback/explanations?
931,"28/08/18, 7:19:12 PM",Sush, they flew me out for 4 back to back interviews that nearly killed me
932,"28/08/18, 7:19:24 PM",Sush, apparently i wasn't sufficiently well-versed with the PRODUCT
933,"28/08/18, 7:19:31 PM",Nikhil, Huh
934,"28/08/18, 7:19:38 PM",Sush," like, trade-offs making decisions etc"
935,"28/08/18, 7:19:43 PM",Sush," which is fair, i guess?"
936,"28/08/18, 7:19:50 PM",Sush," but like, idk, that stuff is so easily learned"
937,"28/08/18, 7:20:02 PM",Nikhil, Yeah exactly
938,"28/08/18, 7:20:10 PM",Sush, there was no ML / data sci in the interviews also which was odd
939,"28/08/18, 7:20:22 PM",Sush, it was like probability and causal inference which i thought went well
940,"28/08/18, 7:20:30 PM",Sush, but i guess i have no business sense or something?
941,"28/08/18, 7:20:40 PM",Sush, but idk that seems like the easiest thing to learn on the job
942,"28/08/18, 7:20:52 PM",Sush, esp with like specific details
943,"28/08/18, 7:21:31 PM",Sush, am i just a GIANT loser?!
944,"28/08/18, 7:21:50 PM",Sush, with a large flashing neon L on my forehead
945,"28/08/18, 7:22:19 PM",Sush, probably visible from SPACE
946,"28/08/18, 7:22:27 PM",Nikhil, More likely they just found someone who did marginally better with things that a couple of those interviewers thought were more important 
947,"28/08/18, 7:22:45 PM",Sush," no, it's the giant flashing L"
948,"28/08/18, 7:23:08 PM",Sush," at least i'm hot, i guess?"
949,"28/08/18, 7:23:14 PM",Sush, ish
950,"28/08/18, 7:23:15 PM",Sush, lol
951,"28/08/18, 7:23:16 PM",Nikhil, Haha
952,"28/08/18, 7:23:38 PM",Sush, some dude wanted to get me a drink RIGHT THEN after i left the lyft office
953,"28/08/18, 7:24:09 PM",Sush, i was so annoyed couldn't even aggressively tell him off in case he worked for lyft
954,"28/08/18, 7:24:11 PM",Nikhil, Some dude at Lyft? I hope not one of the guys who just interviewed you 
955,"28/08/18, 7:24:19 PM",Nikhil, Lol
956,"28/08/18, 7:24:23 PM",Sush, not one of the people who interviewed me!
957,"28/08/18, 7:24:24 PM",Nikhil, Why not?
958,"28/08/18, 7:24:33 PM",Sush, i was also just stumped lol
959,"28/08/18, 7:24:40 PM",Sush, 4 back to back technical interviews
960,"28/08/18, 7:24:49 PM",Sush, no behavioural questions at all!
961,"28/08/18, 7:24:53 PM",Sush, like not a one
962,"28/08/18, 7:25:30 PM",Sush, i was too disoriented to think beyond ' don't be aggressive maybe he works at lyft and knows you just interviewed there'
963,"28/08/18, 7:26:41 PM",Nikhil, Ah ok
964,"28/08/18, 7:27:00 PM",Nikhil, So are you back in Chicago now or still in... is lyft in sf?
965,"28/08/18, 7:27:10 PM",Sush, i'm back in chicago now
966,"28/08/18, 7:27:16 PM",Sush, i got back on sunday
967,"28/08/18, 7:27:24 PM",Sush," it is in sf, yeah"
968,"28/08/18, 7:30:15 PM",Sush," i mean, i went knowing it was a long shot"
969,"28/08/18, 7:30:24 PM",Nikhil," Ah, but did you just hear from them now?"
970,"28/08/18, 7:30:28 PM",Sush, but after the interviews i was like ok i was pretty good
971,"28/08/18, 7:30:31 PM",Sush, yeah i just did
972,"28/08/18, 7:30:35 PM",Sush, a few hours ago
973,"28/08/18, 7:30:51 PM",Sush, i even did math on a whiteboard!
974,"28/08/18, 7:30:59 PM",Sush," which is you know, KIND OF a big deal for me?"
975,"28/08/18, 7:31:07 PM",Nikhil, Always a power move üòÜ
976,"28/08/18, 7:31:16 PM",Sush, i mean they wanted me to 
977,"28/08/18, 7:31:43 PM",Sush, it's so hard also for me to feel more confident with this stuff after years of being HS in insti lol
978,"28/08/18, 7:32:04 PM",Sush, i struggle to feel well-qualified sometimes around people who've been doing this forever
979,"28/08/18, 7:32:16 PM",Sush, did i tell you about the northwestern lab?
980,"28/08/18, 7:32:31 PM",Nikhil, The one with the visa issues?
981,"28/08/18, 7:32:37 PM",Sush, yeah
982,"28/08/18, 7:32:50 PM",Sush, apparently they might have figured it out
983,"28/08/18, 7:32:58 PM",Nikhil, Really!
984,"28/08/18, 7:33:01 PM",Sush, they emailed today talking about moving forward and how they hope i'll join
985,"28/08/18, 7:33:14 PM",Sush, i'm like why are you hoping man just give me a damn offer rn
986,"28/08/18, 7:33:15 PM",Nikhil, That‚Äôs good!
987,"28/08/18, 7:33:26 PM",Sush, so idk!
988,"28/08/18, 7:33:32 PM",Nikhil, Lol true
989,"28/08/18, 7:33:34 PM",Sush, i really like the professor and the lab and i know i'll learn loads
990,"28/08/18, 7:33:44 PM",Sush, but it probably pays VERY little haha
991,"28/08/18, 7:33:55 PM",Sush, but i guess it'll give me time to find what i want?
992,"28/08/18, 7:34:15 PM",Sush, ugh should i have just done econ consulting?
993,"28/08/18, 7:34:18 PM",Sush, but SO BORING
994,"28/08/18, 7:34:44 PM",Nikhil," Yeah, and I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôll pay *enough* even if it‚Äôs not as much as you would have made elsewhere"
995,"28/08/18, 7:35:03 PM",Sush, true! it'll definitely be enough for a comfortable life in chicago
996,"28/08/18, 7:35:16 PM",Nikhil," Where enough covers, you know, middle class urban living with student loans"
997,"28/08/18, 7:35:25 PM",Sush, yeah
998,"28/08/18, 7:35:41 PM",Nikhil, And you don‚Äôt exactly need to be maximizing earning potential just yet from what I understand
999,"28/08/18, 7:35:49 PM",Nikhil, Push them to work it out!
1000,"28/08/18, 7:35:52 PM",Sush, true
1001,"28/08/18, 7:35:59 PM",Sush, yeah the professor seems v keen
1002,"28/08/18, 7:36:07 PM",Sush, and seems like he's pushing HR
1003,"28/08/18, 7:36:10 PM",Sush, which is good
1004,"28/08/18, 7:36:56 PM",Nikhil, I‚Äôd still keep interviewing just because you can‚Äôt always tell with these things
1005,"28/08/18, 7:37:15 PM",Sush, ugh ya i have zero optimism for anything
1006,"28/08/18, 7:37:22 PM",Nikhil, But at least you have something to think about 
1007,"28/08/18, 7:37:33 PM",Nikhil, My flight is about to take off
1008,"28/08/18, 7:37:45 PM",Nikhil, I haven‚Äôt slept at all tonight and it‚Äôs 6 AM
1009,"28/08/18, 7:38:05 PM",Sush, ayy paavam!
1010,"28/08/18, 7:38:09 PM",Sush, have a safe flight
1011,"28/08/18, 7:38:11 PM",Nikhil, Haha
1012,"28/08/18, 7:38:21 PM",Nikhil, Thanks. Gn!
1013,"02/09/18, 4:48:29 PM",Sush, How‚Äôs your trip??
1014,"03/09/18, 3:11:58 AM",Nikhil, Good!
1015,"03/09/18, 3:12:04 AM",Nikhil," Tiring, somewhat"
1016,"03/09/18, 3:12:45 AM",Nikhil," Today and tomorrow are long rides - tomorrow‚Äôs a 50k round trip which I may skip, this couple who are on this with me said they‚Äôll probably just taxi it "
1017,"03/09/18, 3:12:50 AM",Nikhil, How are you doing?
1018,"04/09/18, 10:17:39 PM",Sush, whoa
1019,"04/09/18, 10:17:45 PM",Sush, did you end up doing it? 
1020,"05/09/18, 2:02:20 AM",Nikhil," No, glad I didn‚Äôt - was feeling a bit sick. Did a 15k look to another castle instead"
1021,"05/09/18, 8:40:50 AM",Sush, Fun!
1022,"05/09/18, 8:41:28 AM",Sush, I have somehow been talked into trying a Pilates class at 9 am across town
1023,"05/09/18, 8:41:36 AM",Sush, Regretting this already
1024,"05/09/18, 12:03:34 PM",Nikhil," How far is ‚Äúacross town‚Äù, exactly?"
1025,"05/09/18, 12:28:17 PM",Sush, Like a bus and a train away
1026,"05/09/18, 12:28:21 PM",Sush, 16 miles
1027,"05/09/18, 1:43:41 PM",Nikhil," Yeah, that seems entirely too far"
1028,"05/09/18, 1:44:07 PM",Nikhil, Chicago should have more than one pilates class every 16 miles?
1029,"05/09/18, 9:03:28 PM",Sush, lol yaaa but we had plans after
1030,"29/10/18, 11:18:11 PM",Nikhil, Happy birthday!
1031,"29/10/18, 11:42:28 PM",Sush, Thank you!!
1032,"29/10/18, 11:42:39 PM",Nikhil, Been a while 
1033,"29/10/18, 11:42:43 PM",Nikhil, How are you?
1034,"29/10/18, 11:42:44 PM",Sush, A v v Belated HBD to you too!!
1035,"29/10/18, 11:42:51 PM",Nikhil, Haha thanks 
1036,"29/10/18, 11:42:54 PM",Sush, I‚Äôm sorry I missed it ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
1037,"29/10/18, 11:42:58 PM",Sush, I‚Äôm good!!
1038,"29/10/18, 11:43:03 PM",Sush, I just cleaned my house!
1039,"29/10/18, 11:43:11 PM",Nikhil, Lol
1040,"29/10/18, 11:43:23 PM",Sush, haha yesss 
1041,"29/10/18, 11:43:35 PM",Sush, I‚Äôm having myself a little birthday party this year
1042,"29/10/18, 11:43:58 PM",Sush, on Saturday. It‚Äôs going to be birthday + Diwali in my new apartment!
1043,"29/10/18, 11:44:15 PM",Nikhil, Ooh nice
1044,"29/10/18, 11:44:22 PM",Nikhil, You moved? Where to?
1045,"29/10/18, 11:44:30 PM",Sush, to the north side of chicago!
1046,"29/10/18, 11:44:47 PM",Sush, oh wait we haven't talked in FOREVER
1047,"29/10/18, 11:44:56 PM",Sush, i joined the lab at Northwestern I was telling you about!
1048,"29/10/18, 11:45:01 PM",Sush, It's been about a month now
1049,"29/10/18, 11:46:06 PM",Nikhil, Haha yes. I didn‚Äôt want to ask because I didn‚Äôt know how it was going. But congrats! That‚Äôs awesome! üéäüéâ
1050,"29/10/18, 11:47:12 PM",Sush, haha i'm actually glad ‚ù§ i HATED everyone who asked when it wasn't going well 
1051,"29/10/18, 11:47:19 PM",Sush, it's been nice so far!
1052,"29/10/18, 11:47:25 PM",Sush, how are youuu?
1053,"29/10/18, 11:47:40 PM",Nikhil," Ah, I‚Äôm ok"
1054,"29/10/18, 11:48:03 PM",Nikhil, Work is going alright although I had a bad couple of weeks in between
1055,"29/10/18, 11:48:29 PM",Sush," ayy, what happened?"
1056,"29/10/18, 11:48:33 PM",Nikhil, Life in general is also ok but some definite ups and downs 
1057,"29/10/18, 11:49:02 PM",Nikhil," Work? I got pushed onto a project in a role I didn‚Äôt want, and then I didn‚Äôt do it very well for a while"
1058,"29/10/18, 11:49:27 PM",Nikhil," I mea, partly I didn‚Äôt do it very well, partly other people freaked out so that even the small issues became big issues"
1059,"29/10/18, 11:49:44 PM",Sush, that sounds annoying
1060,"29/10/18, 11:50:24 PM",Nikhil," Fixed it in the end, but one bad outcome is that i don‚Äôt think at least some of the partners involved think all that highly of me, which may be an issue at some point."
1061,"29/10/18, 11:51:29 PM",Sush, hopefully there'll remember more recent successes when the time comes!
1062,"29/10/18, 11:51:58 PM",Nikhil, So one hopes 
1063,"29/10/18, 11:54:04 PM",Nikhil," How‚Äôs the new job, though? Is the work what you expected? People nice?"
1064,"29/10/18, 11:54:24 PM",Sush, there's not MANY people haha
1065,"29/10/18, 11:54:38 PM",Sush," it's more solitary than i'd hoped, but i like the work a lot so far"
1066,"29/10/18, 11:55:00 PM",Sush, i'm already learning new stuff and there's room for me to actually dive deep etc which i appreciate
1067,"29/10/18, 11:55:10 PM",Sush, i like the prof who leads the lab a LOT
1068,"29/10/18, 11:55:12 PM",Sush, he's great
1069,"29/10/18, 11:55:46 PM",Nikhil, Nice 
1070,"29/10/18, 11:55:57 PM",Sush, it actually is for now
1071,"29/10/18, 11:56:26 PM",Sush, it's extendable to 3 years on this grant
1072,"29/10/18, 11:56:38 PM",Sush, assuming my OPT extension works out ok
1073,"29/10/18, 11:56:46 PM",Nikhil, Oh nice
1074,"29/10/18, 11:57:36 PM",Nikhil," Yeah, you keep hearing news on visas that i‚Äôve basically blocked out, but I‚Äôm assuming the opt extension is straightforward enough"
1075,"29/10/18, 11:57:55 PM",Sush, yeah i hope so
1076,"29/10/18, 11:58:03 PM",Sush, there's some restrictions as to the type of employer
1077,"29/10/18, 11:58:15 PM",Sush," but we'll see - i don't super want to think about that till like, jan "
1078,"30/10/18, 12:00:06 AM",Nikhil, 
1079,"30/10/18, 12:07:35 AM",Sush, ok HBD 2 me in chicago haha
1080,"30/10/18, 12:07:46 AM",Sush, now i'm feeling slightly lame for doing NOTHING tonight 
1081,"30/10/18, 12:09:25 AM",Nikhil, Haha I didn‚Äôt realize. Happy birthday again!
1082,"30/10/18, 12:09:42 AM",Nikhil, I did nothing for my birthday either which I thought I was fine with but did in fact feel bad about
1083,"30/10/18, 12:10:54 AM",Sush, i'm going to a jazz bar with some close friends tomorrow
1084,"30/10/18, 12:11:04 AM",Sush, and i'm having a slightly extra party on saturday
1085,"30/10/18, 12:11:22 AM",Sush, i'm feeling more obligated to DO something than actually desirous of it 
1086,"30/10/18, 12:11:43 AM",Sush, had you not wanted to do anything?
1087,"30/10/18, 12:14:14 AM",Nikhil," I mean, not too badly, and Mia was feeling a bit down so we decided to make it a quiet weekend, just went out for lunch/drinks. Which was nice I guess "
1088,"30/10/18, 12:15:17 AM",Nikhil," I do kind of wish I‚Äôd had, not a big blowout party but time with friends and stuff"
1089,"30/10/18, 12:15:27 AM",Sush, that's fair!
1090,"30/10/18, 12:15:43 AM",Sush, it's a good excuse for people to come together i guess
1091,"02/11/18, 11:36:17 PM",Sush, You wouldn‚Äôt be in Dubai around Christmas no?
1092,"03/11/18, 3:58:54 AM",Nikhil, Haven‚Äôt booked tickets but don‚Äôt think so
1093,"09/12/18, 3:22:59 PM",Sush, Hello!
1094,"10/12/18, 3:42:22 AM",Nikhil, Hey 
1095,"10/12/18, 3:42:29 AM",Nikhil, How are you?
1096,"10/12/18, 11:17:32 AM",Sush, hi hi 
1097,"10/12/18, 11:17:36 AM",Sush, I'm good! You?
1098,"10/12/18, 8:20:55 PM",Nikhil, I‚Äôm alright
1099,"10/12/18, 8:21:03 PM",Nikhil, Fairly annoyed with work
1100,"10/12/18, 8:21:17 PM",Nikhil," Not because it‚Äôs tough, but reviews and everything"
1101,"10/12/18, 8:21:47 PM",Nikhil," Starting a new study today which is likely to be super intense, but at least I get a week for Christmas"
1102,"16/12/18, 2:53:55 PM",Sush, hello hello!
1103,"16/12/18, 2:54:19 PM",Sush, has your week off begun? 
1104,"16/12/18, 2:54:22 PM",Sush, going home?
1105,"17/12/18, 3:14:46 AM",Nikhil," Not yet, next week "
1106,"17/12/18, 3:15:12 AM",Nikhil, How about you?
1107,"18/12/18, 12:34:54 PM",Sush, Next week too!
1108,"18/12/18, 12:35:01 PM",Sush, I'm actually leaving *on* Christmas
1109,"18/12/18, 1:03:46 PM",Nikhil, Ah ok
1110,"18/12/18, 1:03:59 PM",Sush, can't wait!
1111,"18/12/18, 1:04:02 PM",Sush, it's been a whole year
1112,"18/12/18, 1:04:14 PM",Nikhil, I was hoping to fly out tomorrow but it looks like I‚Äôll be here till late on Thursday/Friday morning üò¢
1113,"18/12/18, 1:04:24 PM",Sush, oh no 
1114,"18/12/18, 1:04:30 PM",Sush, i'm already soooooo impatient to leave
1115,"18/12/18, 1:04:36 PM",Sush, everything's winding down
1116,"18/12/18, 1:04:41 PM",Nikhil, Me too
1117,"18/12/18, 1:04:53 PM",Sush, has Mia already left?
1118,"18/12/18, 1:05:06 PM",Nikhil, I‚Äôm... finding my job much more of a chore these days
1119,"18/12/18, 1:05:21 PM",Nikhil, No we still leave together from Dubai on Friday night
1120,"18/12/18, 1:05:27 PM",Sush," you're 2 years in now, no?"
1121,"18/12/18, 1:05:29 PM",Nikhil, But I was hoping to get to Dubai tomorrow
1122,"18/12/18, 1:05:33 PM",Nikhil, Yeah
1123,"18/12/18, 1:05:35 PM",Sush, ah okay! where are you now?
1124,"18/12/18, 1:05:39 PM",Nikhil, Riyadh
1125,"18/12/18, 1:05:47 PM",Sush, aaah okay
1126,"18/12/18, 1:06:41 PM",Sush, not liking the project youre on?
1127,"18/12/18, 1:06:51 PM",Nikhil, No it‚Äôs not the project per se
1128,"18/12/18, 1:07:09 PM",Nikhil, I had a bad review so that‚Äôs one big reason if I‚Äôm being honest
1129,"18/12/18, 1:07:27 PM",Nikhil, But it‚Äôs also just about not finding this particularly exciting
1130,"18/12/18, 1:07:47 PM",Nikhil, And maybe a little bit being afraid of stepping up to be a manager which I‚Äôm on the cusp of now
1131,"18/12/18, 1:08:12 PM",Sush, fair fair...bad in what way?
1132,"18/12/18, 1:08:27 PM",Sush, do you think you'll enjoy being manager?
1133,"18/12/18, 1:09:19 PM",Nikhil," The partners thought I sucked at the basic role on the last study I did, actually. Never got that before. Still don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs reflective and I don‚Äôt think I did that badly, but üòæ"
1134,"18/12/18, 1:10:02 PM",Sush," that sucks, i'm sorry!"
1135,"18/12/18, 1:11:40 PM",Nikhil, Yeah. I‚Äôm doing ok on this project but one thing i‚Äôve found is that I‚Äôm actually also much LAZIER/ less inclined to go all out now
1136,"18/12/18, 1:13:54 PM",Sush, circumstance-driven or are you just bored at the job?
1137,"18/12/18, 1:21:47 PM",Nikhil, I‚Äôm a bit worried it‚Äôs just a character flaw 
1138,"18/12/18, 1:22:04 PM",Sush, I HEAR YOU lol
1139,"18/12/18, 1:22:09 PM",Sush," if it is, i have it as well"
1140,"18/12/18, 1:23:21 PM",Sush, i'm _already_ like er should i just get that phd
1141,"18/12/18, 1:23:40 PM",Nikhil, Haha I think about that but then feel like it‚Äôll be worse!
1142,"18/12/18, 1:23:59 PM",Sush," but then idk - at school, your life starts over every term "
1143,"18/12/18, 1:24:10 PM",Sush, real life doesnt give us that!
1144,"18/12/18, 1:24:24 PM",Nikhil, But not for a PhD no? That‚Äôs a pretty long term project
1145,"18/12/18, 1:24:29 PM",Sush, that's also true
1146,"18/12/18, 1:29:22 PM",Nikhil," Also - I‚Äôm a bit worried that I am either not as smart as I thought I was, or maybe actually getting *dumber*?"
1147,"18/12/18, 1:29:41 PM",Sush, latter is v v possible i think?
1148,"18/12/18, 1:30:12 PM",Sush, but it's probably a function of interest!
1149,"18/12/18, 1:30:13 PM",Nikhil," Yeah? I mean, yes, but... WHY?"
1150,"18/12/18, 1:30:59 PM",Sush, we're on autopilot more often - flex certain muscles less?
1151,"18/12/18, 1:32:47 PM",Nikhil, Yeah possible
1152,"18/12/18, 1:33:38 PM",Nikhil, I still READ a lot but although I‚Äôm in a ‚Äúcognitive‚Äù job it‚Äôs really a lot of basic shit and not a lot of DOING different things beyond PowerPoint or some excel
1153,"18/12/18, 1:34:13 PM",Sush, fair...i have barely read anything in the last 3 months 
1154,"18/12/18, 1:34:58 PM",Nikhil," Most of the book length reading is fiction, it‚Äôs just blogs for the other stuff, and most of that is just ‚Äúfun‚Äù as well"
1155,"18/12/18, 1:36:41 PM",Sush, I just bought a book out of guilt lol
1156,"18/12/18, 1:37:09 PM",Sush," i mean, i was listening to a podcast that talked about it this morning, so i was planning on looking it up anyway"
1157,"18/12/18, 1:37:21 PM",Nikhil, Which?
1158,"18/12/18, 1:37:25 PM",Sush, Wildfire
1159,"18/12/18, 1:37:49 PM",Sush, paul dano made it into a movie and he was talking about the book on a podcast
1160,"18/12/18, 1:38:04 PM",Sush, related - you have to watch the war and peace miniseries!
1161,"18/12/18, 1:38:32 PM",Nikhil, Yeah?
1162,"18/12/18, 1:38:44 PM",Sush, yes it's very very good
1163,"18/12/18, 1:39:08 PM",Sush, three of my friends and i watched it together last year
1164,"18/12/18, 1:50:23 PM",Nikhil," Ok, maybe it can be holiday watching"
1165,"18/12/18, 1:50:29 PM",Nikhil, I found the book a bit of a chore
1166,"18/12/18, 1:51:33 PM",Sush, the show is soooo good
1167,"18/12/18, 1:51:40 PM",Sush, Only 6 episodes
1168,"18/12/18, 1:52:35 PM",Nikhil, And I had a bit of a thing for lily James 
1169,"18/12/18, 1:52:47 PM",Nikhil, She looks very different in different photos
1170,"18/12/18, 1:54:00 PM",Nikhil, By the way did I already recommend a scribd subscription?
1171,"18/12/18, 1:54:10 PM",Nikhil, If I could get it on my kindle I would be SO happy
1172,"18/12/18, 1:54:19 PM",Nikhil, They have a really good selection
1173,"18/12/18, 1:59:46 PM",Sush, She‚Äôs so üòçüòç
1174,"18/12/18, 1:59:51 PM",Sush, What‚Äôs scribd?
1175,"18/12/18, 2:00:11 PM",Sush, I quite Chicago public library - syncs nicely with kindle
1176,"18/12/18, 2:02:48 PM",Nikhil," Scribd is basically like Netflix for books - kind of like kindle unlimited, but kindle unlimited has like 5 best sellers and thousands of Amazon authors who make very specific genre fiction"
1177,"18/12/18, 2:03:43 PM",Nikhil," It‚Äôs 10$ a month and has tons of audiobooks as well, if you‚Äôre into that - has wild fire as an audio book, but not unfortunately as a regular book"
1178,"18/12/18, 2:15:11 PM",Sush, Ooh will check it out
1179,"18/12/18, 2:15:32 PM",Sush, I‚Äôm not into audiobooks yet but I feel like that‚Äôs something I could easily take to
1180,"18/12/18, 2:27:30 PM",Nikhil, I usually find that it‚Äôs too slow
1181,"18/12/18, 2:28:15 PM",Sush," it's irritating to rewind also, no?"
1182,"18/12/18, 2:28:16 PM",Nikhil," And I drift off much more easily - I skim up and down the page when I read every so often anyway, but with audiobooks obviously that‚Äôs not feasible"
1183,"18/12/18, 2:28:20 PM",Nikhil, Exactly
1184,"18/12/18, 2:28:23 PM",Sush, if you get distracted or fall asleep
1185,"18/12/18, 2:28:24 PM",Sush, yeahh
1186,"18/12/18, 2:28:51 PM",Sush, i started doing a coursera class because that's how bored i am -_-
1187,"18/12/18, 4:56:58 PM",Nikhil, Which one?
1188,"18/12/18, 5:48:14 PM",Sush, applied social network analysis
1189,"01/01/19, 7:31:11 PM",Sush, HNY!
1190,"02/01/19, 1:10:42 AM",Nikhil, Happy New Year!
1191,"02/01/19, 1:33:18 AM",Sush, Thankyouuu
1192,"02/01/19, 1:33:22 AM",Sush, How are you??
1193,"02/01/19, 5:38:56 AM",Nikhil, I‚Äôm good 
1194,"22/01/19, 4:48:13 PM",Sush, I waaas
1195,"22/01/19, 4:48:18 PM",Sush, Back in Chicago now
1196,"31/01/19, 1:43:49 PM",Nikhil, How cold are you?
1197,"31/01/19, 2:20:20 PM",Sush, Frozen
1198,"31/01/19, 2:20:30 PM",Sush, See my insta!
1199,"31/01/19, 2:31:34 PM",Nikhil, I did 
1200,"31/01/19, 2:31:42 PM",Nikhil, What are you up to?
1201,"31/01/19, 2:32:33 PM",Sush, I‚Äôm at the Doctor‚Äôs
1202,"31/01/19, 2:32:41 PM",Sush, My freaking neck has been killing me
1203,"31/01/19, 2:32:51 PM",Sush, I have early onset old age
1204,"31/01/19, 2:32:56 PM",Nikhil, What happened?
1205,"31/01/19, 2:33:21 PM",Sush, I had a compression in my spine a couple of years ago that caused a lot of pain
1206,"31/01/19, 2:33:29 PM",Sush, And it went away with a lot of massage and rest
1207,"31/01/19, 2:33:35 PM",Sush, Now it‚Äôs flared up again
1208,"31/01/19, 2:33:47 PM",Sush, And I think I pulled something in my right shoulder on my flight back
1209,"31/01/19, 2:33:48 PM",Nikhil, Ouch
1210,"31/01/19, 2:34:03 PM",Sush, It‚Äôs so painful I don‚Äôt sleep thru the night
1211,"31/01/19, 2:34:12 PM",Sush, Only time it doesn‚Äôt hurt is when I walk!
1212,"31/01/19, 2:34:21 PM",Sush, And the weather isn‚Äôt conducive to that lol
1213,"31/01/19, 2:34:32 PM",Nikhil, I‚Äôm not sleeping through the night these days either but I think it‚Äôs just sleep apnea and stress
1214,"31/01/19, 2:47:54 PM",Sush, That sucks! Do you have the machine thingy for that?
1215,"31/01/19, 2:51:23 PM",Nikhil," Not actually sleep apnea as much as just stress, I think"
1216,"31/01/19, 2:51:51 PM",Sush, Work stress?
1217,"31/01/19, 2:53:03 PM",Nikhil, Yes. Or just work related negativity I guess
1218,"31/01/19, 2:54:29 PM",Nikhil, How‚Äôs work for you? Do you have to go in when it‚Äôs this cold?
1219,"31/01/19, 4:11:33 PM",Sush, Sorry doctor showed up
1220,"31/01/19, 4:11:40 PM",Sush, I didn‚Äôt have to go the last two days!
1221,"31/01/19, 4:11:55 PM",Sush, Yesterday it was dangerous to be out for more than five mins!
1222,"02/02/19, 2:57:47 PM",Sush, Hello hello!
1223,"[02/02/19, 2:58:01 PM",Sush, ‚Äéimage omitted
1224,"22/03/19, 1:04:13 PM",Sush, Hello!
1225,"22/03/19, 1:24:51 PM",Nikhil, Hello!
1226,"22/03/19, 1:25:05 PM",Nikhil," I was thinking of you, like, this morning!"
1227,"22/03/19, 1:25:13 PM",Nikhil, How‚Äôs it going?
1228,"22/03/19, 1:25:30 PM",Sush, Hii! 
1229,"22/03/19, 1:25:38 PM",Sush, Not bad! how are youuu
1230,"22/03/19, 1:25:53 PM",Nikhil, üôÇ
1231,"22/03/19, 1:25:55 PM",Nikhil, I‚Äôm ok
1232,"22/03/19, 1:26:17 PM",Nikhil, Work is tough
1233,"22/03/19, 1:26:26 PM",Nikhil, Life‚Äôs going on as usual
1234,"22/03/19, 1:26:44 PM",Nikhil, Should move in to my new place soon
1235,"22/03/19, 1:26:53 PM",Sush, Samesies. I'm a little dissatisfied at work and spring is taking too long to spring
1236,"22/03/19, 1:27:09 PM",Nikhil," Weirdly enough, here too!"
1237,"22/03/19, 1:27:21 PM",Sush, Not too hot yet?
1238,"22/03/19, 1:27:29 PM",Nikhil, Like it‚Äôs not BAD weather but it‚Äôs mildly cold even now
1239,"22/03/19, 1:27:38 PM",Sush, weird!
1240,"22/03/19, 1:27:47 PM",Sush, it's like -1 this evening and it's almost april
1241,"22/03/19, 1:27:48 PM",Sush, -_-
1242,"22/03/19, 1:28:11 PM",Sush, at least the sun's popping out now and then though
1243,"22/03/19, 1:28:21 PM",Nikhil," Yeah I meant more like, 20 üòõ"
1244,"22/03/19, 1:28:27 PM",Sush, hahaha
1245,"22/03/19, 1:28:56 PM",Sush, need. more. seratonin.!
1246,"22/03/19, 1:29:51 PM",Nikhil, 
1247,"22/03/19, 1:30:05 PM",Sush, 
1248,"22/03/19, 1:30:09 PM",Nikhil, How are things otherwise? What‚Äôs with the work dissatisfaction?
1249,"22/03/19, 1:30:32 PM",Sush, It's fiiine only - like i'm the first data science person on this team
1250,"22/03/19, 1:30:45 PM",Sush, so i end up doing a bunch of project management
1251,"22/03/19, 1:30:50 PM",Sush, which i don't really care for
1252,"22/03/19, 1:30:57 PM",Nikhil, Hmm
1253,"22/03/19, 1:31:12 PM",Sush, and i want to learn from people who know this well lol
1254,"22/03/19, 1:31:51 PM",Nikhil," I mean, most jobs are a lot more ‚Äúprocess‚Äù than ‚Äúcontent‚Äù (this is work lingo but I think the terms are fairly useful) anyway"
1255,"22/03/19, 1:32:04 PM",Sush, i guess that's true 
1256,"22/03/19, 1:32:13 PM",Sush, it's SO DULL though
1257,"22/03/19, 1:32:37 PM",Nikhil, But yeah it‚Äôs annoying if you have literally no one who can show you how to grow on what you really want to learn
1258,"22/03/19, 1:33:00 PM",Sush, yeah! i'm also 99% sure now that i'm not applying to a phd
1259,"22/03/19, 1:33:09 PM",Sush, so the pay cut doesn't make sense in that context
1260,"22/03/19, 1:33:44 PM",Nikhil, Pay cut?
1261,"22/03/19, 1:34:00 PM",Sush, like this job vs industry
1262,"22/03/19, 1:35:07 PM",Sush, there are some things in this job that'll improve my chances of moving into DS in tech tho
1263,"22/03/19, 1:35:24 PM",Nikhil, Ah right
1264,"22/03/19, 1:35:25 PM",Sush, so i should probably be patient and get those skills
1265,"22/03/19, 1:35:56 PM",Nikhil, I‚Äôm sure the experience is useful in any case
1266,"22/03/19, 1:36:07 PM",Sush, yeah that it is
1267,"22/03/19, 1:36:13 PM",Nikhil," It was only for 1 year, right?"
1268,"22/03/19, 1:36:18 PM",Sush, 2 years
1269,"22/03/19, 1:37:41 PM",Nikhil, Ah ok. Do you think you‚Äôd want to leave sooner than that?
1270,"22/03/19, 1:37:47 PM",Sush, i think so!
1271,"22/03/19, 1:37:57 PM",Sush, maybe after i get my STEM extension paperwork done
1272,"22/03/19, 1:38:01 PM",Sush, like 1.5 years
1273,"22/03/19, 1:39:59 PM",Sush, how's Mia?
1274,"22/03/19, 1:42:22 PM",Nikhil, So another year or so?
1275,"22/03/19, 1:42:55 PM",Nikhil," She‚Äôs good, she‚Äôs working with her dad now"
1276,"22/03/19, 1:43:13 PM",Sush, oh nice! in dubai itself?
1277,"22/03/19, 1:51:41 PM",Nikhil, Yeah
1278,"22/03/19, 1:53:57 PM",Sush, She likes it?
1279,"22/03/19, 1:54:05 PM",Sush, are you guys enjoying living in dubai?
1280,"22/03/19, 3:40:27 PM",Nikhil," Well, she‚Äôs learning a lot "
1281,"22/03/19, 3:41:00 PM",Nikhil," We are, but mostly in the sense that we can‚Äôt point to anything identifiable to complain about"
1282,"22/03/19, 3:46:14 PM",Sush, haha is that what happiness in adulthood means üòÖ
1283,"22/03/19, 3:48:06 PM",Nikhil, Lol
1284,"22/03/19, 3:48:15 PM",Nikhil, Are you still enjoying Chicago?
1285,"22/03/19, 3:48:25 PM",Sush, i am 
1286,"22/03/19, 3:48:31 PM",Sush, i'm VERY ready for spring though
1287,"22/03/19, 3:48:39 PM",Nikhil," I think I did actually enjoy Dubai, at some point, but am in a more uneasy state now in general"
1288,"22/03/19, 3:49:10 PM",Sush, fair!
1289,"22/03/19, 3:49:29 PM",Sush, the thing i dont love about chicago is just how materially the weather impacts your life
1290,"22/03/19, 3:49:36 PM",Sush, seasonal affective disorder is so damn real
1291,"22/03/19, 3:50:07 PM",Sush, why is work being annoying?
1292,"22/03/19, 3:51:34 PM",Nikhil," I think I mentioned at some point how I didn‚Äôt do so well on one study and they said, ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre ready to be a manager yet‚Äù?"
1293,"22/03/19, 3:52:18 PM",Nikhil, Which was especially annoying because I‚Äôd already been a manager on one study so was fully ready to step up
1294,"22/03/19, 3:52:29 PM",Nikhil," Anyway, that was like 5 months ago"
1295,"22/03/19, 3:53:39 PM",Nikhil," Then I did another study as an associate and that went ok but they still said, ‚Äúmaybe do one more as a senior associate and take on more responsibility and show you can do stuff before being solely responsible for a project‚Äù"
1296,"22/03/19, 3:53:45 PM",Nikhil, Which is probably fair
1297,"22/03/19, 3:54:04 PM",Sush, you're bored with the associate role?
1298,"22/03/19, 4:02:55 PM",Nikhil, It‚Äôs more that it‚Äôs time to move on for me
1299,"22/03/19, 4:03:08 PM",Nikhil," I mean, I‚Äôm above the average tenure and hitting close to the max"
1300,"22/03/19, 4:03:15 PM",Nikhil, For staying as an associate
1301,"22/03/19, 4:03:24 PM",Nikhil, And it IS an up or out culture
1302,"22/03/19, 4:03:37 PM",Nikhil, So at some point I‚Äôll have to either make it or leave
1303,"22/03/19, 4:04:01 PM",Nikhil," I mean, they probably won‚Äôt fire me for a while, but just from a social perspective at work it‚Äôll feel awful"
1304,"22/03/19, 4:04:39 PM",Nikhil, The worry is also that I think they may be RIGHT ie I don‚Äôt in fact have the basic skills/organization needed to deliver a whole project
1305,"22/03/19, 4:04:46 PM",Nikhil, Which is a doubt I never had before
1306,"22/03/19, 4:05:03 PM",Nikhil, And I think the confidence boost is making this a self fulfilling prophecy
1307,"22/03/19, 4:10:52 PM",Sush, ayy that doesn't sound fun! i hear you - it's hard to tell what signals other people are picking up on also
1308,"02/04/19, 1:58:49 PM",Sush, hello
1309,"02/04/19, 1:58:55 PM",Sush, I have married person question
1310,"02/04/19, 1:59:24 PM",Sush, üòÇ
1311,"02/04/19, 1:59:26 PM",Nikhil, Hmm? üòä
1312,"02/04/19, 1:59:48 PM",Nikhil, Just getting home so answer but may only reply in a bit 
1313,"02/04/19, 1:59:57 PM",Sush, I‚Äôve been getting along with someone who fairly tangentially works with us
1314,"02/04/19, 2:00:02 PM",Nikhil, *ask
1315,"02/04/19, 2:00:04 PM",Sush, Ok no worries I‚Äôll just explain haha
1316,"02/04/19, 2:00:18 PM",Sush, And he‚Äôs married
1317,"02/04/19, 2:00:43 PM",Sush, And to be completely honest I do find him kind of attractive and I think he‚Äôs slightly into me?
1318,"02/04/19, 2:01:15 PM",Sush, but I have zero intentions of acting on anything obviously - I would never hit on a married person
1319,"02/04/19, 2:05:20 PM",Sush, we got coffee once - he had some econometrics questions and we ended up talking for several hours
1320,"02/04/19, 2:21:12 PM",Nikhil, Ok...
1321,"02/04/19, 2:21:19 PM",Nikhil, So what‚Äôs the question? 
1322,"02/04/19, 2:24:19 PM",Sush, we got lunch the other day
1323,"02/04/19, 2:24:31 PM",Sush, and he's asking if i want to get dinner now
1324,"02/04/19, 2:24:39 PM",Sush, is that sketchy?
1325,"02/04/19, 2:24:42 PM",Sush, lol
1326,"02/04/19, 2:24:51 PM",Nikhil, Aha
1327,"02/04/19, 2:24:56 PM",Nikhil, Er
1328,"02/04/19, 2:25:02 PM",Sush, i've expressed interest in meeting his wife at least twice
1329,"02/04/19, 2:25:06 PM",Nikhil, Lol
1330,"02/04/19, 2:25:13 PM",Nikhil, Does he bring her up?
1331,"02/04/19, 2:25:29 PM",Sush," he does, so that makes me feel more comfortable"
1332,"02/04/19, 2:27:30 PM",Nikhil," I was going to say that that likely signifies he doesn‚Äôt *intend* to cheat on his wife, whether or not he‚Äôs into you"
1333,"02/04/19, 2:29:07 PM",Nikhil, Do you in fact want to get dinner with him?
1334,"02/04/19, 2:29:47 PM",Sush, I do I think
1335,"02/04/19, 2:30:07 PM",Sush, I mean I wouldn‚Äôt have thought twice about if he wasn‚Äôt married
1336,"02/04/19, 2:30:32 PM",Sush, getting dinner I mean
1337,"02/04/19, 2:30:53 PM",Sush, I‚Äôm p sure I‚Äôd also just have made friends with him if he hadn‚Äôt been married
1338,"02/04/19, 2:31:53 PM",Sush, It‚Äôs just - I know I won‚Äôt be involved in someone cheating on their wife
1339,"02/04/19, 2:32:08 PM",Sush, beyond that it‚Äôs not my problem to think about his married-ness no?
1340,"02/04/19, 2:32:14 PM",Sush, It‚Äôs his problem or not
1341,"02/04/19, 2:32:18 PM",Nikhil, Exactly
1342,"02/04/19, 2:35:25 PM",Sush, A friend of mine made me feel v awkward about this lol
1343,"02/04/19, 2:35:34 PM",Sush, Like it‚Äôs something illicit!
1344,"02/04/19, 2:36:41 PM",Nikhil, Ah 
1345,"02/04/19, 2:37:41 PM",Sush, So I thought I‚Äôll ask you haha
1346,"02/04/19, 2:37:54 PM",Nikhil, I‚Äôm not sure I have that much special insight üòõ
1347,"02/04/19, 2:37:56 PM",Sush, as one of my married male friends
1348,"02/04/19, 2:38:28 PM",Sush, but that probably means it‚Äôs not a THING
1349,"02/04/19, 2:38:40 PM",Sush, which I think is what I wanted to hear
1350,"02/04/19, 2:39:15 PM",Nikhil," Well, my point was more that you don‚Äôt need to worry about it as long as you know what you want"
1351,"02/04/19, 2:40:08 PM",Sush, yeah true
1352,"02/04/19, 2:42:03 PM",Nikhil," Being married does not make you immune from having, shall we say, ‚Äúcrushes‚Äù, as childish as that seems, or even from trying to spend time with people you like all the way to the edge of creepiness; but I assume that for most people it puts a pretty big barrier to acting on them in a substantive way."
1353,"02/04/19, 2:42:54 PM",Nikhil," If that IS the case it may not be that comfortable for you at some point, but again, no reason to believe that‚Äôs necessarily happening from what you mentioned"
1354,"02/04/19, 2:43:16 PM",Sush, v true
1355,"02/04/19, 2:43:36 PM",Sush, Ok I‚Äôm just going to peace out then
1356,"02/04/19, 2:43:46 PM",Nikhil, üëçüòä
1357,"02/04/19, 2:44:10 PM",Sush, My alarm bells go off very easily with men anyway so I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll pick up on something fairly quick
1358,"03/04/19, 9:52:20 AM",Sush, ‚ÄéYou deleted this message.
1359,"03/04/19, 9:52:52 AM",Sush, ‚ÄéYou deleted this message.
1360,"03/04/19, 9:57:14 AM",Nikhil, Two deleted messages! What‚Äôs up? 
1361,"03/04/19, 9:59:42 AM",Sush, hahaha noo
1362,"03/04/19, 9:59:50 AM",Sush, so i was wrong about this situation
1363,"03/04/19, 9:59:57 AM",Sush, or maybe not wrong
1364,"03/04/19, 10:00:09 AM",Nikhil, Hmm?
1365,"03/04/19, 10:00:10 AM",Nikhil, Tell me
1366,"03/04/19, 10:00:50 AM",Sush, so we went to dinner last night
1367,"03/04/19, 10:01:18 AM",Sush, and then he was like i shouldnt say this but im starting to like you
1368,"03/04/19, 10:01:31 AM",Sush, i was like er ya you shouldn't say it!
1369,"03/04/19, 10:01:41 AM",Nikhil, Aha
1370,"03/04/19, 10:01:52 AM",Sush, this is disillusioning!
1371,"03/04/19, 10:02:00 AM",Sush, i don't want to get married if people are going to do this!
1372,"03/04/19, 10:02:30 AM",Nikhil, Lol
1373,"03/04/19, 10:02:37 AM",Nikhil, So how strong was it?
1374,"03/04/19, 10:02:41 AM",Nikhil, And how early?
1375,"03/04/19, 10:02:46 AM",Nikhil, And how awkward did it get?
1376,"03/04/19, 10:02:56 AM",Sush, i'm not entirely sure tbh
1377,"03/04/19, 10:03:02 AM",Sush, i think they got married like 2 years ago
1378,"03/04/19, 10:03:05 AM",Sush, not even that long
1379,"03/04/19, 10:03:10 AM",Sush, went to undergrad together
1380,"03/04/19, 10:04:53 AM",Sush, i feel bad and complicit?
1381,"03/04/19, 10:05:14 AM",Sush, but it's also not MY problem!
1382,"03/04/19, 10:05:39 AM",Sush, i did get the sense that this wasn't maybe his first time attempting to do this?
1383,"03/04/19, 10:05:53 AM",Sush, he didn't seem particularly tortured about it or anything lol
1384,"03/04/19, 10:07:01 AM",Nikhil," Ah. So less ‚Äúmy heart is tearing me in 2 different directions, I can‚Äôt tear myself away from you‚Äù and more ‚Äúhey I‚Äôd like to be with you‚Äù?"
1385,"03/04/19, 10:10:20 AM",Sush, yeah kind of
1386,"03/04/19, 10:10:27 AM",Sush, his rhetoric was of the former variety
1387,"03/04/19, 10:10:32 AM",Sush, but it sounded too easy to say lol
1388,"03/04/19, 10:10:53 AM",Nikhil, Lol
1389,"03/04/19, 10:11:18 AM",Sush, and like MY heart isn't being pulled in any direction
1390,"03/04/19, 10:11:32 AM",Nikhil, üòÅ
1391,"03/04/19, 10:11:57 AM",Nikhil," On a more general note, are solo dinners with male friends really a thing for you?"
1392,"03/04/19, 10:12:24 AM",Sush," usually, i wouldn't think twice about it"
1393,"03/04/19, 10:12:32 AM",Sush, i was thinking about my friend uday
1394,"03/04/19, 10:12:36 AM",Nikhil, Yeah?
1395,"03/04/19, 10:12:39 AM",Sush, we hang out alone a lot
1396,"03/04/19, 10:12:47 AM",Sush, and i've never thought about it
1397,"03/04/19, 10:13:46 AM",Sush, i was second-guessing this because *i* found him attractive i think
1398,"03/04/19, 10:14:19 AM",Sush, or even my friend rodrigo - rodrigo and uday have both been at my house alone with me till like 1 am / 2 am and there's been zero awkwardness about it
1399,"03/04/19, 10:14:45 AM",Sush, with rodrigo it's often been studying but also just like watching a movie
1400,"03/04/19, 10:16:02 AM",Nikhil, Ok
1401,"03/04/19, 10:16:13 AM",Sush, is it a thing for you?
1402,"03/04/19, 10:16:30 AM",Sush, and by 'thing' do you mean common or NOT common?
1403,"03/04/19, 10:16:37 AM",Sush, like thing vs Thing
1404,"03/04/19, 10:18:27 AM",Nikhil," Not any more, no "
1405,"03/04/19, 10:18:35 AM",Nikhil, By thing I meant common
1406,"03/04/19, 10:18:42 AM",Nikhil, Not thing as in is this an issue 
1407,"03/04/19, 10:18:49 AM",Sush, ah okay!
1408,"03/04/19, 10:18:56 AM",Sush, yeah rodrigo and uday are both single
1409,"03/04/19, 10:19:03 AM",Sush, i guess that's a factor
1410,"03/04/19, 10:19:05 AM",Nikhil, Partly I just don‚Äôt have that many people I hang out with at all now
1411,"03/04/19, 10:19:26 AM",Nikhil, So - just polled my colleague on this who‚Äôs sitting next to me üòõ
1412,"03/04/19, 10:19:43 AM",Sush, hahaha do tell
1413,"03/04/19, 10:19:47 AM",Nikhil, She was also like yeah I used to have a lot of guy friends and it‚Äôs never weird
1414,"03/04/19, 10:20:09 AM",Nikhil," But then also admitted that typically, somebody will end up having feelings of some sort for somebody"
1415,"03/04/19, 10:20:14 AM",Nikhil, Which was my hypothesis
1416,"03/04/19, 10:20:59 AM",Sush, interesting
1417,"03/04/19, 10:21:27 AM",Sush," i feel like with anyone i've dated, i've known within ten minutes of meeting them that it was going there"
1418,"03/04/19, 10:26:29 AM",Nikhil, From what i‚Äôve gathered you‚Äôve actually been pretty good at knowing what you want.
1419,"03/04/19, 10:27:01 AM",Sush, i think so too! i wasn't friends with anyone i dated before i dated them
1420,"03/04/19, 10:27:39 AM",Sush," speaking of, i'm going to siddharth's wedding next month!"
1421,"03/04/19, 12:07:15 PM",Nikhil, Ooh
1422,"03/04/19, 1:23:11 PM",Nikhil, I‚Äôm bored
1423,"03/04/19, 1:23:17 PM",Nikhil, Mia‚Äôs on her way to Canada
1424,"03/04/19, 1:23:23 PM",Nikhil, I‚Äôm going to have a lonely weekend
1425,"03/04/19, 1:26:46 PM",Sush, ayy!
1426,"03/04/19, 1:26:50 PM",Sush, are any friends around?
1427,"03/04/19, 1:27:18 PM",Nikhil, 
1428,"03/04/19, 1:27:31 PM",Nikhil, You met Jacob at my wedding 
1429,"03/04/19, 1:28:02 PM",Sush, ah yes I did!
1430,"03/04/19, 1:28:40 PM",Sush, it's so annoying when like the 3 people you know are busy/ away over the weekend
1431,"03/04/19, 1:28:49 PM",Nikhil, Lol
1432,"03/04/19, 1:29:01 PM",Sush, i miss college for that lol
1433,"03/04/19, 1:29:42 PM",Nikhil," Scale of 1-10, how happy would you say you are?"
1434,"03/04/19, 1:30:03 PM",Sush, fluctuate between 6 and 7 i think
1435,"03/04/19, 1:30:04 PM",Sush, you?
1436,"03/04/19, 1:30:50 PM",Nikhil, Is 5 neutral or is 0 neutral?
1437,"03/04/19, 1:31:01 PM",Nikhil, Like is 0 sad?
1438,"03/04/19, 1:31:02 PM",Sush, 5 is neutral i think
1439,"03/04/19, 1:31:21 PM",Nikhil, Ok. Maybe like 4.5-6
1440,"03/04/19, 1:31:29 PM",Sush," i guess what i mean to say is - nothing really sucks, but nothing is amazing either"
1441,"03/04/19, 1:31:33 PM",Nikhil, Or 4-6
1442,"03/04/19, 1:31:45 PM",Sush, what do you think keeps that number from being higher?
1443,"03/04/19, 1:32:23 PM",Nikhil," Yeah that‚Äôs kind of what I mean too, just that sometimes I‚Äôm clearly NOT happy, even though I can‚Äôt point to a specific reason why"
1444,"03/04/19, 1:32:32 PM",Nikhil," I mean, I know what my problems are"
1445,"03/04/19, 1:33:01 PM",Nikhil, One is just feeling like I‚Äôm not doing well at work
1446,"03/04/19, 1:33:11 PM",Nikhil, I‚Äôm about 6 months behind
1447,"03/04/19, 1:33:31 PM",Nikhil, One bad review meant I couldn‚Äôt transition to the manager role yet
1448,"03/04/19, 1:33:55 PM",Nikhil, That HAS to happen after the next one but I frankly don‚Äôt know that I‚Äôm impressing the people I‚Äôm working with that much.
1449,"03/04/19, 1:34:32 PM",Sush, that does sound stressful - do you know what specifically they think should be different?
1450,"03/04/19, 1:34:45 PM",Sush," like, are you having trouble *doing* that or caring enough to do it?"
1451,"03/04/19, 1:35:35 PM",Nikhil," Lots of things, actually"
1452,"03/04/19, 1:36:10 PM",Nikhil," One - written communication, my slides aren‚Äôt that good, and to be honest have never been great."
1453,"03/04/19, 1:37:02 PM",Sush, ugh i hear you slides are such a non-intuitive way to communicate
1454,"03/04/19, 1:37:41 PM",Nikhil," Two, and this is surprising and new and I don‚Äôt know why this is happening, verbal communication"
1455,"03/04/19, 1:39:40 PM",Nikhil," Three, most frustrating of all, just process management and initiative. Not the most apparent thing but basically, being too lazy or not doing things on time, especially for things like being proactive about setting up meetings or outsourcing tasks and so on. One of the more important parts of being a manager, I think. Somehow I keep letting things slip. I have no idea why."
1456,"03/04/19, 1:40:28 PM",Sush, You were pretty structured and clear when you just described this! Is it a preparation thing?
1457,"03/04/19, 1:42:48 PM",Sush," I don't know if this is an insti thing, but I've noticed myself and other insti folks do this now - that we don't always prepare ahead because we've always relied on winging it (and usually pull it off successfully)"
1458,"03/04/19, 1:42:56 PM",Nikhil, Yeah I realized that as well 
1459,"03/04/19, 1:43:06 PM",Nikhil, I think that‚Äôs probably part of it
1460,"03/04/19, 1:43:16 PM",Nikhil, I‚Äôve reached the point where I can‚Äôt wing it any more 
1461,"03/04/19, 1:44:17 PM",Sush, i wonder if like talking to a colleague / mia / someone before these things will help - just so you've articulated this stuff before and have something to work off
1462,"03/04/19, 1:44:33 PM",Nikhil, But that just brings up the question of why ‚Äúpreparing‚Äù is so hard/unintuitive for me
1463,"03/04/19, 1:44:58 PM",Nikhil, These things as in meetings and so on?
1464,"03/04/19, 1:45:21 PM",Sush, yeah - not in the sense of actually rehearsing it but just articulating your main ideas
1465,"03/04/19, 1:46:28 PM",Sush," this is so fucking hard for me too - i have two RAs now and idk what the hell to do with them - i'm trying bullet journaling - my PI is really into it. it works great WHEN i actually make a list. but on many days, i can't work up the initiative to *make* that list"
1466,"03/04/19, 1:47:59 PM",Nikhil, Hmm. Would work for major things but this also happens all too often
1467,"03/04/19, 1:48:52 PM",Nikhil, Yeah? I think maybe it‚Äôs just about getting used to it
1468,"03/04/19, 1:51:03 PM",Sush, Fair - you're probably right in that it's a confidence thing - such a vicious circle
1469,"03/04/19, 1:51:25 PM",Sush, Have you tried any of these tracking things?
1470,"03/04/19, 1:52:54 PM",Nikhil, Not properly
1471,"03/04/19, 1:55:41 PM",Sush, might help?
1472,"03/04/19, 1:56:04 PM",Sush, I think the scheduling part of bullet journaling helps me
1473,"03/04/19, 1:56:17 PM",Sush," because if i don't complete a task today, i have to write it down for another day"
1474,"03/04/19, 1:56:33 PM",Sush, so i'm physically writing it twice / as many days as it takes
1475,"03/04/19, 1:56:46 PM",Sush, so it makes for a less ignorable reminder
1476,"03/04/19, 1:58:06 PM",Sush," sorry, i realize i'm being kind of prescriptive and that can be annoying"
1477,"03/04/19, 2:00:42 PM",Nikhil, üòä nah it‚Äôs fine
1478,"03/04/19, 2:01:20 PM",Nikhil, Tasks rarely take more than a couple of days and the way we work we have daily check ins and check outs where we see what we‚Äôve planned to do and done etc
1479,"03/04/19, 2:01:32 PM",Nikhil, Things don‚Äôt usually take more than a day or so
1480,"03/04/19, 2:02:42 PM",Nikhil, The firm is really pretty organized already 
1481,"03/04/19, 2:18:27 PM",Sush, that makes sense!
1482,"03/04/19, 2:18:50 PM",Sush, you probably already have systems in place
1483,"23/04/19, 3:33:32 PM",Sush, How‚Äôs it going?
1484,"23/04/19, 3:51:19 PM",Nikhil, You‚Äôre catching me at precisely the right time to hear another sad rant 
1485,"23/04/19, 3:51:40 PM",Nikhil, If you‚Äôd caught me last week I could have shown a happier face 
1486,"23/04/19, 3:57:46 PM",Sush, Ha!
1487,"23/04/19, 4:00:06 PM",Nikhil, üòä how are you doing?
1488,"23/04/19, 4:00:14 PM",Sush, I'm a little grumpy myself lol
1489,"23/04/19, 4:01:17 PM",Sush, I'm grumpy about work. Are you also grumpy about work?
1490,"23/04/19, 4:01:27 PM",Nikhil, Always 
1491,"23/04/19, 4:01:38 PM",Nikhil, What specifically are you grumpy about?
1492,"23/04/19, 4:01:50 PM",Sush, I'm just BORED
1493,"23/04/19, 4:01:53 PM",Sush, i hate working by myself
1494,"23/04/19, 4:02:03 PM",Sush, busy + BORED is the worst lol
1495,"23/04/19, 4:02:13 PM",Sush, i could slack off if i was just bored
1496,"23/04/19, 4:03:11 PM",Nikhil, Lol true
1497,"23/04/19, 4:03:16 PM",Nikhil, I‚Äôve been there 
1498,"23/04/19, 4:03:17 PM",Sush, i hate these 'non-standard' working environments
1499,"23/04/19, 4:03:22 PM",Sush, i'd just go into academia
1500,"23/04/19, 4:03:42 PM",Sush, my old job was better in terms of being social but also kinda like this
1501,"23/04/19, 4:03:52 PM",Sush, am i too dumb to work at a 'regular' place???
1502,"23/04/19, 4:03:55 PM",Sush, i doubt it??
1503,"23/04/19, 4:04:03 PM",Nikhil, Are you completely standalone? No team at all?
1504,"23/04/19, 4:04:28 PM",Nikhil," Er, I think almost by definition a ‚Äúregular‚Äù place would not require an extraordinary amount of intelligence"
1505,"23/04/19, 4:04:28 PM",Sush, there's one other person but she's a project manager + ethnographer
1506,"23/04/19, 4:05:00 PM",Sush," all i want is 50 + humans, abundant coffee and some sort of requirement to look presentable lol"
1507,"23/04/19, 4:05:30 PM",Sush, (i'm saying this and thinking about the econ consulting gig which had all of this -_-)
1508,"23/04/19, 4:06:05 PM",Nikhil, Which you hated though
1509,"23/04/19, 4:06:16 PM",Sush, I did =/
1510,"23/04/19, 4:06:21 PM",Sush, maybe I'm just a h8er
1511,"23/04/19, 4:06:28 PM",Sush, i don't think so though!
1512,"23/04/19, 4:06:35 PM",Nikhil, Haha
1513,"23/04/19, 4:06:41 PM",Sush, i should've applied to more analyst positions in tech companies
1514,"23/04/19, 4:06:45 PM",Nikhil, I think I actually might just be a hater!
1515,"23/04/19, 4:07:15 PM",Sush, instead of just data scientist positions
1516,"23/04/19, 4:07:19 PM",Sush, yeah?
1517,"23/04/19, 4:08:33 PM",Nikhil," I mean, not in a perpetually unsatisfied way. Just in a ‚Äúdon‚Äôt make me work too hard or I‚Äôll get resentful ‚Äú way. Which is almost the same thing for most ‚Äúgood‚Äù jobs?"
1518,"23/04/19, 4:08:59 PM",Sush, hahaha maybe slightly!
1519,"23/04/19, 4:09:26 PM",Sush, i wish i was a millionaire
1520,"23/04/19, 4:09:41 PM",Sush, i'd just get master's degrees in 20 different things
1521,"23/04/19, 4:09:47 PM",Sush, 40 years done
1522,"23/04/19, 4:09:55 PM",Sush, *masters whatevs
1523,"23/04/19, 4:10:03 PM",Nikhil," I mean, you‚Äôd need way more than a single million"
1524,"23/04/19, 4:10:16 PM",Sush, okay billionaire
1525,"23/04/19, 4:10:41 PM",Nikhil, And also unless you had absolutely no one to answer to you‚Äôll have all this pressure to be ‚Äúsocially‚Äù useful
1526,"23/04/19, 4:11:02 PM",Sush, ugh true
1527,"23/04/19, 4:11:27 PM",Nikhil," I wonder if it would be better if you just won a lottery, or if you actually have to somehow have ‚Äúearned‚Äù the millions for the social pressure to not be there"
1528,"23/04/19, 4:11:40 PM",Sush," i think of some of my friends from high school and they're just sort of chilling? learning something here and there, mostly smoking pot and working out lol"
1529,"23/04/19, 4:12:20 PM",Nikhil," Like I feel like if I had been employee 10 at Facebook or whatever and had made a whole bunch, even if I weren‚Äôt super amazing otherwise, I‚Äôd feel justified to just go around traveling and learning"
1530,"23/04/19, 4:12:27 PM",Sush, hahaha
1531,"23/04/19, 4:12:31 PM",Sush, that sounds p amazing
1532,"23/04/19, 4:12:52 PM",Nikhil, But I‚Äôm not *100%* sure that would apply if I just won it in a lottery. Even if it‚Äôs nearly identical.
1533,"23/04/19, 4:13:10 PM",Nikhil, Ok this is a useless daydream 
1534,"23/04/19, 4:13:25 PM",Sush, yeah üò≠
1535,"23/04/19, 4:13:40 PM",Sush, i miss uchicago!
1536,"23/04/19, 4:13:45 PM",Sush, i was engaged almost everyday!
1537,"23/04/19, 4:14:11 PM",Nikhil, With work or other stuff?
1538,"23/04/19, 4:14:21 PM",Sush, (even if it was anxiety that was keeping me engaged)
1539,"23/04/19, 4:14:35 PM",Sush," a lot with work, which i think really allowed me to enjoy my time off"
1540,"23/04/19, 4:15:08 PM",Nikhil, True
1541,"23/04/19, 4:16:27 PM",Sush, what are you annoyed at?
1542,"23/04/19, 4:16:59 PM",Nikhil, Same old
1543,"23/04/19, 4:17:33 PM",Nikhil, My manager doesn‚Äôt think I‚Äôm quite ready to start leading a team
1544,"23/04/19, 4:18:14 PM",Nikhil," Hopefully he will be a bit more qualified about it when he gives his comments but he‚Äôs not going to give like an unreserved ‚Äúhe‚Äôs great‚Äù, which I kind of need"
1545,"23/04/19, 4:19:22 PM",Nikhil," It‚Äôs annoying because we actually did pretty well on this project, and while his points are all valid to some extent I think a different person may have had a slightly rosier view"
1546,"23/04/19, 4:20:47 PM",Nikhil," And I mentioned this to Mia and she kind of blew up because we had had exactly this conversation before I started on this project and she knows I didn‚Äôt put in the extra effort over the weekends to really wow people and all that, which I had kind of told her I would do."
1547,"23/04/19, 4:21:32 PM",Nikhil," (She‚Äôs a tough love kind of person, which I do *need*, but don‚Äôt necessarily *enjoy*)"
1548,"23/04/19, 4:22:08 PM",Sush," ah, that's fair. in terms of both needing + not enjoying"
1549,"23/04/19, 4:23:10 PM",Sush, i also do appreciate (usually a few days later) when a friend/ family member will actually call me out on something
1550,"23/04/19, 4:23:36 PM",Sush, it probably helps to say out loud what you _didn't_ do for something no? otherwise it's easy for things to just feel unfair
1551,"23/04/19, 4:23:46 PM",Sush, and that makes you feel loss of control
1552,"23/04/19, 4:24:18 PM",Nikhil, Hmm
1553,"23/04/19, 4:24:49 PM",Nikhil," Yes, but for me it‚Äôs also accompanied by frustration about WHY I didn‚Äôt do it"
1554,"23/04/19, 4:25:18 PM",Nikhil," I mean, essentially it‚Äôs just me losing the energy or drive or whatever, I guess. I"
1555,"23/04/19, 4:25:25 PM",Sush, that's fair 
1556,"23/04/19, 4:25:38 PM",Sush, (i'm kinda doing that right now)
1557,"23/04/19, 4:25:49 PM",Sush," more than can't, won't"
1558,"23/04/19, 4:25:57 PM",Nikhil," As Mia put it, I worry about shit a lot but just don‚Äôt do anything about it"
1559,"23/04/19, 4:26:25 PM",Nikhil, There‚Äôs a lot of fear of failure and anxiety and shame all mixed in there
1560,"23/04/19, 4:27:44 PM",Sush," Have you thought about therapy? I've been thinking of going back for precisely some of these things - overwhelming inertia, action paralysis"
1561,"23/04/19, 4:28:41 PM",Sush, I had a neutral - somewhat positive experience with it about 1.5 years ago and wonder if it might help with this
1562,"23/04/19, 4:30:24 PM",Nikhil," I could, but it sure seems like I just need to ‚Äúbuck up‚Äù, etc"
1563,"23/04/19, 4:30:45 PM",Nikhil, I guess I‚Äôm skeptical that I would get all that much out of it
1564,"23/04/19, 4:31:50 PM",Nikhil, Were you seeing a ‚Äútraditional‚Äù therapist or doing something else?
1565,"23/04/19, 4:32:07 PM",Nikhil, I did briefly consider/am considering one of those app things
1566,"23/04/19, 4:32:16 PM",Sush, I was seeing a traditional therapist
1567,"23/04/19, 4:33:20 PM",Sush, it just felt very helpful to talk to someone who didn't have stake in my life
1568,"23/04/19, 4:33:26 PM",Nikhil, Yeah?
1569,"23/04/19, 4:33:49 PM",Sush, i ended up spending a lot of time doing 'cultural translation'
1570,"23/04/19, 4:34:00 PM",Sush, which i think prevented it from being as helpful as it could've been
1571,"23/04/19, 4:34:17 PM",Nikhil, 
1572,"23/04/19, 4:35:13 PM",Sush, i think the most important thing i maybe got out of it was my antidepressant haha
1573,"23/04/19, 4:35:36 PM",Sush, no i'm being facetious
1574,"23/04/19, 4:36:11 PM",Sush, i think it's pretty huge to have a space where you can just say some things out loud and there's no fear of judgement / disappointing someone
1575,"23/04/19, 4:36:49 PM",Sush, i think it helped me be more honest about why i didn't want to do some things
1576,"23/04/19, 4:37:37 PM",Sush, i've also seen it kind of devolve into a blind validation receiving space though
1577,"23/04/19, 4:37:55 PM",Sush, a friend of mine has a therapist that sounds like the most enabling person
1578,"23/04/19, 4:38:20 PM",Sush, either she's not honest with me about what her therapist says (which is fine) or she's not honest with her therapist or her therapist is bad
1579,"23/04/19, 4:39:08 PM",Nikhil, Yeah I guess it probably really depends on the therapist and also how you approach it
1580,"23/04/19, 4:39:27 PM",Sush, Yeah
1581,"23/04/19, 4:39:43 PM",Sush," Like they say the work‚Äôs only ‚Äòplanned‚Äô in therapy, it starts after"
1582,"23/04/19, 4:42:46 PM",Sush, there's also probably some placebo type effect where you're more conscious of some things and get more deliberate about responding to patterns
1583,"23/04/19, 4:42:54 PM",Nikhil, The very word ‚Äúwork‚Äù is making me have an adverse reaction now 
1584,"23/04/19, 4:43:00 PM",Nikhil, Hmm?
1585,"23/04/19, 4:43:06 PM",Sush, ayy sorry 
1586,"23/04/19, 4:43:29 PM",Sush," because you're talking about patterns, you're more attuned to them"
1587,"23/04/19, 4:44:02 PM",Sush, i think it definitely helped me learn to check obsessive thought patterns
1588,"23/04/19, 4:44:27 PM",Sush, i got better and knowing when i was about to spiral and then try and do something about it (usually distract myself)
1589,"23/04/19, 4:45:35 PM",Nikhil, Ah
1590,"23/04/19, 4:46:18 PM",Sush, i hope i haven't put you off the idea haha
1591,"23/04/19, 4:47:47 PM",Nikhil," It wasn‚Äôt really an idea I was considering that strongly, but it‚Äôs still in the running "
1592,"23/04/19, 4:48:37 PM",Sush, 
1593,"23/04/19, 4:51:08 PM",Sush, i'm doing a talk on saturday
1594,"23/04/19, 4:51:14 PM",Sush, and being _terrible_ about preparing for it
1595,"23/04/19, 4:51:22 PM",Sush, i knew it was happening a month  ago
1596,"23/04/19, 4:51:29 PM",Sush, and have basically nothing about it
1597,"23/04/19, 4:51:32 PM",Sush, *done
1598,"23/04/19, 4:51:33 PM",Nikhil, Talk on what?
1599,"23/04/19, 4:51:42 PM",Sush, it's at an R user conference
1600,"23/04/19, 4:51:49 PM",Sush, how to do machine learning with imbalanced classes
1601,"23/04/19, 4:53:01 PM",Nikhil, That sounds interesting and complicated?
1602,"23/04/19, 4:53:16 PM",Sush, it actually is interesting!
1603,"23/04/19, 4:53:21 PM",Sush, it's what i did for my thesis
1604,"23/04/19, 4:53:52 PM",Sush, it makes me nervous to assert authority in this space lol
1605,"23/04/19, 4:54:11 PM",Sush, i'm in the 'statistical methods' session which i think is wild and absurd
1606,"23/04/19, 4:54:22 PM",Nikhil, But presumably if it was your thesis you‚Äôve given some version of this already no? 
1607,"23/04/19, 4:54:43 PM",Sush, yeah! it was mostly focused on the findings though
1608,"23/04/19, 4:54:55 PM",Nikhil, Ah right
1609,"23/04/19, 4:55:04 PM",Sush, i just sort of described why i picked the method i used
1610,"23/04/19, 4:55:11 PM",Sush, rather than go over a bunch of methods
1611,"23/04/19, 4:57:35 PM",Nikhil, So do you need to prep a lot or is this just throwing some slides together?
1612,"23/04/19, 4:57:51 PM",Sush, it needs to be pretty tight
1613,"23/04/19, 4:57:59 PM",Sush, a lot of the chicago data science community will be there
1614,"23/04/19, 4:58:14 PM",Nikhil, Ah
1615,"23/04/19, 4:58:18 PM",Nikhil, Best of luck!
1616,"23/04/19, 4:58:25 PM",Sush, it's a good place to sort of be seen as a smart and competent person haha
1617,"23/04/19, 4:58:41 PM",Sush, i wouldn't want to convey the impression of half-assing it
1618,"23/04/19, 4:58:45 PM",Sush, thank you!
1619,"23/04/19, 4:59:05 PM",Nikhil," Of course, makes sense"
1620,"23/04/19, 4:59:48 PM",Nikhil, How long is it? Is it several talks together or a panel or a full solo session?
1621,"23/04/19, 5:00:03 PM",Sush, so the conference is a day long
1622,"23/04/19, 5:00:20 PM",Sush, the statistical methods session is 4 20-minute talks
1623,"23/04/19, 5:00:42 PM",Nikhil, 20 minutes is pretty long!
1624,"23/04/19, 5:00:49 PM",Sush, no????
1625,"23/04/19, 5:00:51 PM",Sush, i agree
1626,"23/04/19, 5:00:58 PM",Sush, all i've done is make some gifs
1627,"23/04/19, 5:01:06 PM",Nikhil, Lol
1628,"23/04/19, 5:01:38 PM",Sush, to illustrate some methods lol
1629,"23/04/19, 5:01:54 PM",Sush, i love gifs that show like updated learning type things
1630,"23/04/19, 5:02:00 PM",Sush, or just any iterative processes
1631,"23/04/19, 5:02:21 PM",Nikhil, Yeah?
1632,"23/04/19, 5:02:44 PM",Nikhil, Send one
1633,"23/04/19, 5:03:48 PM",Sush, it won't let me send a gif on whatsapp wtf
1634,"23/04/19, 5:06:05 PM",Sush, i just want to feel satisfied when it's done!
1635,"23/04/19, 5:06:16 PM",Sush, and have it be smooth and actually useful to people who listen
1636,"23/04/19, 5:06:50 PM",Nikhil, I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll be good 
1637,"23/04/19, 5:07:04 PM",Nikhil, Did you have time off for Easter?
1638,"23/04/19, 5:07:18 PM",Sush, No 
1639,"23/04/19, 5:07:32 PM",Sush, we didn't even have good friday off which i thought was odd
1640,"23/04/19, 5:07:39 PM",Sush, and didnt at UofC either
1641,"23/04/19, 5:07:44 PM",Sush, inshallah!
1642,"23/04/19, 5:08:35 PM",Nikhil, That is surprising
1643,"23/04/19, 5:09:21 PM",Sush, Did you guys get time off?
1644,"23/04/19, 5:13:10 PM",Nikhil," I took a day since the project was just winding down, but it wasn‚Äôt a public holiday"
1645,"23/04/19, 5:15:50 PM",Nikhil," Ok, I‚Äôm off to bed"
1646,"23/04/19, 5:16:00 PM",Nikhil, Off to sleep I guess since i‚Äôve been in bed for a bit
1647,"26/04/19, 7:55:35 AM",Sush, Last week on the red line- can you move your bag so I can see your tits?
1648,"26/04/19, 7:55:45 AM",Nikhil, Wow
1649,"26/04/19, 7:56:09 AM",Sush, one dude asked me out three times and I said no politely and then asked me to take off my gloves to prove I was married
1650,"26/04/19, 7:56:33 AM",Sush, another dude asked me if he could fuck me and followed me around
1651,"26/04/19, 7:56:44 AM",Sush, All in broad daylight!
1652,"26/04/19, 7:56:51 AM",Nikhil," I‚Äôve never claimed to be super woke, but I still think I‚Äôm ‚Äúin the loop‚Äù, but every now and then I realize that there‚Äôs so much of this shit going on that I don‚Äôt even have to think about"
1653,"26/04/19, 7:57:27 AM",Nikhil, That sounds awful
1654,"26/04/19, 7:57:54 AM",Sush, I think part of that is we just don‚Äôt talk about it that much + use public transport way more in the US than at home
1655,"26/04/19, 7:59:19 AM",Nikhil," I mean, i do HEAR about women complaining about harassment on public transport, but rarely stop to think about what that means, I guess"
1656,"26/04/19, 7:59:20 AM",Sush, ie the reason a lot of well meaning men don‚Äôt realise
1657,"26/04/19, 7:59:47 AM",Nikhil," Also yeah, I don‚Äôt think i‚Äôve actually used public transport in ages"
1658,"26/04/19, 7:59:55 AM",Sush, this was in the middle of afternoon trying to get to a meeting
1659,"26/04/19, 8:00:00 AM",Nikhil, Other than on vacation
1660,"26/04/19, 8:00:01 AM",Nikhil, Fuck
1661,"26/04/19, 8:00:05 AM",Sush, Threw me off my game for some time
1662,"26/04/19, 8:00:13 AM",Nikhil, I can imagine
1663,"26/04/19, 8:00:45 AM",Sush, plus it‚Äôs chicago I‚Äôm always like cool he probably has a gun this is how I go
1664,"26/04/19, 8:01:26 AM",Sush, my friend Erin and I saw a fight break out last month complete with a knife and threats to kill etc
1665,"26/04/19, 8:01:27 AM",Nikhil, Oh god yes. I forgot that about the US
1666,"26/04/19, 8:02:11 AM",Nikhil," So one thing about living in Dubai is that, on the one hand, it‚Äôs obviously an outrageously sexist society"
1667,"26/04/19, 8:02:33 AM",Nikhil," On the other hand, it‚Äôs like absurdly safe (as far as I can tell)"
1668,"26/04/19, 8:02:44 AM",Sush, So I‚Äôve heard!
1669,"26/04/19, 8:03:21 AM",Sush, Yeah when people try to say like separate women‚Äôs compartments in the metro is regressive etc
1670,"26/04/19, 8:03:30 AM",Sush, I‚Äôm like PLS GIVE IT TO ME
1671,"26/04/19, 8:03:38 AM",Nikhil, Lol
1672,"26/04/19, 8:03:49 AM",Nikhil, They have that in most indian cities no?
1673,"26/04/19, 8:03:57 AM",Sush, yeah they do thank god
1674,"26/04/19, 8:04:32 AM",Sush, but this also gets annoying why don‚Äôt account for demand
1675,"26/04/19, 8:04:41 AM",Sush, Like airport security lines in the Bangalore airport
1676,"26/04/19, 8:04:56 AM",Sush, fucking nuisance
1677,"26/04/19, 8:05:05 AM",Nikhil, Hmm?
1678,"26/04/19, 8:05:11 AM",Sush, They have like 3 lines for women and 15 for men
1679,"26/04/19, 8:05:31 AM",Sush, and the gender ratio of their footfall is NOT proportionate
1680,"26/04/19, 8:05:54 AM",Sush, Women‚Äôs lines are always suuuuper long with half the men‚Äôs lines just being empty
1681,"26/04/19, 8:06:12 AM",Sush, It‚Äôs only a metal detector also I don‚Äôt really care who wields it
1682,"26/04/19, 8:06:15 AM",Nikhil," Huh. Most places i‚Äôve been the women‚Äôs queues were, if anything, more lightly trafficked. But that‚Äôs in the Middle East."
1683,"26/04/19, 8:06:40 AM",Sush, I guess Bangalore is also a specific example
1684,"26/04/19, 8:06:54 AM",Sush, Have noticed it in the mornings in Chennai
1685,"26/04/19, 8:07:43 AM",Sush, my fav is these insti boys who think we shouldn‚Äôt have had gender segregated dorms
1686,"26/04/19, 8:07:48 AM",Sush, NO THANK U
1687,"26/04/19, 8:07:56 AM",Nikhil, Haha
1688,"26/04/19, 8:09:25 AM",Nikhil, So I am currently simultaneously obsessed with both Ezra Furman and George Ezra
1689,"26/04/19, 8:09:51 AM",Sush, Who are they?
1690,"26/04/19, 8:10:31 AM",Nikhil, Musicians
1691,"26/04/19, 8:11:02 AM",Nikhil," Fairly different actually but if I put a mix on YouTube from one I still end up getting both due to how the algorithm works, weirdly "
1692,"26/04/19, 8:11:28 AM",Nikhil, I don‚Äôt know if you like this kind of music at all but it‚Äôs still a fun video
1694,"26/04/19, 8:11:29 AM",Sush, Send me a song!
1695,"26/04/19, 8:11:45 AM",Sush, About to get on a long Uber ride lol
1696,"26/04/19, 8:12:23 AM",Nikhil, Look for ‚Äúmy hero‚Äù by Ezra furman and ‚Äúshotgun‚Äù by george Ezra
1697,"26/04/19, 9:38:35 AM",Sush, i like this a lot!
1698,"08/05/19, 9:05:16 AM",Sush, Found this looking for something else loll
1699,"[08/05/19, 9:05:27 AM",Sush, ‚Äéimage omitted
1700,"08/05/19, 9:16:09 AM",Nikhil, Haha
1701,"08/05/19, 9:16:16 AM",Nikhil," Wow, 2013!"
1702,"08/05/19, 11:46:26 AM",Sush, yeah 
1703,"08/05/19, 11:46:33 AM",Sush, when we are TINY
1704,"08/05/19, 11:49:50 AM",Nikhil, Do you like who you are today better than who you were in 2013?
1705,"08/05/19, 11:50:09 AM",Nikhil," Sorry, too deep too soon, but just thought about it"
1706,"08/05/19, 12:21:51 PM",Sush, ugh i'm trying to remember who i was in 2013
1707,"08/05/19, 12:22:08 PM",Sush, 4th/5th year of insti
1708,"08/05/19, 12:22:15 PM",Sush, i like who i am today better!
1709,"08/05/19, 12:22:16 PM",Sush, you?
1710,"08/05/19, 1:31:41 PM",Nikhil," I think I‚Äôm a better person now and I‚Äôm probably about as happy if not slightly better, but I feel weirdly sluggish sometimes. Like a loss of vitality, or something."
1711,"08/05/19, 1:33:31 PM",Nikhil, I had to wait 20 minutes in line because the online check in didn‚Äôt work and now this flight is delayed again
1712,"08/05/19, 5:21:06 PM",Sush, i actually feel a bit more energetic now. i'm def more engaged in my work than i was then (even though i complain about my work now) EVERYTHING hurts more though lol
1713,"08/05/19, 7:37:07 PM",Sush, everything = neck and back mostly lol
1714,"08/05/19, 7:37:28 PM",Sush, were you in schlumberger?
1715,"09/05/19, 12:36:07 AM",Nikhil," Actually, I guess engagement is actually higher for me too, despite the bitching"
1716,"09/05/19, 12:36:31 AM",Nikhil," I mean, I‚Äôm complaining a lot but schlumberger as you just reminded me was way worse "
1717,"09/05/19, 12:37:59 AM",Nikhil," Although it was definitely ‚Äúsimpler‚Äù, both in terms of intellectual effort required for the job (which is not a good thing) and just the general extra effort needed for career management, networking, etc at McKinsey (which does get stressful for me)"
1718,"09/05/19, 12:33:33 PM",Sush, hahaha
1719,"09/05/19, 12:33:46 PM",Sush, yeahhh the stakes for everything were lower in 2013 i guess
1720,"09/05/19, 12:34:05 PM",Sush, and there's just slightly less anxiety over WHO AM I
1721,"09/05/19, 12:34:19 PM",Sush," not that i know better, but that i'm a little more ok with not knowing"
1722,"09/05/19, 12:34:44 PM",Nikhil, You have slightly less anxiety over it now you mean?
1723,"09/05/19, 12:34:51 PM",Sush, yes
1724,"09/05/19, 12:35:16 PM",Nikhil, I actually had this sense of ‚ÄúI could be so many more things‚Äù that was fairly exhilarating
1725,"09/05/19, 12:35:39 PM",Sush, hmm that's fair!
1726,"09/05/19, 12:35:54 PM",Sush, i have more of that now - but that's mostly because my second degree was way better for me
1727,"09/05/19, 12:35:58 PM",Nikhil, Right now I just feel ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a 30 year old consultant who doesn‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs doing next‚Äù and that‚Äôs just a cliche
1728,"09/05/19, 12:37:01 PM",Sush, that's reasonable!
1729,"09/05/19, 12:37:21 PM",Sush, idk if this is good or bad but when i plan for my life i feel like i'm still 25 
1730,"09/05/19, 12:37:59 PM",Sush, wait do you turn 30 this year or did you turn 30 last year?
1731,"09/05/19, 12:48:37 PM",Nikhil, I am already 30
1732,"09/05/19, 12:48:56 PM",Nikhil," I think it‚Äôs good and it‚Äôs not as if 30 is, in fact, old, really"
1733,"09/05/19, 12:49:03 PM",Sush, you graduated end of my 2nd year no?
1734,"09/05/19, 12:49:04 PM",Sush, yeah
1735,"09/05/19, 12:49:09 PM",Nikhil, It‚Äôs more this mental feeling locked down thing
1736,"09/05/19, 12:49:26 PM",Nikhil, Yeah I think so
1737,"09/05/19, 12:49:43 PM",Sush, fair
1738,"09/05/19, 12:49:49 PM",Sush, i also do feel that sometimes
1739,"09/05/19, 12:51:46 PM",Nikhil, I feel like I‚Äôve had this conversation before 
1740,"09/05/19, 12:52:01 PM",Sush, Lol
1741,"09/05/19, 12:52:05 PM",Nikhil, I also have a tendency to blame it on my marriage which even I recognize as being very unfair
1742,"09/05/19, 12:52:54 PM",Sush, It‚Äôs probably the institution rather than your specific marriage no
1743,"09/05/19, 12:56:05 PM",Nikhil," I mean, sure"
1744,"09/05/19, 1:02:41 PM",Sush, I still want to get a PhD maybe 
1745,"09/05/19, 1:03:16 PM",Sush, Also!
1746,"09/05/19, 1:03:27 PM",Sush, Remember the married person?
1747,"09/05/19, 1:03:33 PM",Sush, He applied to work at my lab
1748,"09/05/19, 1:03:43 PM",Sush, Which made me feel super weird
1749,"09/05/19, 1:03:51 PM",Sush, Thankfully my prof was like lol no
1750,"09/05/19, 1:10:30 PM",Nikhil, Haha
1751,"09/05/19, 1:10:32 PM",Nikhil, Because of your thing?(I‚Äôm assuming not?)
1752,"09/05/19, 9:05:42 PM",Sush," i mean, no"
1753,"09/05/19, 9:05:49 PM",Sush, but our lab has like three people lol
1754,"09/05/19, 9:05:56 PM",Sush, it's just awkward
1755,"16/05/19, 12:48:54 PM",Sush, how pissed are you at game of thrones
1756,"16/05/19, 12:49:06 PM",Sush, (right answer is *very* )
1757,"16/05/19, 12:53:33 PM",Nikhil, I‚Äôm getting over it because I‚Äôm now pissed at other things
1758,"16/05/19, 12:53:44 PM",Sush, ugh fair
1759,"16/05/19, 12:53:46 PM",Nikhil," I‚Äôve been a bit pissed all day and it‚Äôs quite exhausting, actually"
1760,"16/05/19, 12:53:51 PM",Sush, other life things?
1761,"16/05/19, 12:53:55 PM",Sush, or other media?
1762,"16/05/19, 12:54:01 PM",Nikhil, But yeah I was SO pissed even though I knew it was going to happen
1763,"16/05/19, 12:54:04 PM",Nikhil, Life things 
1764,"16/05/19, 12:54:17 PM",Sush, ayy i'm sorry!
1765,"16/05/19, 12:54:28 PM",Nikhil," No, like bullshit life things"
1766,"16/05/19, 12:54:28 PM",Sush, ü§¨x1000
1767,"16/05/19, 12:55:32 PM",Nikhil," Like not getting the project I wanted, having to do some minor extra work on something I thought was done, and most of all tremendously pissed at the dumbfuck delivery driver who called me once, didn‚Äôt respond to the 3 times I called him after, called me once again right when I was in a meeting, and then decided he had waited too long and left"
1768,"16/05/19, 12:55:53 PM",Sush, ugh that all sucks!
1769,"16/05/19, 12:56:00 PM",Nikhil, It does
1770,"16/05/19, 12:56:30 PM",Nikhil, Also pissed that I‚Äôm in Riyadh on a Thursday in the first place even though I was initially ok with it since Mia is in India anyway
1771,"16/05/19, 12:56:34 PM",Sush, do you (and mia) have time to go do something fun and distracting with mia?
1772,"16/05/19, 12:56:42 PM",Sush, ohh nvm
1773,"16/05/19, 12:57:30 PM",Nikhil, So I was having dinner by myself and this partner at the office drops in and says hi and says you look very clearly sad and as I explain some of these things I can see how silly a lot of it sounds
1774,"16/05/19, 12:57:43 PM",Nikhil, Which eh
1775,"16/05/19, 12:57:52 PM",Nikhil, Mia is actually coming back tomorrow morning
1776,"16/05/19, 12:58:13 PM",Nikhil," But I was a bit pissed at her also, although we had a ‚Äúconstructive‚Äù conversation about it last night"
1777,"16/05/19, 12:58:52 PM",Sush," i hate that. i had a fair bit of that this past week, i think."
1778,"16/05/19, 12:58:54 PM",Nikhil, I find her way of giving career advice and some of her general quirks and annoyances much more annoying if I‚Äôm already in a bad mood.
1779,"16/05/19, 12:59:47 PM",Nikhil," Yeah? Like, the unsolicited hey hows it goings? I honestly don‚Äôt mind that too much usually"
1780,"16/05/19, 1:00:00 PM",Sush, that's fair! career advice is hard to hear at the best of times
1781,"16/05/19, 1:00:53 PM",Sush, esp when the person its coming has a v different way of operating wrt their career (and is a loved one impacted by your decisions and vice-versa)
1782,"16/05/19, 1:01:07 PM",Sush," no, being bogged down by things which sound pretty silly"
1783,"16/05/19, 1:01:21 PM",Sush, *person its coming from
1784,"16/05/19, 1:06:34 PM",Nikhil," So I get annoyed/stressed out enough by work, but also have a habit of not being proactive enough or doing something about it"
1785,"16/05/19, 1:07:01 PM",Nikhil, Mia has a tendency to make these things feel a LOT more like a personal failing
1786,"16/05/19, 1:07:43 PM",Nikhil," (And I mean, I get that it is, strictly speaking, but you know what I mean...do you?)"
1787,"16/05/19, 1:08:21 PM",Sush, i know what you mean! i am a lot like you're describing yourself too and i've definitely seen people who *don't* have that tendency be utterly befuddled by it
1788,"16/05/19, 1:09:00 PM",Sush, to them it's like all the pieces to the puzzle are there why wouldn't you just put them together
1789,"16/05/19, 1:09:40 PM",Sush, it's hard to articulate why that feels impossible sometimes lol
1790,"16/05/19, 1:10:30 PM",Nikhil," And ‚Äúimpacted by‚Äù etc is all fine but I have (what is think is) the healthy perspective that, if I take an extra 6 months or a year to get promoted or if I quit and do something else it‚Äôs not like we‚Äôre going to, forget starve, have any meaningful change to our standard of living"
1791,"16/05/19, 1:11:01 PM",Sush, that's very true
1792,"16/05/19, 1:11:28 PM",Nikhil, Whereas for her any time you‚Äôre not maximizing your potential is a loss
1793,"16/05/19, 1:14:17 PM",Sush, i wonder how we can shift frameworks while talking to another person about their issues
1794,"16/05/19, 1:14:39 PM",Sush, like GIVEN YOUR FRAMEWORK maybe you could do this?
1795,"16/05/19, 1:14:48 PM",Sush, and you doing the same for her
1796,"16/05/19, 1:15:09 PM",Nikhil, Elaborate?
1797,"16/05/19, 1:15:26 PM",Nikhil, We had a discussion on roughly those lines yesterday
1798,"16/05/19, 1:15:43 PM",Sush," like when she gives you career advice, she sets aside her own framework"
1799,"16/05/19, 1:15:57 PM",Sush, she gives you advices optimizing for the things _you're_ optimizing for
1800,"16/05/19, 1:16:07 PM",Sush, as opposed to what _she's_ optimizing for
1801,"16/05/19, 1:16:25 PM",Sush," like, just accept that you're optimizing for different things and take it from there"
1802,"16/05/19, 1:19:45 PM",Nikhil, Hmm
1803,"16/05/19, 1:20:35 PM",Nikhil," I think it is also a different optimization approach as well as goal, and I also think these are almost values differences in some weird sense, but yeah, I get it"
1804,"16/05/19, 1:21:09 PM",Nikhil," I get where she‚Äôs coming from, because she has this whole thing where she‚Äôs seen friends who are more, like, idle rich, and she wants never to be seen like that, etc"
1805,"16/05/19, 1:21:44 PM",Nikhil," Btw, I don‚Äôt do it very often, but I like that you don‚Äôt much encourage me bitching about Mia "
1806,"16/05/19, 1:23:48 PM",Sush, You definitely don't do it often! I think I've felt alienated from my friends in the past when they sort of join me in bitching about someone i love haha.
1807,"16/05/19, 1:23:59 PM",Sush, I guess it's not super constructive and also she sounds mostly great 
1808,"16/05/19, 1:24:03 PM",Nikhil," Talk later, flights taking off"
1809,"16/05/19, 1:24:53 PM",Sush," alrighty, fly safe!"
1810,"22/05/19, 3:59:21 PM",Nikhil, Yo
1811,"22/05/19, 4:00:02 PM",Nikhil, https
1812,"26/05/19, 11:24:45 PM",Sush, I just read this
1813,"26/05/19, 11:24:47 PM",Sush, Sooo good
1814,"26/05/19, 11:26:46 PM",Sush, I want to send it to Siddharth but I think he‚Äôll get mad lmao
1815,"27/05/19, 10:58:17 AM",Sush, Ok listen lol
1816,"27/05/19, 3:35:40 PM",Nikhil, ?
1817,"27/05/19, 3:36:23 PM",Sush, Lol
1818,"27/05/19, 3:36:29 PM",Sush, I‚Äôm at Siddharth‚Äôs wedding
1819,"27/05/19, 3:36:38 PM",Sush, I was having some emotions in the morning
1820,"27/05/19, 3:36:46 PM",Sush, Now I‚Äôm happy only
1821,"27/05/19, 3:37:49 PM",Sush, Was feeling a little weird about being here when I texted you
1822,"27/05/19, 3:38:02 PM",Nikhil, Ah 
1823,"27/05/19, 3:38:12 PM",Nikhil, Where is this exactly?
1824,"27/05/19, 3:38:26 PM",Sush, Columbus Ohio
1825,"27/05/19, 3:38:34 PM",Nikhil, Interesting
1826,"27/05/19, 3:39:31 PM",Sush, Yeahh I was a little bit like maybe I shouldn‚Äôt have come
1827,"27/05/19, 3:39:50 PM",Sush, But then I talked to him and the wedding was beautiful and I‚Äôm happy I came
1828,"27/05/19, 4:02:28 PM",Sush, This is a lot lol
1829,"27/05/19, 4:31:51 PM",Nikhil, Are you like calm and happy or weirded out happy?
1830,"27/05/19, 4:52:09 PM",Sush, I‚Äôm calm only
1831,"27/05/19, 4:54:08 PM",Sush, It‚Äôs a little weird to have so many people talk about the inevitability of it
1832,"27/05/19, 4:54:33 PM",Sush, Also omg his mom said I thought he was going to tell me he met the love of his life in iitm but he didn‚Äôt lmao
1833,"27/05/19, 4:54:42 PM",Sush, And like four people looked at me
1834,"28/05/19, 12:51:31 PM",Sush, Hihi
1835,"28/05/19, 12:52:26 PM",Sush, There was a tornado and I‚Äôm on a very circuitous flight back home
1836,"28/05/19, 1:34:24 PM",Nikhil, Oh damn
1837,"28/05/19, 1:35:26 PM",Nikhil, Ohio is pretty close no?
1838,"28/05/19, 1:35:38 PM",Sush, It is
1839,"28/05/19, 1:35:47 PM",Sush, I‚Äôm in philly now lol
1840,"28/05/19, 1:35:55 PM",Nikhil, Whoa 
1841,"28/05/19, 1:35:58 PM",Sush, Columbus - philly - Chicago
1842,"28/05/19, 1:36:15 PM",Sush, What a stupid tornado I‚Äôm v mad
1843,"28/05/19, 1:36:25 PM",Nikhil, I can imagine.
1844,"28/05/19, 1:36:44 PM",Nikhil, Did you take a couple of days off for the wedding or is this some holiday season I don‚Äôt know about?
1845,"28/05/19, 1:36:55 PM",Sush, Yesterday was Memorial Day
1846,"28/05/19, 1:37:15 PM",Sush, So I went to Ohio yday morning and was supposed to leave last night
1847,"28/05/19, 1:37:27 PM",Nikhil, Ah I see
1848,"28/05/19, 1:38:20 PM",Nikhil," It‚Äôs Tuesday night here and we typically fly out from the client site on Wednesday, with thursdays being work from office/home - so for me it‚Äôs almost like the end of the week "
1849,"28/05/19, 1:43:39 PM",Sush, So nice!
1850,"28/05/19, 1:43:51 PM",Sush, Are you guys doing something fun
1851,"28/05/19, 1:44:14 PM",Nikhil," Er, I‚Äôm still in Saudi and browsing twitter instead of working"
1852,"28/05/19, 1:45:04 PM",Sush, Lolol
1853,"28/05/19, 1:45:06 PM",Sush," I mean, fair"
1854,"28/05/19, 1:45:10 PM",Sush, The twitter part
1855,"28/05/19, 1:45:51 PM",Nikhil, And obsessively reading the 3 body problem (which I finished yesterday actually - on to the sequel now)
1856,"28/05/19, 1:45:59 PM",Nikhil, I should probably be working much harder
1857,"28/05/19, 1:46:02 PM",Sush, Ohhh how was it
1858,"28/05/19, 1:46:36 PM",Nikhil," I mean, the writing isn‚Äôt great and I‚Äôm sure if I thought more about it the plot holes would be glaring, but it was pretty exciting to read"
1859,"28/05/19, 1:47:04 PM",Sush, I want to obsessively read something
1860,"28/05/19, 1:52:52 PM",Nikhil, I‚Äôm going to try and sleep early today and wake up and get some work done
1861,"28/05/19, 1:53:18 PM",Sush, Good luck!
1862,"04/06/19, 12:08:06 PM",Sush, hii
1863,"05/06/19, 2:06:20 AM",Nikhil, Hey 
1864,"15/06/19, 3:27:55 AM",Nikhil," You‚Äôve done one of these meditation retreats, no?"
1865,"15/06/19, 7:02:08 AM",Sush, No but I really want to
1866,"15/06/19, 7:14:49 AM",Sush, You‚Äôre thinking of trying ?
1867,"15/06/19, 7:15:27 AM",Nikhil, Just thought about it
1868,"15/06/19, 8:30:24 AM",Sush, A friend of mine went to vipassana and got sober!
1869,"15/06/19, 8:31:42 AM",Sush, idk if he was an ‚Äòaddict‚Äô but his alcohol and drug consumption were seriously getting in the way of being a regular functioning adult
1870,"15/06/19, 8:55:50 AM",Nikhil, Yeah?
1871,"15/06/19, 8:56:08 AM",Nikhil, I think quite a lot of us are functioning semi alcoholics actually
1872,"15/06/19, 8:57:05 AM",Sush, This girl I vaguely wrote about her experience too 
1874,"15/06/19, 8:56:44 AM",Nikhil," I already crave it every weekend, and not in a social way, just in a drink/read/ watch Tv way."
1875,"15/06/19, 8:57:43 AM",Sush, Yeah? Have you ever tried going off for a few weeks?
1876,"15/06/19, 8:57:56 AM",Sush, *i vaguely know
1877,"19/06/19, 2:05:19 PM",Sush, hi friend
1878,"19/06/19, 2:05:43 PM",Sush, are you doing vipassana
1879,"19/06/19, 2:05:56 PM",Nikhil, Hey
1880,"19/06/19, 2:06:15 PM",Nikhil," I should, I‚Äôm pretty stressed out and don‚Äôt k ow when it‚Äôll get better"
1881,"19/06/19, 2:06:29 PM",Nikhil, But I also don‚Äôt know when I‚Äôll have the time 
1882,"19/06/19, 2:06:35 PM",Nikhil, How‚Äôs it going?
1883,"19/06/19, 2:06:37 PM",Sush, I hear you -_- I'm not _stressed out_ but I'm very adrift.
1884,"19/06/19, 2:06:54 PM",Sush, and i can't even put underscores in the right spots
1885,"19/06/19, 2:07:16 PM",Nikhil, Why are you adrift?
1886,"19/06/19, 2:07:37 PM",Sush," untethered in work, life and love "
1887,"19/06/19, 2:07:44 PM",Sush, hahaha that sounds way more dramatic than it is
1888,"19/06/19, 2:08:10 PM",Sush, it's not that bad i'm just back to being in a pre-transition phase
1889,"19/06/19, 2:08:42 PM",Nikhil, I actually am feeling a bit too tethered and kind of chomping at the bit to just go off and not do anything and bum around for a few months by myself. Even as I know that that would likely be depressing
1890,"19/06/19, 2:08:47 PM",Nikhil, Pre transition? To?
1891,"19/06/19, 2:08:59 PM",Sush, ugh if only we could average out
1892,"19/06/19, 2:09:22 PM",Sush, i guess this is the source of some stress
1893,"19/06/19, 2:09:38 PM",Sush, also feeling the pressure of turning 28 soon
1894,"19/06/19, 2:09:58 PM",Sush, do you have any time off in the near future?
1895,"19/06/19, 2:10:17 PM",Nikhil, I don‚Äôt know if 28 is so much of a milestone that you need to stress out over it 
1896,"19/06/19, 2:10:28 PM",Nikhil, I‚Äôll have a week off in August
1897,"19/06/19, 2:10:39 PM",Sush, it feels like a warning sign 
1898,"19/06/19, 2:10:44 PM",Sush, like a signal to course correct
1899,"19/06/19, 2:11:26 PM",Nikhil," I actually just had a week off start of June! but we were furniture shopping, which was far more stressful and time consuming than expected, and I was living with my in-laws, and overall was much less relaxed than I preferred"
1900,"19/06/19, 2:11:52 PM",Sush, furniture shopping for new house?
1901,"19/06/19, 2:11:54 PM",Nikhil, Course correct from what (and I think an accurate assessment here is important) and to (very broadly) what?
1902,"19/06/19, 2:11:56 PM",Nikhil, Yeah
1903,"19/06/19, 2:12:24 PM",Nikhil, So my parents are flying in tomorrow and we are doing a house warming thing they forced me to do on Friday
1904,"19/06/19, 2:12:29 PM",Nikhil, Which I‚Äôm still annoyed about
1905,"19/06/19, 2:13:07 PM",Sush," from being in this post-student limbo to actually embarking on some sort of path in data science - but question is what path, where and when to transition"
1906,"19/06/19, 2:13:25 PM",Sush, ohhh my parents did this to my sister and she was v annoyed too
1907,"19/06/19, 2:13:35 PM",Nikhil, Yeah?
1908,"19/06/19, 2:13:46 PM",Sush," yeah, it was a nuisance for everyone"
1909,"19/06/19, 2:13:51 PM",Nikhil, So it‚Äôs actually very annoying for a couple of different reasons
1910,"19/06/19, 2:14:00 PM",Sush, but they were convinced not doing it would end up in complete disaster
1911,"19/06/19, 2:14:07 PM",Nikhil," One, it‚Äôs a major nuisance and the house is nowhere near ready to have guests"
1912,"19/06/19, 2:14:17 PM",Nikhil, And Mia is stressing out over it like mad
1913,"19/06/19, 2:15:23 PM",Sush, is it just close family?
1914,"19/06/19, 2:15:31 PM",Nikhil, Yeah
1915,"19/06/19, 2:16:13 PM",Nikhil," Two, what is especially annoying is that I think they‚Äôre also pushing for it to happen and for them to be there because they feel (and I‚Äôm not sure I fully understand it) that because her parents will be there when we move in, it is ‚Äúinappropriate‚Äù if they aren‚Äôt also there."
1916,"19/06/19, 2:16:51 PM",Sush, ohh that's very annoying
1917,"19/06/19, 2:17:21 PM",Sush, and these vague undefined 'responsibilities' are near impossible to talk people out of
1918,"19/06/19, 2:17:30 PM",Sush, 'it won't look good'
1919,"19/06/19, 2:17:33 PM",Sush, wtf does that MEAN
1920,"19/06/19, 2:17:35 PM",Nikhil, Yeah!
1921,"19/06/19, 2:17:59 PM",Nikhil, I‚Äôm just so happy I‚Äôm not living in India where all this would be SOOOO much worse
1922,"19/06/19, 2:18:09 PM",Sush," like, *this* doesnt look good to YOUR OWN OFFSPRING"
1923,"19/06/19, 2:18:22 PM",Sush, why doesn't that trump other considerations lol
1924,"19/06/19, 2:18:42 PM",Sush, ugh yeah it drives my sister nuts
1925,"19/06/19, 2:19:37 PM",Sush," and the expectations of hosting etc are all on her - ashwin is great and pulls his weight in their household but if he even makes a cup of coffee, guests are like SO SWEET HUSBAND"
1926,"19/06/19, 2:19:49 PM",Nikhil, Haha
1927,"19/06/19, 2:19:50 PM",Sush, whereas with my sister anything she does is seen as the least she could do
1928,"19/06/19, 2:20:46 PM",Nikhil," So Mia both genuinely hates doing anything in the kitchen, and also REALLY hates that she‚Äôs _expected_ to serve people and do all of this"
1929,"19/06/19, 2:21:10 PM",Nikhil, Which is one big reason why we don‚Äôt really invite people over
1930,"19/06/19, 2:21:23 PM",Nikhil, Which of course everyone also bitches about both directly and subtly
1931,"19/06/19, 2:21:40 PM",Sush, that's so unfair and irritating 
1932,"19/06/19, 2:22:06 PM",Sush, the expectation makes you hate it even more also
1933,"19/06/19, 2:22:37 PM",Sush, i do love cooking / hosting but i think it's really only possible for me to . because i've never been asked to do it and i only do it when i choose to
1934,"19/06/19, 2:23:00 PM",Nikhil, Yeah exactly
1935,"19/06/19, 2:23:11 PM",Sush, it's also so weird that you're expected to know all this overnight after you get married
1936,"19/06/19, 2:23:42 PM",Sush, i get allowances for things in a way that my sister doesnt - which makes no sense because my sister's never lived away from home and i haven't lived at home for ten years
1937,"19/06/19, 2:23:45 PM",Nikhil," In this case, she‚Äôs also never done it before at all and she has extreme perfectionist tendencies so if there‚Äôs a chance it will invite criticism she just won‚Äôt do it"
1938,"19/06/19, 2:24:12 PM",Sush, ohhh yeah that sounds stressful
1939,"19/06/19, 2:25:46 PM",Sush, how do you go about re-setting expectations?
1940,"19/06/19, 2:25:58 PM",Nikhil, Hmm?
1941,"19/06/19, 2:26:01 PM",Sush, it requires so much initial friction
1942,"19/06/19, 2:26:08 PM",Nikhil, Oh yes
1943,"19/06/19, 2:26:20 PM",Sush, like communicating to the family that you're just not interested/ inclined
1944,"19/06/19, 2:26:23 PM",Nikhil, And the thing is it still doesn‚Äôt actually get reset
1945,"19/06/19, 2:26:31 PM",Nikhil, They just get snippy about it
1946,"19/06/19, 2:27:23 PM",Sush, that's also so fucking annoying
1947,"19/06/19, 2:27:39 PM",Sush, passive aggression is the woooorst
1948,"19/06/19, 2:27:48 PM",Sush, my mom literally did this on FACETIME two days ago
1949,"19/06/19, 2:27:54 PM",Nikhil, Yeah?
1950,"19/06/19, 2:28:07 PM",Sush, she *always* thinks i look homeless
1951,"19/06/19, 2:28:20 PM",Sush, i'll be heading out and she'll say 'ok go get changed'
1952,"19/06/19, 2:28:27 PM",Sush," I'M CHANGED, MOTHER."
1953,"19/06/19, 2:28:33 PM",Sush, THIS IS WHAT I'M WEARING.
1954,"19/06/19, 2:28:42 PM",Nikhil, Haha
1955,"19/06/19, 2:29:09 PM",Sush, she facetimed me a couple of days ago and was like oh you're going to work? haven't gotten dressed yet?
1956,"19/06/19, 2:29:27 PM",Sush, it's 100% not a genuine mistake she knows exactly what she's saying lol
1957,"19/06/19, 2:30:00 PM",Nikhil, üòÅ
1958,"19/06/19, 2:30:16 PM",Nikhil, Sorry I guess it‚Äôs annoying but it does sound quite funny
1959,"19/06/19, 2:30:38 PM",Sush, i'm amused when i'm in a good mood but otherwise it makes me want to throw something lol
1960,"19/06/19, 2:32:46 PM",Sush, i've also been 'dating' of late
1961,"19/06/19, 2:32:52 PM",Sush, and usually i'm just indifferent
1962,"19/06/19, 2:33:00 PM",Sush, but i went on a date last week that i didn't hate
1963,"19/06/19, 2:33:05 PM",Nikhil, Hmm?
1964,"19/06/19, 2:33:08 PM",Sush, and i was like ok whatevs that was fun about it
1965,"19/06/19, 2:33:18 PM",Sush, but HE didn't reply to my text and now i'm obsessing lol
1966,"19/06/19, 2:33:23 PM",Nikhil, When were you officially not ‚Äòdating‚Äô 
1967,"19/06/19, 2:33:37 PM",Sush, like more actively
1968,"19/06/19, 2:33:48 PM",Nikhil, Ah ok
1969,"19/06/19, 2:34:06 PM",Sush," like, 'online dating'"
1970,"19/06/19, 2:34:15 PM",Nikhil, Lol I see
1971,"19/06/19, 2:34:17 PM",Sush, OMG do you want ugly gossip
1972,"19/06/19, 2:34:22 PM",Sush, i was so grossed out
1973,"19/06/19, 2:34:23 PM",Nikhil, Sure
1974,"19/06/19, 2:34:27 PM",Sush, remember that married dude?
1975,"19/06/19, 2:34:32 PM",Nikhil, Yeah?
1976,"19/06/19, 2:34:49 PM",Sush, i saw his profile under a FAKE NAME on a dating app
1977,"19/06/19, 2:34:55 PM",Nikhil, Ohh
1978,"19/06/19, 2:35:12 PM",Sush, i can't believe how deliberately awful that is
1979,"19/06/19, 2:36:37 PM",Nikhil," Yeah that‚Äôs pretty clearly not something ‚Äújust happening ‚Äù or being too weak or whatever, it‚Äôs a deliberate choice"
1980,"19/06/19, 2:36:39 PM",Sush, i was def right not to buy the 'conflicted' rhetoric phew
1981,"19/06/19, 2:36:49 PM",Sush, yeah!!!
1982,"19/06/19, 2:37:05 PM",Sush, and it's so so so insensitive
1983,"19/06/19, 2:37:11 PM",Sush, like what if her friends see it
1984,"19/06/19, 2:37:30 PM",Sush," if you're going to hurt someone you love, at least preserve their dignity while doing it?"
1985,"19/06/19, 2:37:44 PM",Sush," idk, it's so public and insulting to his wife"
1986,"19/06/19, 2:38:59 PM",Nikhil, Indeed
1987,"19/06/19, 2:39:41 PM",Nikhil," I was thinking, at best it ensures ppl from the app can‚Äôt stalk him in real life, but with photos the fake name does nothing whatsoever to preserve your anonymity with people you actually know"
1988,"19/06/19, 2:39:52 PM",Sush, yeah!
1989,"19/06/19, 2:40:09 PM",Sush, and he'll probably claim someone's using his pictures to catfish women if his wife finds out
1990,"19/06/19, 2:40:23 PM",Sush, it's so horrible!
1991,"19/06/19, 2:40:50 PM",Sush, and he's going to be a cop!
1992,"19/06/19, 2:40:56 PM",Sush, no integrity whatsoever .
1993,"19/06/19, 2:41:46 PM",Nikhil, He‚Äôs going to be a cop? I thought he was working in the same field as you?
1994,"19/06/19, 2:42:20 PM",Sush, he works for a violence prevention organization
1995,"19/06/19, 2:42:41 PM",Sush, which is part of a program that my lab is evaluating
1996,"19/06/19, 2:42:52 PM",Sush, he was also at uchicago when i was there
1997,"19/06/19, 2:43:35 PM",Sush, he's ex-military etc
1998,"19/06/19, 2:43:41 PM",Nikhil, Oh I see
1999,"19/06/19, 2:43:48 PM",Sush, i think this is also sketchy
2000,"19/06/19, 2:43:54 PM",Sush, his org doesn't know he's going to be a cop
2001,"19/06/19, 2:44:16 PM",Sush," and it's not nice to like, be present in gang mediations etc if you're going to join the damn police"
2002,"19/06/19, 2:44:59 PM",Nikhil, Hmm.
2003,"19/06/19, 2:45:22 PM",Sush, idk how much of the info is usable
2004,"19/06/19, 2:45:32 PM",Sush, but i do think the participants are entitled to know this
2005,"19/06/19, 2:46:23 PM",Nikhil, Or the org
2006,"19/06/19, 2:46:42 PM",Sush, yeahh
2007,"19/06/19, 2:46:49 PM",Sush, i hate to be a judgey aunty
2008,"19/06/19, 2:46:52 PM",Sush, but MORAL DECAY
2009,"19/06/19, 2:46:54 PM",Sush, lol
2010,"19/06/19, 2:48:15 PM",Nikhil, Haha
2011,"19/06/19, 2:48:43 PM",Nikhil," I think this is pretty established immorality, not fresh decay"
2012,"19/06/19, 2:49:15 PM",Sush, true 
2013,"19/06/19, 2:49:24 PM",Sush, moral decay of an individual
2014,"19/06/19, 2:49:54 PM",Sush, i guess it is literally the oldest most universal form of immorality
2015,"19/06/19, 2:50:23 PM",Sush, ohh watch Fleabag?
2016,"19/06/19, 2:53:42 PM",Nikhil, Nope
2017,"19/06/19, 2:53:58 PM",Sush, I think you‚Äôll like!
2018,"19/06/19, 2:54:03 PM",Nikhil, Yeah?
2019,"19/06/19, 2:54:07 PM",Nikhil, I heard about it
2020,"19/06/19, 2:54:39 PM",Sush, It makes you feel a little hopeless sometimes but also makes you laugh and have #warm feelings
2021,"19/06/19, 2:54:39 PM",Nikhil, I‚Äôm sufficiently passive now that I mostly only watch things if they come up within 5 minutes of scrolling through Netflix
2022,"19/06/19, 2:55:09 PM",Sush, Phoebe Waller price is incredibly talented
2023,"19/06/19, 2:55:17 PM",Nikhil, I remember her from Crashing
2024,"19/06/19, 2:55:26 PM",Sush, And Olivia Coleman is in it and is phenomenal
2025,"19/06/19, 2:55:38 PM",Sush, It‚Äôs actually not dissimilar is general tone
2026,"19/06/19, 2:55:46 PM",Sush, But I liked it a lot more
2027,"19/06/19, 2:56:04 PM",Sush, It‚Äôs on amazon prime
2028,"19/06/19, 2:56:47 PM",Nikhil, Yeah I still need to get that
2029,"19/06/19, 2:57:10 PM",Nikhil, My amazon account is still us based and I obviously don‚Äôt want to pay for prime in the US
2030,"19/06/19, 2:57:22 PM",Nikhil, But if I change countries all my kindle stuff gets changed
2031,"19/06/19, 2:58:08 PM",Sush, ugh yeah
2032,"19/06/19, 2:58:19 PM",Sush, you can use mine
2033,"19/06/19, 2:58:31 PM",Sush, let me check if im home if i share the password with other apps haha
2034,"19/06/19, 2:58:38 PM",Sush, *when
2035,"19/06/19, 2:58:43 PM",Nikhil, Haha
2036,"19/06/19, 2:59:21 PM",Nikhil," That‚Äôs sweet but I might just get Mia to change hers - also US, but since she doesn‚Äôt use it i think that should be fine."
2037,"19/06/19, 3:01:31 PM",Sush, ok 
2038,"19/06/19, 3:03:46 PM",Nikhil," The shows you have access to depends on the country you‚Äôre watching from and not the country your account is based in, no?"
2039,"19/06/19, 3:04:25 PM",Sush, yes
2040,"19/06/19, 3:04:36 PM",Sush, my netflix options look v different in hyd
2041,"19/06/19, 3:05:33 PM",Nikhil," Which is a bit weird if you only care about video (for prime), since it‚Äôs like 999/year in India and I think 100+ dollars in the us"
2042,"19/06/19, 3:06:20 PM",Nikhil, And prime video is 6$/month in Dubai
2043,"19/06/19, 3:06:49 PM",Sush, i can't actually use my .com prime privileges on the .in site though
2044,"19/06/19, 3:08:47 PM",Nikhil, Yes I would assume so
2045,"19/06/19, 3:08:57 PM",Nikhil, Ok I have been half heartedly staring at my laptop
2046,"19/06/19, 3:09:08 PM",Nikhil, It‚Äôs 11 and I have at least an hour of work
2047,"19/06/19, 3:09:19 PM",Nikhil, So I‚Äôm going to go finish it off and sleep
2048,"19/06/19, 3:09:22 PM",Sush, ok good luck 
2049,"19/06/19, 3:09:25 PM",Sush, ttyl!
2050,"19/06/19, 3:09:46 PM",Nikhil," Man, i‚Äôve been saying ‚Äúwrite something‚Äù for ages now and never got around to it "
2051,"19/06/19, 3:09:53 PM",Nikhil, Conversation for later
2052,"19/06/19, 3:09:55 PM",Nikhil, Bye!
2053,"19/06/19, 3:10:10 PM",Sush, 
2054,"[30/06/19, 8:41:55 AM",Sush, ‚Äéimage omitted
2055,"30/06/19, 8:42:05 AM",Sush, I think we do this üòÇ
2056,"30/06/19, 8:42:36 AM",Nikhil, Lol
2057,"20/07/19, 7:57:25 AM",Sush, Hello!
2058,"20/07/19, 7:57:55 AM",Nikhil, Hello!
2059,"[20/07/19, 7:57:59 AM",Sush, ‚ÄéGIF omitted
2060,"20/07/19, 7:58:24 AM",Nikhil, I‚Äôm day drinking and just enjoying my uninterrupted sea view
2061,"20/07/19, 7:58:36 AM",Sush, Oooh where are you?
2062,"20/07/19, 7:58:46 AM",Nikhil," Er, just my new apartment"
2063,"20/07/19, 7:59:02 AM",Sush, Hahaha wonderful!!
2064,"20/07/19, 7:59:16 AM",Sush, Show me your view!
2065,"20/07/19, 7:59:29 AM",Nikhil, It‚Äôs ungodly hot but will go down to the pool in a bit I think
2066,"20/07/19, 7:59:31 AM",Nikhil, Hmm
2067,"20/07/19, 7:59:48 AM",Sush, It‚Äôs so hot here too!
2068,"20/07/19, 7:59:57 AM",Sush, We‚Äôre having a heat wave
2069,"[20/07/19, 8:00:32 AM",Nikhil, ‚Äéimage omitted
2070,"20/07/19, 8:00:45 AM",Sush, I mean it‚Äôs still only a max of 35C
2071,"20/07/19, 8:00:49 AM",Nikhil, Really? It‚Äôs 40 degrees here- what is it there?
2072,"20/07/19, 8:00:51 AM",Sush, Oooh lovely!
2073,"20/07/19, 8:00:58 AM",Nikhil, Ah ok
2074,"20/07/19, 8:01:27 AM",Nikhil, So it‚Äôs ‚Äú39 but feels like 52‚Äù because of 52% humidity right now
2075,"20/07/19, 8:01:35 AM",Sush, Oh gosh
2076,"20/07/19, 8:02:06 AM",Nikhil, Yep
2077,"20/07/19, 8:02:12 AM",Sush, It‚Äôs 27 feels like 29 with 73% humidity already and it‚Äôs only 8 am
2078,"20/07/19, 8:02:28 AM",Sush, Also all these apartments are built to trap heat
2079,"20/07/19, 8:02:46 AM",Sush, Because ‚Äòtoo much heat‚Äô happens like 5 days in a year lol
2080,"20/07/19, 8:02:53 AM",Nikhil, Lol
2081,"20/07/19, 8:03:06 AM",Nikhil, But 29 is still pretty ok no?
2082,"20/07/19, 8:03:14 AM",Nikhil, I guess mid day might be worse
2083,"20/07/19, 8:03:18 AM",Sush, Yeah
2084,"20/07/19, 8:03:27 AM",Sush, Idk if it‚Äôs the angle or what
2085,"20/07/19, 8:03:42 AM",Sush, But I think 37 in Chicago feels more enervating than 37 in Hyderabad
2086,"20/07/19, 8:04:10 AM",Sush, Or I just spend more time outdoors / walking here
2087,"20/07/19, 8:04:38 AM",Nikhil, I had to look up enervating because I thought it actually meant the opposite of what it actually means
2088,"20/07/19, 8:04:58 AM",Sush, üòÇ I guess it sounds like energising!
2089,"20/07/19, 8:05:14 AM",Nikhil, 
2090,"20/07/19, 8:05:33 AM",Sush, I am actually feeling kinda bummed out
2091,"20/07/19, 8:05:42 AM",Sush, It‚Äôs very likely I‚Äôll need a spinal surgery
2092,"20/07/19, 8:05:55 AM",Nikhil, Oh no! How come?
2093,"20/07/19, 8:06:02 AM",Sush," A discectomy, apparently"
2094,"20/07/19, 8:06:29 AM",Sush, I have a large herniation in c5-c6 which has been causing all my neck pain stuff
2095,"20/07/19, 8:12:34 AM",Nikhil, Ouch
2096,"20/07/19, 8:12:43 AM",Nikhil, I‚Äôm sorry
2097,"20/07/19, 8:13:29 AM",Nikhil, So I also had this sudden and annoying back pain and went to see the doctor and took some x rays and an ultrasound in case it‚Äôs kidney stones but most likely it‚Äôs just a posture/muscle sprain thing
2098,"20/07/19, 8:13:52 AM",Sush, Ohh I‚Äôm glad it isn‚Äôt anything more
2099,"20/07/19, 8:14:23 AM",Sush, Is it better?
2100,"20/07/19, 8:15:04 AM",Sush, In a way it‚Äôs good to have a diagnosis now after pain on and off for like four years
2101,"20/07/19, 8:15:24 AM",Nikhil," It‚Äôs better, yeah"
2102,"20/07/19, 8:15:40 AM",Nikhil, But i‚Äôve also had it on and off for a bit
2103,"20/07/19, 8:15:46 AM",Nikhil, Mostly upper back minor aches
2104,"20/07/19, 8:16:14 AM",Nikhil," Then a sharp thing in my lower back after playing with my cousins, then a pain in the same place randomly a week later, which is why I saw the doctor"
2105,"20/07/19, 8:16:25 AM",Sush, Oh ouch!
2106,"20/07/19, 8:16:41 AM",Sush, Why are our backs so dumb and weak ü§¨
2107,"20/07/19, 8:17:03 AM",Sush, Like a little disc in my back just decided to expel its innards?
2108,"20/07/19, 8:17:19 AM",Sush, How gross and how pointless!
2109,"20/07/19, 8:17:40 AM",Sush, #baddesign
2110,"20/07/19, 8:26:22 AM",Nikhil, 
2111,"20/07/19, 8:27:14 AM",Nikhil, Its quite interesting to think of all these health issues in terms of the evolutionary design trade offs that probably led to it happening
2112,"20/07/19, 8:27:41 AM",Nikhil," Is it just that we are now out of the testing environment parameters, or is it just not meant to work this way?"
2113,"20/07/19, 8:28:29 AM",Sush, Maybe we are the point at which adjustments will start to happen
2114,"20/07/19, 8:28:47 AM",Sush, I‚Äôm the unfit that‚Äôs getting seeded out atm
2115,"20/07/19, 8:28:52 AM",Sush, *weeded
2116,"20/07/19, 8:28:54 AM",Nikhil," Except that evolution is way slower than, you know, pills and prosthetics"
2117,"20/07/19, 8:29:33 AM",Sush," Yeah, I guess it‚Äôs good we have pills plans prosthetics meanwhile"
2118,"20/07/19, 8:30:14 AM",Sush, 200 years from now our spines will know how to use computers for ten hours a day
2119,"20/07/19, 8:30:17 AM",Sush, 2000?
2120,"20/07/19, 8:30:26 AM",Sush, Lol
2121,"20/07/19, 8:30:41 AM",Nikhil, 200 is 6 generations which is clearly not going to be much /)
2122,"20/07/19, 8:31:20 AM",Nikhil," 60, maybe, if the pressure is acute enough. Just need to make sure people with back issues don‚Äôt get to hook up as much "
2123,"20/07/19, 8:31:44 AM",Sush, üòÖüòÖ
2124,"20/07/19, 8:32:04 AM",Sush, Im so over my back
2125,"20/07/19, 8:32:21 AM",Sush, Spent all day yday feeling VERY SORRY for myself
2126,"20/07/19, 8:32:58 AM",Sush, also about how as a society we still don‚Äôt know how to provide care to adults outside marriage
2127,"20/07/19, 8:33:09 AM",Nikhil, Hmm?
2128,"20/07/19, 8:33:36 AM",Sush, Like I‚Äôm only 27 but i was reading through how to handle post-op care
2129,"20/07/19, 8:33:49 AM",Sush, and it‚Äôs not awful but it would be hard to do by yourself
2130,"20/07/19, 8:34:28 AM",Sush, Like I shouldn‚Äôt bend too much for six weeks
2131,"20/07/19, 8:34:39 AM",Sush, Can‚Äôt lift more than a gallon of milk
2132,"20/07/19, 8:35:06 AM",Sush, Shouldn‚Äôt reach up over my head / run / jump
2133,"20/07/19, 8:36:42 AM",Nikhil, Ouch
2134,"20/07/19, 8:37:27 AM",Sush," My parents want to come, which I might let them do üòÖ"
2135,"20/07/19, 8:37:39 AM",Sush," but you know, otherwise"
2136,"20/07/19, 8:37:42 AM",Nikhil," I guess the idea is not marriage necessarily, but just that bad health makes it much more important to have someone who cares for you around to help"
2137,"20/07/19, 8:38:01 AM",Sush, Yep - and we haven‚Äôt figured out ways to do that outside marriage
2138,"20/07/19, 8:43:23 AM",Nikhil, Hmm
2139,"20/07/19, 8:43:54 AM",Nikhil," I mean, the capitalist solution, of course, is to pay someone to care"
2140,"20/07/19, 8:44:17 AM",Nikhil," And a more ancient solution is just community care, which has its issues"
2141,"20/07/19, 8:44:43 AM",Sush, I guess I wish my friends lived closer
2142,"20/07/19, 8:44:53 AM",Sush, I would have been waaaay less worried in Hyde park
2143,"20/07/19, 8:45:00 AM",Sush, (Before I moved)
2144,"20/07/19, 8:45:10 AM",Nikhil, Yeah but to your point you still basically need someone who lives with you
2145,"20/07/19, 8:45:47 AM",Sush, True it‚Äôs so much easier with a community though
2146,"20/07/19, 8:46:06 AM",Sush, Last year a friend went through chemo
2147,"20/07/19, 8:46:24 AM",Sush, And a ‚Äòcare circle‚Äô formed almost organically
2148,"20/07/19, 8:46:34 AM",Sush, Because we were all already in this tiny community
2149,"20/07/19, 8:47:26 AM",Sush, Physical proximity makes help less of a big ask
2150,"20/07/19, 8:54:52 AM",Nikhil, True
2151,"20/07/19, 8:55:12 AM",Nikhil," God, I can‚Äôt even imagine how I‚Äôd react if I just found out I had to get chemo"
2152,"20/07/19, 8:55:22 AM",Sush," Yeah, no??"
2153,"20/07/19, 8:55:38 AM",Sush, She‚Äôs in remission now
2154,"20/07/19, 8:55:43 AM",Sush," So, phew!"
2155,"20/07/19, 8:56:01 AM",Sush, I called my dad and cried for this only
2156,"20/07/19, 8:56:29 AM",Sush," Stepped out of the hospital, walked across to the lake and bawled lol"
2157,"20/07/19, 8:56:41 AM",Sush, I was dressed up too - went to a conference right after
2158,"20/07/19, 8:56:50 AM",Sush, I must have made a ridiculous sight
2159,"20/07/19, 8:56:59 AM",Nikhil, üò¢
2160,"20/07/19, 8:57:30 AM",Sush, I‚Äôm so annoyed!!!
2161,"20/07/19, 8:57:41 AM",Sush, Apparently I have to get an epidural steroid first
2162,"20/07/19, 8:58:02 AM",Sush, Because insurance won‚Äôt cover surgery unless they see a non surgical method attempted
2163,"20/07/19, 8:58:25 AM",Sush, And the doctor basically that will most likely not help me üôÑ
2164,"20/07/19, 8:58:27 AM",Nikhil, ü§ó
2165,"20/07/19, 8:58:36 AM",Nikhil, Ok that‚Äôs not what I wanted to send
2166,"20/07/19, 8:58:44 AM",Nikhil, There is apparently no appropriate hugging emoji
2167,"20/07/19, 8:58:51 AM",Sush, HahahaüòÇ
2168,"20/07/19, 8:59:03 AM",Nikhil," And ok, that‚Äôs just randomly annoying"
2169,"20/07/19, 8:59:07 AM",Sush, It is a failure of imagination tbh
2170,"20/07/19, 8:59:17 AM",Sush, The absence of a proper hug emoji
2171,"20/07/19, 8:59:25 AM",Nikhil, 
2172,"20/07/19, 8:59:38 AM",Sush, Right?!
2173,"20/07/19, 9:00:50 AM",Nikhil, So the one thing I was relatively happy with was the insurance process here
2174,"20/07/19, 9:01:42 AM",Nikhil," Like, I did have to wait a day for them to approve the ultrasound, and also had to wait while they corrected some paperwork issue in the hospital, but that aside, no real work for me, and no cost at all out of pocket."
2175,"20/07/19, 9:01:56 AM",Sush, that‚Äôs amazing!
2176,"20/07/19, 9:02:04 AM",Nikhil," I mean, I believe I have the ‚Äúgood‚Äù insurance, but even so."
2177,"20/07/19, 9:02:52 AM",Sush, This wasn‚Äôt too terrible except that the ortho surgeon is v v busy and I was sitting on my MRI for nearly three weeks before I could see him
2178,"20/07/19, 9:03:19 AM",Sush, and there were hoops to jump through for the MRI
2179,"20/07/19, 9:03:34 AM",Sush, and it‚Äôs all pretty expensive even with pretty good insurance
2180,"20/07/19, 9:03:56 AM",Sush, but American healthcare is such a shitshow
2181,"20/07/19, 9:03:57 AM",Nikhil, Hmm?
2182,"20/07/19, 9:04:04 AM",Sush, I take the absence of a disaster as a win
2183,"20/07/19, 9:04:31 AM",Nikhil, Lol

2185,"20/07/19, 10:30:05 AM",Nikhil, So I‚Äôm walking from where we live to where Mia is getting her hair done
2186,"20/07/19, 10:30:26 AM",Nikhil, Which is about 30 minutes across a sea bridge + the beach
2187,"20/07/19, 10:31:00 AM",Nikhil, But so hot! So humid!
2188,"20/07/19, 10:31:12 AM",Sush, Ugggh

2197,"30/07/19, 2:26:14 PM",Sush, questionnn
2198,"30/07/19, 2:26:29 PM",Sush, oh time difference

2200,"30/07/19, 2:29:05 PM",Nikhil, No it‚Äôs only 1030
2201,"30/07/19, 2:29:08 PM",Nikhil, What‚Äôs up?
2202,"30/07/19, 2:29:19 PM",Sush, ohh lol i can't add
2203,"30/07/19, 2:29:21 PM",Sush, SO

2205,"30/07/19, 2:29:35 PM",Nikhil, Ok?

2207,"30/07/19, 2:29:43 PM",Sush, she's a GOOD and KIND person
2208,"30/07/19, 2:29:48 PM",Nikhil, Ah 
2209,"30/07/19, 2:29:53 PM",Sush, but also hyper-anxious and noisy and fluttering constantly
2210,"30/07/19, 2:30:11 PM",Sush, and it's _terrible_ for my productivity
2211,"30/07/19, 2:30:23 PM",Sush, so we're moving to a different building in a couple of weeks
2212,"30/07/19, 2:30:40 PM",Sush, should i just be like HEY so what if i shared will person Y instead? i think our working styles are more aligned
2213,"30/07/19, 2:30:50 PM",Nikhil, Lol
2214,"30/07/19, 2:30:51 PM",Sush, will i come off as uncooperative??
2215,"30/07/19, 2:31:14 PM",Nikhil, What is ‚Äúuncooperative ‚Äú?
2216,"30/07/19, 2:31:18 PM",Sush, i literally can't be around this anxious energy anymore
2217,"30/07/19, 2:31:26 PM",Sush, like idk difficult to work with
2218,"30/07/19, 2:31:44 PM",Sush, (also like not to be that bitch but we were in academic research - 99% of things are NOT urgent)
2219,"30/07/19, 2:31:49 PM",Nikhil, But you‚Äôre not ‚Äúworking with‚Äù this person
2220,"30/07/19, 2:31:49 PM",Sush, *work in
2221,"30/07/19, 2:32:04 PM",Nikhil, You‚Äôre sharing an office with her
2222,"30/07/19, 2:32:09 PM",Sush, no i work with her
2223,"30/07/19, 2:32:27 PM",Nikhil, Ah. So do you need to discuss things together?
2224,"30/07/19, 2:32:32 PM",Sush," person i share with - dawna , person i WANT to share with - dallas"
2225,"30/07/19, 2:32:36 PM",Sush," yeah, sometimes"
2226,"30/07/19, 2:32:44 PM",Sush, and we all 'work together' - like all 4 of us
2227,"30/07/19, 2:32:54 PM",Sush, and she won't STOP talking about reports
2228,"30/07/19, 2:32:57 PM",Sush, it drives me nuts
2229,"30/07/19, 2:33:11 PM",Sush, and i can't do like 'science' if i'm interrupted CONSTANTLY
2230,"30/07/19, 2:33:23 PM",Nikhil, Ok so then you‚Äôre not asking for anything that makes it harder for other people to work with you
2231,"30/07/19, 2:33:34 PM",Sush, i'll do reports - comprehensively and on time - but i don't want to talk about them!
2232,"30/07/19, 2:33:42 PM",Sush," no, i don't think i . am"
2233,"30/07/19, 2:34:02 PM",Nikhil, I thought you were going to ask if saying this would piss off dawna
2234,"30/07/19, 2:34:11 PM",Nikhil," Which, I mean, I dunno"
2235,"30/07/19, 2:34:17 PM",Sush," it could, no?"
2236,"30/07/19, 2:34:19 PM",Nikhil," But uncooperative, I don‚Äôt think so"
2237,"30/07/19, 2:34:40 PM",Nikhil, Those are different things
2238,"30/07/19, 2:34:39 PM",Sush, and i'd have to float the idea to andy (the prof) lol
2239,"30/07/19, 2:34:45 PM",Sush, that is true
2240,"30/07/19, 2:34:54 PM",Sush, dallas is so quiet
2241,"30/07/19, 2:35:00 PM",Sush, and he's pleasant
2242,"30/07/19, 2:35:07 PM",Sush, dawna's a great person too
2243,"30/07/19, 2:35:08 PM",Nikhil, Dallas is a male name?
2244,"30/07/19, 2:35:10 PM",Sush, yeah
2245,"30/07/19, 2:35:24 PM",Sush, she's hardworking and sincere and *very* kind
2246,"30/07/19, 2:35:30 PM",Sush, but the FLUTTERING ENERGY
2247,"30/07/19, 2:37:16 PM",Sush," and i'm overqualified to just do REPORTS, you know?"
2248,"30/07/19, 2:37:35 PM",Sush, and andy's pushing me on my own research - so i *need* to be able to focus lol
2249,"30/07/19, 2:38:07 PM",Sush, i like dawna a LOT and not sharing space with her would allow me to continue to lol
2250,"30/07/19, 2:39:23 PM",Nikhil, Sorry there was an accidental voice note
2251,"30/07/19, 2:39:29 PM",Sush, (it all sounds so petty in writing)
2252,"30/07/19, 2:39:34 PM",Sush, haha i didn't receive it
2253,"30/07/19, 2:39:38 PM",Nikhil," Wait, is she more senior?"
2254,"30/07/19, 2:39:51 PM",Sush," she is, she's a manager"
2255,"30/07/19, 2:39:55 PM",Sush, but i don't report to her
2256,"30/07/19, 2:40:07 PM",Nikhil, Ah I see
2257,"30/07/19, 2:40:22 PM",Sush, we both report to andy
2258,"30/07/19, 2:40:36 PM",Sush, but she's a sr. program manager and has a phd
2259,"30/07/19, 2:40:37 PM",Nikhil, Ok
2260,"30/07/19, 2:40:53 PM",Sush, ALSO
2261,"30/07/19, 2:41:05 PM",Sush, she keeps asking me for results!
2262,"30/07/19, 2:41:08 PM",Sush, it's been THREE MONTHS
2263,"30/07/19, 2:41:19 PM",Sush, into a GUN VIOLENCE REDUCTION program
2264,"30/07/19, 2:41:22 PM",Sush, there are NONE
2265,"30/07/19, 2:41:26 PM",Nikhil, Sorry but remind me again exactly what your role is right now? üòä
2266,"30/07/19, 2:41:31 PM",Sush, data scientist
2267,"30/07/19, 2:41:41 PM",Sush, whatever that means
2268,"30/07/19, 2:41:46 PM",Nikhil, Sure but what does that mean exactly?
2269,"30/07/19, 2:41:48 PM",Nikhil, Lol
2270,"30/07/19, 2:41:56 PM",Sush," quantitative researcher, i guess?"
2271,"30/07/19, 2:42:01 PM",Sush, she does ethnography stuff
2272,"30/07/19, 2:42:17 PM",Sush, i do or manage the quant research across all projects
2273,"30/07/19, 2:42:38 PM",Sush, (i have undergrad/grad RAs)
2274,"30/07/19, 2:42:58 PM",Sush, and project management
2275,"30/07/19, 2:43:14 PM",Nikhil, Ok
2276,"30/07/19, 2:43:37 PM",Sush, american busy olympics is EXHAUSTING
2277,"30/07/19, 2:43:52 PM",Sush, she keeps asking me if i nothing to do lol
2278,"30/07/19, 2:44:02 PM",Sush, i'm doing a LOT!
2279,"30/07/19, 2:44:09 PM",Sush, i just don't FLUTTER while doing it
2280,"30/07/19, 2:44:15 PM",Sush, (and i *can* tweet and code)
2281,"30/07/19, 2:44:22 PM",Nikhil, Lol
2282,"30/07/19, 2:45:05 PM",Sush, yesterday she passive-aggressively texted me at 1pm saying 'are u coming in today???'
2283,"30/07/19, 2:45:23 PM",Sush, i'd been at a partner's office since 8 am lol
2284,"30/07/19, 2:45:29 PM",Sush, with andy
2285,"30/07/19, 2:46:03 PM",Sush, sorry i'm whining
2286,"30/07/19, 2:46:12 PM",Sush, about pretty minor shit
2287,"30/07/19, 2:46:47 PM",Nikhil," Ok, so from a hierarchical view, you‚Äôre essentially an independent service provider with specialized expertise and your own loose team of people that report to you, and she‚Äôs someone who does the more direct research whose work you facilitate?"
2288,"30/07/19, 2:47:24 PM",Nikhil," No that‚Äôs fine. I wish I had your problems, generally, but I also get how annoying it can be "
2289,"30/07/19, 2:48:33 PM",Sush," Actually, my work and her work have nothing to do with each other - except that along with ethnographic research, she handles grant / partner reporting so she has to ask me for updates on the statistics aspect of projects"
2290,"30/07/19, 2:48:52 PM",Nikhil, Ah ok
2291,"30/07/19, 2:49:21 PM",Sush, Her research and mine don't feed into each other
2292,"30/07/19, 2:49:29 PM",Nikhil, So even less of a quasi reporting relationship
2293,"30/07/19, 2:49:41 PM",Sush, yeah!
2294,"30/07/19, 2:50:17 PM",Sush, i hate busywork so much
2295,"30/07/19, 2:50:44 PM",Sush, i *need* to be compensated for less pay with more autonomy l ol
2296,"30/07/19, 2:50:55 PM",Sush, which i GET from my actual boss
2297,"30/07/19, 2:54:04 PM",Sush, i will be so bad in corporate america i think lol
2298,"30/07/19, 2:54:11 PM",Sush, or corporate anywhere maybe
2299,"30/07/19, 2:54:44 PM",Nikhil," Corporate anywhere probably has similar issues, but you mostly get over it "
2300,"30/07/19, 2:55:02 PM",Sush, you're paid enough to get over it 
2301,"30/07/19, 2:55:12 PM",Nikhil, Lol true
2302,"[30/07/19, 2:56:35 PM",Sush, ‚Äéimage omitted
2303,"30/07/19, 2:56:47 PM",Sush, ugh it's so ugly here
2304,"30/07/19, 2:57:00 PM",Nikhil, I do that on slides all the time 
2305,"30/07/19, 2:57:08 PM",Sush, üòÇ
2306,"08/08/19, 3:40:49 PM",Sush, hii
2307,"08/08/19, 3:41:04 PM",Nikhil, Hey!
2308,"08/08/19, 3:41:12 PM",Sush, how are you?
2309,"08/08/19, 3:41:19 PM",Nikhil, Good
2310,"08/08/19, 3:41:33 PM",Nikhil, Somewhat of a rollercoaster couple of weeks 
2311,"08/08/19, 3:41:50 PM",Sush, oh yeah? what's up?
2312,"08/08/19, 3:42:06 PM",Nikhil, Mostly random shit that‚Äôs not worth mentioning with distance 
2313,"08/08/19, 3:42:22 PM",Nikhil, How are you doing?
2314,"08/08/19, 3:44:16 PM",Sush, Slightly similar actually
2315,"08/08/19, 3:44:30 PM",Sush, I'm feeling v miserable today
2316,"08/08/19, 3:44:40 PM",Nikhil, What happened?
2317,"08/08/19, 3:44:45 PM",Sush, got a steroid shot for my neck yesterday and the pain's worse
2318,"08/08/19, 3:44:54 PM",Sush, which is normal for ~ 48-72 hours apparently
2319,"08/08/19, 3:45:01 PM",Sush, and here's the weird thing about pain
2320,"08/08/19, 3:45:12 PM",Sush, there's nothing to DO or SAY about it
2321,"08/08/19, 3:45:16 PM",Sush," it's just THERE, you know?"
2322,"08/08/19, 3:45:47 PM",Nikhil," Well, if you‚Äôre like me, you could just keep whining until your loved ones get annoyed "
2323,"08/08/19, 3:45:54 PM",Sush, but it gets in the way of everything and i feel resentful when people express SYMPATHY
2324,"08/08/19, 3:45:58 PM",Sush, hahaha
2325,"08/08/19, 3:46:20 PM",Nikhil," Btw, I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not as bad, but one of the many things that happened is my back being really weird"
2326,"08/08/19, 3:46:26 PM",Nikhil, Mild aches all the time
2327,"08/08/19, 3:46:31 PM",Sush, i also get annoyed when people trivialize it
2328,"08/08/19, 3:46:32 PM",Sush, uuuugh
2329,"08/08/19, 3:46:49 PM",Sush, i hate to sound trite - but are you able to just WALK for 45-60 minutes a day?
2330,"08/08/19, 3:46:55 PM",Sush, it frees up even my back
2331,"08/08/19, 3:48:48 PM",Nikhil," Yeah? I‚Äôve not been working out at all recently, went once this week and just used the elliptical for 20 minutes but nothing else, don‚Äôt know how linked it is."
2332,"08/08/19, 3:49:02 PM",Nikhil, How bad is your pain?
2333,"08/08/19, 3:49:09 PM",Sush, it's so bad!!
2334,"08/08/19, 3:49:18 PM",Sush, i was exhausted beyond the point of sleep yday i think
2335,"08/08/19, 3:49:24 PM",Sush, the usual pain is worse
2336,"08/08/19, 3:49:42 PM",Sush, and there's an added soreness from the injection site and the steroid is still being absorbed
2337,"08/08/19, 3:49:47 PM",Sush, i thought i was going to die lol
2338,"08/08/19, 3:50:07 PM",Sush, when they injected it - there was this huge pressure building up rapidly inside my shoulder and neck
2339,"08/08/19, 3:50:16 PM",Sush, but then they said that's normal and it subsided slowly
2340,"08/08/19, 3:51:14 PM",Nikhil, Oh wow
2341,"08/08/19, 3:51:28 PM",Nikhil, Yeah mines nothing like that
2342,"08/08/19, 3:52:22 PM",Sush, i think walking is really good for back related stuff because your posture straightens up
2343,"08/08/19, 3:52:27 PM",Sush, and it's low impact
2344,"08/08/19, 3:52:40 PM",Nikhil, I hear swimming also works? Will try tomorrow
2345,"08/08/19, 3:52:46 PM",Nikhil, I have a whole week off!
2346,"08/08/19, 3:52:53 PM",Sush, even if it resumes hurting when i'm back it hurts less while i'm walking
2347,"08/08/19, 3:53:03 PM",Nikhil, And due to the previously mentioned rollercoaster I‚Äôm not going anywhere
2348,"08/08/19, 3:53:03 PM",Sush, ooh yes! my doc said swimming on your back is v good
2349,"08/08/19, 3:53:32 PM",Sush, ohho i think you'll be rest up nicely at home!
2350,"08/08/19, 3:53:38 PM",Sush," take long walks, read books!"
2351,"08/08/19, 3:55:09 PM",Sush, ooh read 'i like to watch'
2352,"08/08/19, 3:55:19 PM",Sush, it's a collection of essays by emily nussbaum on tv
2353,"08/08/19, 3:55:23 PM",Sush, i'm enjoying it v much
2354,"08/08/19, 3:55:36 PM",Nikhil, Yeah?
2355,"08/08/19, 3:55:45 PM",Sush," i took the day off yesterday - i had to be in bed and not use my computer, so i actually read"
2356,"08/08/19, 3:56:16 PM",Nikhil, I actually haven‚Äôt read a ‚Äúreal‚Äù physical book in a while
2357,"08/08/19, 3:56:29 PM",Nikhil," Lots on the phone or kindle, but no books"
2358,"08/08/19, 3:56:39 PM",Nikhil, They‚Äôre actually surprisingly expensive in Dubai anyway
2359,"08/08/19, 3:56:59 PM",Sush, in america too!
2360,"08/08/19, 3:57:12 PM",Sush, this is maybe only the second book i've bought in the US
2361,"08/08/19, 3:58:58 PM",Sush, goodreads is telling me i've only read FIVE books ALL YEAR
2362,"08/08/19, 4:00:09 PM",Nikhil, I‚Äôm playing the marvel spider man game on ps 
2363,"08/08/19, 4:00:39 PM",Sush, i basically have no idea what that is but you sound happy about it so yay! haha
2364,"08/08/19, 4:01:14 PM",Sush, are you still blogging btw
2365,"08/08/19, 4:01:18 PM",Nikhil," Haha it‚Äôs just a game, but it‚Äôs quite good"
2366,"08/08/19, 4:01:37 PM",Nikhil," No, but that was something I thought I would start again this break!"
2367,"08/08/19, 4:02:00 PM",Nikhil," So, I can‚Äôt actually write much on my own name if I want to be very honest"
2368,"08/08/19, 4:02:30 PM",Sush, i kinda want to to - both data sci stuff and (mostly) tv
2369,"08/08/19, 4:02:41 PM",Sush, because professional thingies?
2370,"08/08/19, 4:02:54 PM",Nikhil," But I‚Äôm considering doing a pseudonymous thing, essentially about consulting life in the Middle East, which if you think about it from a slightly distant perspective, is actually really weird!"
2371,"08/08/19, 4:03:25 PM",Sush, ooh i love the idea of that!

2387,"08/08/19, 4:08:04 PM",Sush, i want to make it super low stakes
2388,"08/08/19, 4:08:12 PM",Sush, barriers to posting should be v low
2389,"08/08/19, 4:08:17 PM",Sush, i think you had a tumblr no?
2390,"08/08/19, 4:12:11 PM",Nikhil," I did, yes"
2391,"08/08/19, 4:12:39 PM",Nikhil, You SHOULD write about tv and books and movies and being in your twenties
2392,"08/08/19, 4:12:45 PM",Nikhil, I kind of miss doing that
2393,"08/08/19, 4:13:01 PM",Nikhil," And I know I could, but I get this self censorship any time I think about it"
2394,"08/08/19, 4:13:07 PM",Nikhil," Like, ‚Äúthat just sounds dumb‚Äù"
2395,"08/08/19, 4:13:28 PM",Sush," no, it's totally not dumb! and we live in a time where we can make anything a statement "
2396,"08/08/19, 4:14:54 PM",Nikhil, True 
2397,"08/08/19, 4:15:40 PM",Sush, and like you said if you are uncomfortable make it pseudonymous
2398,"08/08/19, 4:15:53 PM",Sush, but lol have i told you the story of this girl anu joshy in my class at insti
2399,"08/08/19, 4:16:00 PM",Sush, who THOUGHT she had an anonymous blog
2400,"08/08/19, 4:16:10 PM",Sush, lolol it was SO MEAN but also *very* funnt
2401,"08/08/19, 4:16:12 PM",Sush, *funny
2402,"08/08/19, 4:16:21 PM",Nikhil, Ooh tell
2403,"08/08/19, 4:16:29 PM",Sush, she'd pour her heart out onto it thinking it was ANONYMOUS
2404,"08/08/19, 4:16:36 PM",Sush, but somehow the whole class knew it was her
2405,"08/08/19, 4:16:57 PM",Nikhil, Aww
2406,"08/08/19, 4:17:00 PM",Sush, this was probably before text chains or anything lol but the moment she posted everyone would be alerted
2407,"08/08/19, 4:17:07 PM",Sush, now i'm wondering if SHE was trolling us
2408,"08/08/19, 4:17:08 PM",Nikhil, Haha
2409,"08/08/19, 4:17:33 PM",Sush, she's write about members of the class with v thinly veiled references
2410,"08/08/19, 4:18:02 PM",Sush, i don't think anyone ever told her we knew it was her
2411,"08/08/19, 4:18:07 PM",Sush, i think she just got bored and stopped
2412,"08/08/19, 4:18:27 PM",Nikhil, That‚Äôs so funny
2413,"08/08/19, 4:18:42 PM",Sush, it was extremely entertaining
2414,"08/08/19, 4:19:21 PM",Nikhil, I actually had a blog in high school that was never anonymous but I sort of pretended it was
2415,"08/08/19, 4:19:40 PM",Sush, she was obsessed with siddharth - she wrote a poem about how he was a wayward shepherd and we were his docile and blind flock
2416,"08/08/19, 4:19:42 PM",Sush, oh yeah?
2417,"08/08/19, 4:19:46 PM",Nikhil, Then I told a friend about it and then everyone saw the weird shit I wrote about them
2418,"08/08/19, 4:19:51 PM",Sush, lolol
2419,"08/08/19, 4:20:00 PM",Nikhil, Hahaha
2420,"08/08/19, 4:20:13 PM",Nikhil, Wait this is Insti?
2421,"08/08/19, 4:20:16 PM",Sush, yeah!
2422,"08/08/19, 4:20:19 PM",Sush, like first year
2423,"08/08/19, 4:20:23 PM",Sush, when we ALL had blogs
2424,"08/08/19, 4:21:07 PM",Nikhil, Haha
2425,"08/08/19, 4:21:25 PM",Nikhil, Anu joshy sounds mallu?
2426,"08/08/19, 4:21:36 PM",Nikhil, Do I know this person?
2427,"08/08/19, 4:21:37 PM",Sush, yeah she is
2428,"08/08/19, 4:21:56 PM",Sush, hmm i don't know!
2429,"08/08/19, 4:22:34 PM",Sush, http
2430,"08/08/19, 4:22:43 PM",Sush, i can't remember if this was anonymous blog
2431,"08/08/19, 4:22:55 PM",Sush, that she ended up claiming
2432,"08/08/19, 4:26:19 PM",Nikhil, I‚Äôm just reading the excerpts and zoning out
2433,"08/08/19, 4:26:28 PM",Sush, yeah don't bother
2434,"08/08/19, 4:26:32 PM",Sush, it's a lot of rambling
2435,"08/08/19, 4:28:00 PM",Sush, have you come across this whole quantified self movement
2436,"08/08/19, 4:28:16 PM",Sush, https
2437,"08/08/19, 4:28:43 PM",Sush, i am intrigued by it - even while feeling a lot of resistance towards productivity tracking type exercises
2438,"08/08/19, 4:29:07 PM",Sush, i plotted my 'steps' since 2017 nov
2439,"08/08/19, 4:29:30 PM",Sush, and of course it looks very seasonal - plummets in chicago winters and peaks in the summer
2440,"08/08/19, 4:29:31 PM",Nikhil," Yes, actually"
2441,"08/08/19, 4:30:02 PM",Sush, but it does correlate with my general happiness i think and now i'm wondering if it's a good investment in my mental health to move someplace warmer (even tho i do ‚ù§ chicago)
2442,"[08/08/19, 4:31:33 PM",Sush, ‚Äéimage omitted
2443,"08/08/19, 4:31:38 PM",Nikhil," It‚Äôs kind of sad, but I do think there‚Äôs really not that many places with both great weather and great jobs"
2444,"08/08/19, 4:31:44 PM",Nikhil, Oh nice
2445,"08/08/19, 4:31:44 PM",Sush, california!
2446,"08/08/19, 4:32:09 PM",Sush, the LOWEST points are hyderabad lol
2447,"08/08/19, 4:32:16 PM",Sush, i don't leave my house for days on end
2448,"08/08/19, 4:32:26 PM",Nikhil, Haha
2449,"08/08/19, 4:32:40 PM",Sush, my mom's rude - she saw it and said well i guess you walk from your bed to the jhoola and back
2450,"08/08/19, 4:33:13 PM",Sush, maybe i should pull all my whatsapp texts and code them for sentiment
2451,"08/08/19, 4:33:21 PM",Sush, can't think of another proxy for mood
2452,"08/08/19, 4:33:30 PM",Sush, i also pulled my netflix viewing history
2453,"08/08/19, 4:33:35 PM",Sush, it's so embarrassing
2454,"08/08/19, 4:33:49 PM",Nikhil," I had to google jhoola, btw"
2455,"08/08/19, 4:34:04 PM",Sush, lol sorry 
2456,"08/08/19, 4:34:18 PM",Nikhil, No idea!
2457,"08/08/19, 4:34:25 PM",Sush, oonjal in tamil
2458,"08/08/19, 4:34:28 PM",Sush, =)
2459,"08/08/19, 4:35:12 PM",Nikhil, Btw Mia has wanted something like this for our apartment since we first got it
2460,"08/08/19, 4:35:23 PM",Nikhil, But I don‚Äôt know how we‚Äôll fit it
2461,"08/08/19, 4:35:26 PM",Sush, ooh i'd highly recommend it
2462,"08/08/19, 4:35:36 PM",Sush, it's such a fantastic reading spot
2463,"08/08/19, 4:35:43 PM",Nikhil, Oonjal is mallu also for swing 
2464,"08/08/19, 4:35:50 PM",Sush, but i think you have to put in hooks at the time of construction
2465,"08/08/19, 4:36:04 PM",Sush, or at least this is what we were told ~ 18 years ago
2466,"08/08/19, 4:36:50 PM",Sush," saturday mornings i'd have the house to myself -parents at work, sister had college"
2467,"08/08/19, 4:37:10 PM",Sush, the jhoola was equidistant from snacks and the tv 
2468,"08/08/19, 4:37:22 PM",Sush, and i'd make sure i had an unread book
2469,"08/08/19, 4:37:38 PM",Sush, lol it felt so decadent and wonderful
2470,"08/08/19, 4:38:10 PM",Sush, when i was kid i'd draw under the plank
2471,"08/08/19, 4:39:22 PM",Nikhil, Maybe we‚Äôll get it then 
2472,"08/08/19, 4:39:40 PM",Sush, i do love ours!
2473,"08/08/19, 4:39:59 PM",Sush, it used to be in my dad's house in vellore
2474,"08/08/19, 4:40:40 PM",Nikhil, You lived in vellore?
2475,"08/08/19, 4:41:37 PM",Sush," No, my dad brought it to hyderabad when his mom sold the house in vellore"
2476,"08/08/19, 4:41:45 PM",Sush," My dad did, yeah"
2477,"08/08/19, 4:42:02 PM",Sush, I think i've only been once or twice - they sold the house when i was like 2
2478,"08/08/19, 4:43:59 PM",Nikhil, Ah ok
2479,"08/08/19, 4:44:11 PM",Nikhil, Is your dad originally from there?
2480,"08/08/19, 4:44:37 PM",Sush, kind of? my grandfather worked with malaria control for the WHO so they moved a loot
2481,"08/08/19, 4:45:19 PM",Sush, but he did spend a sizable part of his childhood in vellore - when he and his siblings were old enough to not interrupt school they stayed put in vellore
2482,"08/08/19, 4:47:49 PM",Nikhil, My cousins live there
2483,"08/08/19, 4:48:05 PM",Nikhil, Although I haven‚Äôt been in ages
2484,"08/08/19, 4:49:23 PM",Sush, did you visit from insti?
2485,"08/08/19, 4:49:44 PM",Sush, one of my aunts splits her time between vellore and san francisco but i've never visited her
2486,"11/08/19, 3:16:03 PM",Sush, How's your staycation?
2487,"11/08/19, 3:16:19 PM",Nikhil, Hey!
2488,"11/08/19, 3:16:31 PM",Nikhil," Sorry, kind of blanked out and then slept off the other day"
2489,"11/08/19, 3:16:46 PM",Nikhil," Good, but we‚Äôre going to do the healthier version starting tomorrow"
2490,"11/08/19, 3:16:50 PM",Nikhil, More gym less booze
2491,"11/08/19, 3:17:19 PM",Nikhil, How are you doing?
2492,"11/08/19, 3:18:21 PM",Sush, Haha 
2493,"11/08/19, 3:18:47 PM",Sush, I'm okay! My back still feels very sore
2494,"11/08/19, 3:19:09 PM",Sush, so i have to be home and that's making me irritable and making me BROOD
2495,"11/08/19, 3:19:39 PM",Sush, am I just watching my twenties slip past?!
2496,"11/08/19, 3:19:55 PM",Sush, i'm stuck in a rut!
2497,"11/08/19, 3:20:33 PM",Nikhil, Brood on what?
2498,"11/08/19, 3:20:44 PM",Nikhil, Ha!
2499,"11/08/19, 3:21:13 PM",Sush, everything!
2500,"11/08/19, 3:21:34 PM",Sush, remember the 35 year old mikhail was seeing when we were 'poly' ?
2501,"11/08/19, 3:21:39 PM",Nikhil," (I say ‚Äúha!‚Äù listening to the single girl a year out of grad school tell me this, but I also realize I‚Äôm, like, 3 years older, so make of that what you will)"
2502,"11/08/19, 3:21:40 PM",Sush, they're still seeing each other!!!
2503,"11/08/19, 3:22:04 PM",Sush, she lives in ITALY
2504,"11/08/19, 3:22:06 PM",Nikhil," I remember this whole poly discussion but no specific 35 year old, actually"
2505,"11/08/19, 3:22:10 PM",Nikhil, Oh wow
2506,"11/08/19, 3:22:15 PM",Sush, they visit each other!

2511,"11/08/19, 3:23:35 PM",Sush, i don't even miss mikhail or anything
2512,"11/08/19, 3:23:46 PM",Sush, but i'm constantly measuring myself against this woman
2513,"11/08/19, 3:23:53 PM",Nikhil, Hmm?
2514,"11/08/19, 3:23:53 PM",Sush, even two years later
2515,"11/08/19, 3:24:13 PM",Sush, i think i'm prettier and younger (i hate myself for even saying this)
2516,"11/08/19, 3:24:25 PM",Sush," but in every other way, _I'D_ rather date her than me!"
2517,"11/08/19, 3:24:32 PM",Sush," she has a functioning spine, for one!"
2518,"11/08/19, 3:24:32 PM",Nikhil, Lol. Why?
2519,"11/08/19, 3:24:41 PM",Nikhil, üòí
2520,"11/08/19, 3:25:04 PM",Sush," acc to her instagram, they swam in the lake, biked through the woods and cooked a persian dinner"
2521,"11/08/19, 3:25:16 PM",Sush, he wooed me with a persian dinner!
2522,"11/08/19, 3:25:20 PM",Sush, i can't BIKE
2523,"11/08/19, 3:25:26 PM",Sush, and my back hurts all the time
2524,"11/08/19, 3:25:30 PM",Sush, i can't be fun and exciting!
2525,"11/08/19, 3:25:42 PM",Sush, (see - 20s just passing by)
2526,"11/08/19, 3:26:34 PM",Nikhil," Ok, that does admittedly suck. On the other hand, I‚Äôm not doing any of that either."
2527,"11/08/19, 3:26:55 PM",Sush, üò≠üò≠üò≠
2528,"11/08/19, 3:27:09 PM",Sush, is this social media fomo? idk
2529,"11/08/19, 3:27:12 PM",Nikhil," My point being, I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a lot more things you can do that you can‚Äôt do"
2530,"11/08/19, 3:27:14 PM",Sush, i had a beach day yesterday too
2531,"11/08/19, 3:27:26 PM",Nikhil," Also yes, social media is really good at inducing fomo"
2532,"11/08/19, 3:27:38 PM",Nikhil, You did? In Chicago? 
2533,"11/08/19, 3:27:52 PM",Sush, hey! lake michigan is huge!

2542,"11/08/19, 3:34:54 PM",Nikhil, So I had a ton of noodles and shrimp and rice and Thai curry
2543,"11/08/19, 3:35:10 PM",Nikhil, But now I‚Äôm making myself a grilled cheese
2544,"11/08/19, 3:35:22 PM",Sush, üòÇ i feel you
2545,"11/08/19, 3:35:24 PM",Nikhil, For no reason other than I‚Äôm watching a cooking show with a grilled cheese in it
2546,"11/08/19, 3:35:47 PM",Sush, ohh i'm loving a grilled cheese with pesto and goat cheese right now
2547,"11/08/19, 3:35:52 PM",Sush, SO GOOD
2548,"11/08/19, 3:35:58 PM",Nikhil, Wish I had some pesto actually
2549,"11/08/19, 3:36:14 PM",Sush, i made some a couple of weeks ago!
2550,"11/08/19, 3:36:27 PM",Sush, it's very easy and well worth the effort i think
2551,"11/08/19, 3:36:41 PM",Sush," i used almonds though, i didn't have pine nuts"
2552,"11/08/19, 3:37:43 PM",Sush, there was a time people thought MY LIFE was cool on insta!!
2553,"11/08/19, 3:37:56 PM",Sush, i'm feeling like 'post more' isn't the solution to this feeling though lol
2554,"11/08/19, 3:37:58 PM",Nikhil, Haha I still think your life is pretty cool 
2555,"11/08/19, 3:38:23 PM",Sush, i think that's just a case of the grass being greener on the other side!
2556,"11/08/19, 3:38:44 PM",Sush, i guess i really mean this - i've become lazy and bad about making the effort to do things i enjoy
2557,"11/08/19, 3:39:17 PM",Nikhil, I believe that‚Äôs a pretty common feeling
2558,"11/08/19, 3:39:22 PM",Nikhil," At least, I have it a lot"
2559,"11/08/19, 3:39:38 PM",Sush, how do we break out of it????
2560,"11/08/19, 3:39:45 PM",Sush, how to break bad patterns??

2564,"11/08/19, 3:43:29 PM",Sush, i googled 'i'm in a rut help' - it was not helpful
2565,"11/08/19, 3:43:48 PM",Sush, ugh yeah youre right
2566,"11/08/19, 3:44:17 PM",Sush, that's basically it lol - how do i more exciting things? do them

2577,"12/08/19, 2:44:49 PM",Nikhil, Mia said it tasted good and a lot better than she expected even though she doesn‚Äôt know if it was worth all the effort üòÖ
2578,"12/08/19, 2:45:04 PM",Sush, hahaha 
2579,"12/08/19, 2:46:41 PM",Nikhil," It was actually not bad, I think, and I know how to fix what I did wrong for next time, so happy overall "
2580,"12/08/19, 2:48:02 PM",Sush, awesome! did you enjoy the process?
2581,"12/08/19, 2:48:46 PM",Nikhil, Mostly?
2582,"12/08/19, 2:48:55 PM",Sush, fair üòÇ
2583,"12/08/19, 2:49:07 PM",Sush, cleaning and chopping onions are always the WORST imo
2584,"12/08/19, 2:49:36 PM",Sush," incidentally, i roasted carrots yesterday!"
2585,"12/08/19, 2:49:49 PM",Nikhil," Actually the onions were probably not strictly required. Most painful to cut, stank up the place, and didn‚Äôt add THAT much to the flavor"
2586,"12/08/19, 2:50:10 PM",Sush, they really are painful to cut
2587,"12/08/19, 2:50:17 PM",Sush, i also hate cutting sweet potato
2588,"12/08/19, 2:50:30 PM",Sush, tomatoes are my FAV to cut lol
2589,"12/08/19, 2:50:34 PM",Nikhil, Yeah?
2590,"12/08/19, 2:50:44 PM",Sush, ya they're so HARD
2591,"12/08/19, 2:51:06 PM",Nikhil," Better to cut after boiling/roasting, then?"
2592,"12/08/19, 2:51:12 PM",Sush, yes for sure
2593,"12/08/19, 2:51:32 PM",Sush, i had no idea roasting vegetables took this long
2594,"12/08/19, 2:51:39 PM",Sush, before i started using an oven
2595,"12/08/19, 2:52:15 PM",Nikhil," Yeah but the thing with the oven is you get to just leave it and do your thing, right?"
2596,"12/08/19, 2:52:22 PM",Nikhil, As opposed to frying or saut√©ing
2597,"12/08/19, 2:52:30 PM",Sush, that's true
2598,"12/08/19, 2:52:41 PM",Sush, it's so much faster if you parboil veggies though
2599,"12/08/19, 2:52:49 PM",Sush, idk - my mom doesn't like when i do it
2600,"12/08/19, 2:53:07 PM",Sush, but just microwaving for 4 minutes before going into the oven i think cooks the insides
2601,"12/08/19, 2:53:26 PM",Sush, and then it can just focus on becoming a little charred and crisp and delicious lol
2602,"12/08/19, 2:53:48 PM",Nikhil, Interesting
2603,"12/08/19, 2:54:28 PM",Nikhil, I finally got amazon prime so I‚Äôm watching American gods now btw
2604,"12/08/19, 2:54:39 PM",Sush, watch fleabag first!!!!!
2605,"[12/08/19, 2:55:20 PM",Sush, ‚ÄéGIF omitted
2606,"12/08/19, 2:55:38 PM",Nikhil," That good, is it?"
2607,"12/08/19, 2:55:48 PM",Sush, yes!
2608,"12/08/19, 2:55:58 PM",Sush," not to hype it up too much, but yes "
2609,"12/08/19, 2:56:04 PM",Nikhil," I wanted something dramatic and in a way safer, since I‚Äôm not sure how I‚Äôd take the humour"
2610,"12/08/19, 2:56:38 PM",Nikhil, Some of these really vary
2611,"12/08/19, 2:56:45 PM",Nikhil," Like, have you watched Bojack yet?"
2612,"12/08/19, 2:56:52 PM",Sush, the humour on fleabag is p absurd
2613,"12/08/19, 2:56:59 PM",Sush, but also very organic to the storyline
2614,"12/08/19, 2:57:03 PM",Sush, no I haven't!
2615,"12/08/19, 2:57:11 PM",Sush, I'm actually a little afraid of watching that lol
2616,"12/08/19, 2:57:55 PM",Nikhil, I remember somewhat reveling in the self destructiveness while binge watching season 3
2617,"12/08/19, 2:58:17 PM",Nikhil, But that‚Äôs a show that‚Äôs better than almost anything else i‚Äôve seen but will not be for everyone
2618,"12/08/19, 2:58:33 PM",Sush, i definitely want to watch at some point
2619,"12/08/19, 2:58:51 PM",Sush," fleabag also has uplifting moments, tbh"
2620,"12/08/19, 2:59:09 PM",Sush," oh i bought Circe yesterday, based partly on your goodreads"
2621,"12/08/19, 2:59:21 PM",Nikhil, Yeah?
2622,"12/08/19, 3:01:12 PM",Nikhil, Emily browning is surprisingly good in it
2623,"12/08/19, 3:01:38 PM",Nikhil, Also this storyline is somewhat different from the book and therefore a genuinely surprising part so maybe it‚Äôs that also
2624,"12/08/19, 3:01:52 PM",Nikhil, *it=American gods
2625,"12/08/19, 3:04:18 PM",Sush, ohh i'm curious
2626,"12/08/19, 3:04:27 PM",Sush, it's been 4-5 years since i've read the book
2627,"12/08/19, 3:04:59 PM",Nikhil, Show is fairly faithful otherwise and a tad overdramatized to be honest
2628,"12/08/19, 3:29:13 PM",Sush, ugh i'm trying to write the methods section of a proposal
2629,"12/08/19, 3:29:18 PM",Sush, and i'm soooooo bored
2630,"12/08/19, 3:29:36 PM",Sush, please remind me of this the next time i say 'MAYBE i'll just get a phd'
2631,"12/08/19, 3:30:13 PM",Sush," the book itself is a tad overdramatized, no? "
2632,"12/08/19, 3:30:35 PM",Nikhil, Lol true
2633,"12/08/19, 3:31:45 PM",Nikhil, How do these things go usually?
2634,"12/08/19, 3:32:29 PM",Sush," i mean, i just don't find writing papers interesting at all i think lol"
2635,"12/08/19, 3:32:56 PM",Sush, it's fine though - i'm just outlining some methods we're proposing to use to address a question
2636,"12/08/19, 3:34:37 PM",Sush, i'll typically draft it and my professor incorporates it into his narrative
2637,"12/08/19, 3:34:52 PM",Sush, he's a v compelling writer and an EXCELLENT speaker
2638,"12/08/19, 3:34:55 PM",Sush, he's so so good
2639,"12/08/19, 3:50:13 PM",Nikhil," Sounds not much worse than my job, at least"
2640,"12/08/19, 3:51:02 PM",Sush, yeah it really is not bad at all lol
2641,"12/08/19, 3:51:29 PM",Sush, it's just a BEAUTIFUL day outside and i'm dying to go to the beach
2642,"12/08/19, 3:51:58 PM",Nikhil," So, like, what would you do, really, at the beach?"
2643,"12/08/19, 3:52:30 PM",Sush, swim / read a book since i'd go by myself today
2644,"12/08/19, 3:52:37 PM",Nikhil," I ask because I live next to one, and of course it‚Äôs way too hot here, but it looks like everyone‚Äôs having so much fun there but I‚Äôm not sure if I would enjoy BEING there all that much"
2645,"12/08/19, 3:52:37 PM",Sush, i'm allowed to swim on my back lol
2646,"12/08/19, 3:53:10 PM",Nikhil," I plan on spending tomorrow morning at my gym + pool overlooking the beach, so I guess that‚Äôs close"
2647,"12/08/19, 3:53:16 PM",Sush, also i think i could stand in the water and let waves wash over my feet for like TWO HOURS without getting bored
2648,"12/08/19, 3:53:22 PM",Nikhil, Yeah?
2649,"12/08/19, 3:53:45 PM",Sush, yeah! i'll sometimes just walk to the water listening to a podcast and just let the waves come
2650,"12/08/19, 3:54:11 PM",Sush," it helps that it's not hot, for sure"
2651,"12/08/19, 3:54:23 PM",Sush, but it's also warm enough that the water feels great
2652,"12/08/19, 3:54:37 PM",Sush, ALSO it really helps that it is freshwater!
2653,"12/08/19, 3:54:46 PM",Nikhil, Lol fair
2654,"12/08/19, 3:55:03 PM",Sush, i could stop by the beach omw to work
2655,"12/08/19, 3:55:22 PM",Sush, i talked to my sister also today
2656,"12/08/19, 3:55:29 PM",Sush, about feeling like i'm in a rut etc
2657,"12/08/19, 3:55:42 PM",Sush, she strongly recommended a creative outlet lol
2658,"12/08/19, 3:55:52 PM",Sush, so i'm in the market for a HOBBY lol
2659,"12/08/19, 3:56:29 PM",Sush, i 100% feel this way about CONCERTS
2660,"12/08/19, 3:56:36 PM",Sush, like what do i do with my HANDS?
2661,"12/08/19, 3:56:47 PM",Nikhil, Haha I actually like concerts
2662,"12/08/19, 3:56:57 PM",Nikhil, Why do you have to do anything wirh your hands?
2663,"12/08/19, 3:57:10 PM",Nikhil, So I started doing morning pages today
2664,"12/08/19, 3:57:12 PM",Sush, they just lie by your side?
2665,"12/08/19, 3:57:21 PM",Nikhil, Sure?
2666,"12/08/19, 3:57:29 PM",Nikhil, Or dance if you want
2667,"12/08/19, 3:57:34 PM",Sush, ooh how was that?
2668,"12/08/19, 3:57:42 PM",Sush, but SO AWKWARD
2669,"12/08/19, 3:57:53 PM",Sush, i feel paralyzed lol
2670,"12/08/19, 3:57:58 PM",Nikhil, Depends on the music I think
2671,"12/08/19, 3:58:09 PM",Sush, this is why i like to go to kacheris in chennai 
2672,"12/08/19, 3:58:17 PM",Nikhil, Really just writing our random stuff in the morning
2673,"12/08/19, 3:58:29 PM",Nikhil, Was supposed to spur me to more creative output but didn‚Äôt entirely
2674,"12/08/19, 3:58:41 PM",Sush," you know what to do with your hands! and there's no need to perform your appreciation of the music or like, be sexy in the process idk"
2675,"12/08/19, 3:59:15 PM",Sush, concerts feel like a #hotgirl activity to me in a way i don't know how to participate lol
2676,"12/08/19, 4:00:05 PM",Sush, there'll probably be a few false starts!
2677,"12/08/19, 4:00:08 PM",Nikhil," So the hot girls etc are definitely part of the attraction of, if not concerts in general, music festivals, which is also a thing that I love even though I know it‚Äôs a bit cliche"
2678,"12/08/19, 4:00:45 PM",Sush, i don't think i've even been to a music festival
2679,"12/08/19, 4:00:53 PM",Sush, also 95% of the music i listen to is south asian
2680,"12/08/19, 4:00:58 PM",Sush, so i feel slightly fish out of water
2681,"12/08/19, 4:01:04 PM",Nikhil, Fair
2682,"12/08/19, 4:03:18 PM",Sush, I did tell a friend i'd go swing dancing with her next week!
2683,"12/08/19, 4:03:31 PM",Nikhil, That sounds fun!
2684,"12/08/19, 4:03:31 PM",Sush, it sounds low key and fun and there's a little lesson before
2685,"12/08/19, 4:03:55 PM",Nikhil, Swing is the only thing I remember from our dancing lessons
2686,"12/08/19, 4:04:10 PM",Nikhil, Also the easiest thing to dance to for a surprising number of songs
2687,"12/08/19, 4:04:10 PM",Sush, when did you take dancing lessons? 
2688,"12/08/19, 4:04:21 PM",Sush, so true!
2689,"12/08/19, 4:04:32 PM",Nikhil, Took a few with Mia in LA right after marriage
2690,"12/08/19, 4:04:47 PM",Nikhil," Ok, it‚Äôs 1 am and I planned to wake up early and gym etc"
2691,"12/08/19, 4:04:55 PM",Sush, so cute! i love that
2692,"12/08/19, 4:05:00 PM",Sush, this
2693,"12/08/19, 4:05:03 PM",Sush, not this
2694,"12/08/19, 4:05:07 PM",Nikhil, Lol
2695,"12/08/19, 4:05:09 PM",Sush," alrighty, ttyl!"
2696,"12/08/19, 4:05:20 PM",Nikhil, Gn!
2697,"12/08/19, 4:05:35 PM",Sush, üåøüåø
2698,"12/08/19, 4:05:41 PM",Nikhil, ?
2699,"15/08/19, 11:41:13 AM",Nikhil, So still not watching fleabag
2700,"15/08/19, 11:41:37 AM",Nikhil, But randomly tried marvelous Mrs Maisel and feel like I‚Äôm falling in love with Rachel Brosnahan
2701,"15/08/19, 11:55:36 AM",Sush, üòäüòä
2702,"15/08/19, 11:55:44 AM",Sush, i have mixed feelings about that show 
2703,"15/08/19, 11:55:58 AM",Sush, but yeah rachel brosnahan is pretty great!
2704,"15/08/19, 12:16:51 PM",Nikhil, What mixed feelings?
2705,"15/08/19, 12:18:08 PM",Sush, i think the writing around her has a lot of the same pitfalls as rory gilmore
2706,"15/08/19, 12:18:27 PM",Nikhil," That sounds very plausible, actually"
2707,"15/08/19, 12:18:27 PM",Sush," i liked s1 and then in s2, i was just tired"
2708,"15/08/19, 12:18:29 PM",Nikhil, Go on?
2709,"15/08/19, 12:18:38 PM",Nikhil, Ah. Still on episode 3
2710,"15/08/19, 12:18:43 PM",Sush, she has basically no losses
2711,"15/08/19, 12:18:53 PM",Sush, ok i won't spoiler!
2712,"15/08/19, 12:19:05 PM",Nikhil, Rory had losses no?
2713,"15/08/19, 12:19:10 PM",Sush, (is that a verb? it should be)
2714,"15/08/19, 12:19:16 PM",Nikhil, Also I‚Äôm kind of in the mood for unmitigated triumph
2715,"15/08/19, 12:19:21 PM",Sush, but they all ended up validating her in some way 
2716,"15/08/19, 12:19:35 PM",Nikhil, Hmm
2717,"15/08/19, 12:19:40 PM",Sush, jess broke up with you? he still loves you for changing his life
2718,"15/08/19, 12:19:46 PM",Nikhil, Lol
2719,"15/08/19, 12:19:59 PM",Sush, and their general disinterest in other women 
2720,"15/08/19, 12:20:25 PM",Nikhil, In the Netflix reboot the dude was basically engaged to someone else throughout
2721,"15/08/19, 12:20:28 PM",Nikhil, No?
2722,"15/08/19, 12:20:35 PM",Sush, he was
2723,"15/08/19, 12:20:40 PM",Sush, and still obsessed with her
2724,"15/08/19, 12:20:51 PM",Nikhil, Eh
2725,"15/08/19, 12:21:00 PM",Sush," oh, i mean logan"
2726,"15/08/19, 12:21:17 PM",Sush," he was still sleeping with her, still showing up in the middle of the night to surprise her"
2727,"15/08/19, 12:21:19 PM",Nikhil, Yes. I forgot the name
2728,"15/08/19, 12:21:28 PM",Sush, and _she_ said she wouldn't marry him
2729,"15/08/19, 12:21:35 PM",Nikhil, She did?
2730,"15/08/19, 12:21:45 PM",Sush, yeah - at the end of the original show
2731,"15/08/19, 12:21:47 PM",Nikhil," Confession, I gave up the original around season 4 or 5"
2732,"15/08/19, 12:21:51 PM",Sush, good call
2733,"15/08/19, 12:21:58 PM",Nikhil, Why?
2734,"15/08/19, 12:22:08 PM",Sush, why did she say no?
2735,"15/08/19, 12:22:17 PM",Sush, because she wanted to find herself something something
2736,"15/08/19, 12:22:31 PM",Nikhil, Of course
2737,"15/08/19, 12:22:45 PM",Sush, rory and midge are both not very nice women
2738,"15/08/19, 12:22:47 PM",Sush, which is fine
2739,"15/08/19, 12:23:04 PM",Sush, except that the show is screaming that they are
2740,"15/08/19, 12:23:13 PM",Sush, midge is still better than rory i think 
2741,"15/08/19, 12:23:21 PM",Nikhil, Midge seems kind of great so far actually
2742,"15/08/19, 12:23:43 PM",Nikhil, Rory seemed fundamentally nice if given to flights of fancy
2743,"15/08/19, 12:23:43 PM",Sush," she is in s1, actually!"
2744,"15/08/19, 12:23:52 PM",Sush," even in s2, she's mostly ok"
2745,"15/08/19, 12:24:01 PM",Sush, noooo rory is SO self-involved
2746,"15/08/19, 12:24:10 PM",Sush, and so 'i'm not like other girls'
2747,"15/08/19, 12:24:17 PM",Sush, that fat shaming sequence in the reboot
2748,"15/08/19, 12:24:27 PM",Sush, her disdain of the '30 something club'
2749,"15/08/19, 12:24:42 PM",Nikhil, Isn‚Äôt she 30 in the reboot? 
2750,"15/08/19, 12:24:58 PM",Nikhil, I clearly don‚Äôt remember that show as well as I thought I did
2751,"15/08/19, 12:27:34 PM",Sush, rory's the worrrst haha
2752,"15/08/19, 12:27:49 PM",Sush, she's a pretty terrible friend to Lane
2753,"15/08/19, 12:27:55 PM",Sush, give me Paris / Lane any day
2754,"15/08/19, 12:28:38 PM",Nikhil, Lane is the Asian chick?
2755,"15/08/19, 12:28:41 PM",Sush, yep
