[19/12/17, 12:10:59 AM] Sush: It was such an unsatisfactory conversation
[19/12/17, 12:11:35 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Oh no! :(
[19/12/17, 12:11:41 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Unsatisfactory in what sense?
[19/12/17, 12:12:04 AM] Sush: Like the gist of it was 'he's not that into you'
[19/12/17, 12:12:14 AM] Sush: And he's 100x into Valentina
[19/12/17, 12:12:18 AM] Sush: She has WRINKLES
[19/12/17, 12:12:24 AM] Sush: shows my biases Akron
[19/12/17, 12:12:27 AM] Sush: *also
[19/12/17, 12:12:35 AM] Sush: That it puzzles me
[19/12/17, 12:13:13 AM] Sush: I have increasing fear that no one ever will want me
[19/12/17, 12:13:24 AM] Sush: Fundamentally unloveable
[19/12/17, 12:13:40 AM] Pranathi Chicago: You are not unloveable. That is one hundred percent untrue
[19/12/17, 12:14:12 AM] Pranathi Chicago: You are absolutely lovely and charming and interesting and just because one dude decided not to date you anymore is NO reflection on you
[19/12/17, 12:14:21 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And you know that too
[19/12/17, 12:14:38 AM] Sush: But it's also true that people are just not into me
[19/12/17, 12:14:55 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Plus the fundamental incompatibility wasn't with you or anything about you. It was that you didn't want poly
[19/12/17, 12:15:11 AM] Sush: It was me only
[19/12/17, 12:15:13 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Which is completely within your rights to reject
[19/12/17, 12:15:18 AM] Sush: I told him admit you're not poly
[19/12/17, 12:15:29 AM] Sush: He said yes maybe you're right, I was unable to choose
[19/12/17, 12:15:39 AM] Sush: And was too selfish and lazy to force myself to choose
[19/12/17, 12:15:52 AM] Sush: So he chose her
[19/12/17, 12:15:55 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Dude do you realize what a piece of scum that makes him?
[19/12/17, 12:16:00 AM] Sush: That's basically what happened
[19/12/17, 12:16:10 AM] Sush: Like he said that in hindsight
[19/12/17, 12:16:14 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Instead of being angry at him you're upset that you're unloveable
[19/12/17, 12:16:41 AM] Pranathi Chicago: But still. That's fucked up
[19/12/17, 12:17:02 AM] Pranathi Chicago: To have played around with your emotions and assured you that it was all fine
[19/12/17, 12:17:05 AM] Pranathi Chicago: It enrages me
[19/12/17, 12:17:14 AM] Pranathi Chicago: You are absolutely loveable dude
[19/12/17, 12:17:22 AM] Sush: But he doesn't think so
[19/12/17, 12:17:32 AM] Sush: He chose someone 5000 miles away over me
[19/12/17, 12:17:34 AM] Sush: An Aunty
[19/12/17, 12:17:37 AM] Sush: With wrinkles
[19/12/17, 12:17:43 AM] Sush: Wtf is wrong with her
[19/12/17, 12:17:46 AM] Pranathi Chicago: So what? He's some dumbass child who's choosing instead to be in a relationship with someone there's no future with
[19/12/17, 12:17:49 AM] Sush: Carrying on this dalliance
[19/12/17, 12:17:49 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Because he's got issues
[19/12/17, 12:18:01 AM] Sush: Yeah :/
[19/12/17, 12:18:00 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And you've told me that yourself
[19/12/17, 12:18:07 AM] Sush: But no one is going to want me
[19/12/17, 12:18:19 AM] Sush: I'm not hideous or grumpy or mean
[19/12/17, 12:18:20 AM] Sush: Why?!
[19/12/17, 12:18:20 AM] Pranathi Chicago: That's patently untrue and you know that.
[19/12/17, 12:18:41 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Exactly. You're not any of those things. And even if you were, people like that find love
[19/12/17, 12:18:50 AM] Sush: :(
[19/12/17, 12:18:53 AM] Pranathi Chicago: There's no type of person who's inherently loveable
[19/12/17, 12:19:01 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I refuse to believe that that's true
[19/12/17, 12:19:03 AM] Sush: My heart has been beating fast again since yesterday
[19/12/17, 12:19:06 AM] Pranathi Chicago: It just isn't
[19/12/17, 12:19:21 AM] Pranathi Chicago: God I'm so fucking mad at him for contacting you again
[19/12/17, 12:19:38 AM] Pranathi Chicago: He had nothing to lose but didn't consider where you might be
[19/12/17, 12:19:42 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Bastard
‚Äé[19/12/17, 12:19:44 AM] Sush: ‚Äéimage omitted
[19/12/17, 12:20:01 AM] Sush: It's just like when he wanted to get back together with me
[19/12/17, 12:20:09 AM] Sush: He saw he wanted he had to have that's all
[19/12/17, 12:20:14 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Lol Rodrigo. Cuteeeee
[19/12/17, 12:20:22 AM] Sush: Isn't he the best üòçüòÇ
[19/12/17, 12:20:57 AM] Pranathi Chicago: How can you say that and let yourself feel unloveable at the same time?
[19/12/17, 12:21:06 AM] Sush: Rodrigo on Valentina "But her is more crazy. But she is a PhD in physics. Maybe she has never loved"
[19/12/17, 12:21:14 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Hahahahaha
[19/12/17, 12:21:26 AM] Pranathi Chicago: What does that mean!
[19/12/17, 12:21:43 AM] Sush: He thinks physics junta are crazy and are friends with the stars
[19/12/17, 12:22:45 AM] Sush: Because of that Dimitris
[19/12/17, 12:22:59 AM] Sush: Because ultimately he chose her
[19/12/17, 12:23:15 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Dude you're a goddamn QUEEN. You're crushing your course. You're a baller lady coder. You are extensively read, you're beautiful, you're funny. You don't need some dumbass child to tell you these things
[19/12/17, 12:23:33 AM] Sush: You're biased because you love me!!!
[19/12/17, 12:23:48 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I will tell you and for now that has to be enough. It definitely doesn't mean you won't hear it from some dumb man in the near future
[19/12/17, 12:23:58 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Haha why do you think I love you idiot?
[19/12/17, 12:24:00 AM] Sush: ‚ù§Ô∏è
[19/12/17, 12:24:02 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Because you're awesome
[19/12/17, 12:24:10 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I don't just randomly love everyone no?
[19/12/17, 12:24:19 AM] Sush: Fair üê≥‚ù§Ô∏è
[19/12/17, 12:24:31 AM] Sush: I feel hurt in a sort of removed way
[19/12/17, 12:24:39 AM] Sush: It doesn't feel crushing like it did earlier
[19/12/17, 12:24:42 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah the hurt I completely understand
[19/12/17, 12:24:50 AM] Sush: It's mostly a fear of what if I never love
[19/12/17, 12:25:01 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I still feel remotely in pain every time I think of Nick
[19/12/17, 12:25:10 AM] Sush: I can totally imagine!
[19/12/17, 12:25:23 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And I thought of him a lot in the two hours at immigration because that was the last time I was in line there
[19/12/17, 12:25:28 AM] Sush: and you guys were together so long
[19/12/17, 12:25:35 AM] Pranathi Chicago: When I was waiting to get to HP for him to break up with me again
[19/12/17, 12:25:42 AM] Sush: Oh man :(
[19/12/17, 12:25:45 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I'm just going to have to deal with it
[19/12/17, 12:25:52 AM] Pranathi Chicago: But it's better than it used to be
[19/12/17, 12:25:54 AM] Sush: Fucking Nick
[19/12/17, 12:25:59 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And it'll be better for you too
[19/12/17, 12:26:03 AM] Sush: Nick the Dick
[19/12/17, 12:26:24 AM] Sush: Sorry it sounded very angry in my head!!
[19/12/17, 12:26:36 AM] Sush: It looks frivolous in text
[19/12/17, 12:26:52 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Can't say when but maybe one day we'll stop feeling this constant sense of dull pain
[19/12/17, 12:27:05 AM] Sush: Ya I can't wait for it to stop
[19/12/17, 12:27:07 AM] Pranathi Chicago: With Suraj now I feel amusement more than anything
[19/12/17, 12:27:12 AM] Sush: Fair!
[19/12/17, 12:27:13 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Haha not at all frivolous
[19/12/17, 12:27:20 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Nick the Dick
[19/12/17, 12:27:21 AM] Sush: With Siddharth I just feel a sense of wasted time
[19/12/17, 12:27:30 AM] Sush: Wasted youth
[19/12/17, 12:27:48 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Mikhail the Dick-ail?

[19/12/17, 12:28:13 AM] Sush: Does that mean he is hitting on me lolol

[19/12/17, 12:34:32 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I saw him smoking and I asked for one
[19/12/17, 12:34:41 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Didn't even really want it but it was a great conversation starter
[19/12/17, 12:34:47 AM] Sush: üôåüèæüôåüèæüôåüèæ

[19/12/17, 12:35:14 AM] Pranathi Chicago: You know who I'm talking about?
[19/12/17, 12:35:24 AM] Pranathi Chicago: If you see him you'll immediately know
[19/12/17, 12:35:30 AM] Sush: I suppose!
[19/12/17, 12:35:34 AM] Pranathi Chicago: But he was UChicago undergrad and now does market research
[19/12/17, 12:35:46 AM] Pranathi Chicago: But also works for a think tank in Delhi

[19/12/17, 12:36:25 AM] Sush: No that's very good
[19/12/17, 12:36:25 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Unnecessary
[19/12/17, 12:36:51 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yes ah? Not desperate?
[19/12/17, 12:40:00 AM] Sush: No no
[19/12/17, 12:40:02 AM] Sush: Not at all
[19/12/17, 12:47:42 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Okay just reporting updates to you haha

[19/12/17, 1:11:14 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I really want to text Andrew and ask him why he didn't reply to me
[19/12/17, 1:11:21 AM] Sush: No!!!
[19/12/17, 1:11:24 AM] Sush: Delete number
[19/12/17, 1:11:31 AM] Pranathi Chicago: But I just want for closure
[19/12/17, 1:11:33 AM] Sush: His non response is response enough
[19/12/17, 1:11:34 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Not to rekindle
[19/12/17, 1:11:37 AM] Pranathi Chicago: It's driving me insane
[19/12/17, 1:11:49 AM] Pranathi Chicago: :(
[19/12/17, 1:12:02 AM] Sush: What will make you feel better to hear?
[19/12/17, 1:12:30 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I worry that he thinks I was too hasty and didn't give him a chance to even engage
[19/12/17, 1:12:37 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Like I just said bye
[19/12/17, 1:12:46 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Instead of raising the concern and waiting for a response
[19/12/17, 1:12:46 AM] Sush: You literally have him 100 chances
[19/12/17, 1:12:56 AM] Sush: You raised the concern multiple times
[19/12/17, 1:13:15 AM] Sush: And he could have responded to bye if he had wanted to
[19/12/17, 1:13:27 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I guess I just want to rage at him lol
[19/12/17, 1:13:49 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And ask him how the fuck he could disrespect someone so much that he wouldn't even respond
[19/12/17, 1:13:59 AM] Sush: I know :(
[19/12/17, 1:14:10 AM] Sush: It's really this new modality of dating
[19/12/17, 1:14:14 AM] Sush: Zero accountability
[19/12/17, 1:14:32 AM] Pranathi Chicago: But by texting him that don't I get it off my chest?
[19/12/17, 1:14:39 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And then have nothing to lose anyway
[19/12/17, 1:14:51 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Like he thinks I'm clingy already
[19/12/17, 1:14:53 AM] Sush: You're going to wait all over again for him to respond
[19/12/17, 1:15:00 AM] Sush: Why open it up again?
[19/12/17, 1:15:11 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah but what if he does
[19/12/17, 1:15:20 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Then maybe I'll feel better about this whole thing
[19/12/17, 1:15:27 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I'm still thinking about him anyway :(
[19/12/17, 1:15:29 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I'm so lame
[19/12/17, 1:16:15 AM] Sush: I just think there's nothing to be gained no?
[19/12/17, 1:16:27 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah you're right :(
[19/12/17, 1:16:52 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I just wish at least one of these idiots I've been involved with would show some modicum of remorse
[19/12/17, 1:17:14 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I think I am struggling with lack of closure on so many fronts
[19/12/17, 1:17:24 AM] Sush: I'm sure Nick feels like shit
[19/12/17, 1:17:36 AM] Sush: But is waaayyyy to egotistic to say so
[19/12/17, 1:18:09 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I don't think he does feel like shit. He's probably constructed some story in his head where I've deserved this
[19/12/17, 1:18:29 AM] Sush: I can't get rid of that rooster image
[19/12/17, 1:19:03 AM] Sush: He's in some wolf of Wall Street type trip no
[19/12/17, 1:19:29 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah he is
[19/12/17, 1:19:49 AM] Pranathi Chicago: He loves some movie about some young trader who makes it big
[19/12/17, 1:19:56 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Like that's his favorite movie
[19/12/17, 1:20:19 AM] Sush: Ughhh
[19/12/17, 1:20:25 AM] Sush: I'm all for being ambitious
[19/12/17, 1:20:31 AM] Sush: But that's kind of vulgar
[19/12/17, 1:20:38 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Right?
[19/12/17, 1:20:41 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Anyway
[19/12/17, 1:20:50 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I think I was going down a thought spiral with this Andrew
[19/12/17, 1:20:55 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Thanks for pulling me out of it
[19/12/17, 1:21:03 AM] Sush: 'Halt!'

[19/12/17, 1:22:00 AM] Pranathi Chicago: All the time I am feeling these days
[19/12/17, 1:22:07 AM] Sush: It is true
[19/12/17, 1:22:11 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I think because I was around all these happily married annoying as fuck people
[19/12/17, 1:22:18 AM] Sush: We're all so fundamentally alone
[19/12/17, 1:44:05 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah we are :(

[27/12/17, 10:13:25 PM] Pranathi Chicago: We met once for coffee

[27/12/17, 10:13:31 PM] Sush: ohhh
[27/12/17, 10:13:37 PM] Sush: did he seem nice and safe?
[27/12/17, 10:13:50 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah he was UChicago undergrad
[27/12/17, 10:13:55 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Not that that makes him safe or nice
[27/12/17, 10:14:00 PM] Pranathi Chicago: But he seemed okay only
[27/12/17, 10:14:03 PM] Sush: lolol
[27/12/17, 10:14:06 PM] Pranathi Chicago: But after what that Oliver told me
[27/12/17, 10:14:14 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I am feeling sexually underconfident
[27/12/17, 10:14:31 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Also I feel somewhat like I'm betraying Ajooni. Not like we're dating or anything but still
[27/12/17, 10:14:40 PM] Sush: nooo you'll get your mojo once you're there if you're into it
[27/12/17, 10:14:46 PM] Sush: oh hahaha
[27/12/17, 10:14:49 PM] Pranathi Chicago: But even this Ajooni thing I dunno if I made a big deal of it in my head
[27/12/17, 10:14:52 PM] Sush: do you _want_ to go?
[27/12/17, 10:15:03 PM] Pranathi Chicago: But with her not around, it feels very distant
[27/12/17, 10:15:23 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I think so? But lots of conflicted feelings.
[27/12/17, 10:15:35 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I think I am very confused in life right now.
[27/12/17, 10:15:49 PM] Sush: fair enough!
[27/12/17, 10:15:50 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I think I have become very very afraid of getting burnt
[27/12/17, 10:16:10 PM] Sush: odds of getting burnt by random dude are pretty low?
[27/12/17, 10:17:31 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah true
[27/12/17, 10:17:35 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I don't know let's see
[27/12/17, 10:17:52 PM] Pranathi Chicago: We were talking about sex things though and he said he likes it to be hairless down there
[27/12/17, 10:17:58 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Which I thought was a bad sign?
[27/12/17, 10:18:04 PM] Pranathi Chicago: That he felt like he could ask that already
[27/12/17, 10:18:12 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Or even make that a priority
[27/12/17, 10:18:16 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Sorry this is TMI :P
[27/12/17, 10:18:33 PM] Sush: hahahaa
[27/12/17, 10:18:48 PM] Sush: if it's going to be a 1 time thing doesn't matter
[27/12/17, 10:21:40 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah but I also don't want to shave down there just for some random hookup
[27/12/17, 10:21:50 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Like I would have to get into the shower now and shave my legs and pubic hair
[27/12/17, 10:21:56 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Which feels like a lot of effort for a hookup
[27/12/17, 10:23:45 PM] Sush: Correct
[27/12/17, 10:23:53 PM] Sush: Abba painful
[27/12/17, 10:24:02 PM] Pranathi Chicago: So I decided I'll just meet him at Jimmy's
[27/12/17, 10:24:05 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Low key hang
[27/12/17, 10:24:09 PM] Pranathi Chicago: No need for sex now
[27/12/17, 10:24:12 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I'm not totally sure
[27/12/17, 10:24:13 PM] Sush: Smart
[27/12/17, 10:24:17 PM] Pranathi Chicago: That I want to have sex with him
[27/12/17, 10:24:23 PM] Sush: Good call
[27/12/17, 10:24:24 PM] Pranathi Chicago: He has a mustache
[27/12/17, 10:24:35 PM] Sush: Hahaha is that a turn off for you
[27/12/17, 10:24:40 PM] Sush: üòÇ
[27/12/17, 10:24:51 PM] Pranathi Chicago: When I say he has a mustache
[27/12/17, 10:24:58 PM] Pranathi Chicago: He has like one of those Rajasthani level mustaches
[27/12/17, 10:25:05 PM] Sush: That's awesome üòÇ
[27/12/17, 10:25:14 PM] Sush: Like shikhar Dhawan?
[27/12/17, 10:25:22 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah exactly like that!
[27/12/17, 10:25:29 PM] Pranathi Chicago: He was inspired when he went to Rajasthan it seems
[27/12/17, 10:25:31 PM] Sush: Very trendy üòÖüòÖüòÖ
[27/12/17, 10:25:35 PM] Sush: Lolol
[27/12/17, 10:25:38 PM] Sush: Omg
[27/12/17, 10:25:51 PM] Pranathi Chicago: See why I'm hesitant HA?
[27/12/17, 10:26:34 PM] Sush: üòÇüòÇüòÇ
[27/12/17, 10:26:39 PM] Sush: Jimmy's is a good idea
[27/12/17, 10:26:48 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah. :P
[27/12/17, 10:27:00 PM] Sush: also so cold I imagine
[27/12/17, 10:27:18 PM] Sush: I feel like my coat won't suffice
[27/12/17, 10:27:21 PM] Sush: #sigh
[27/12/17, 10:28:37 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah I think you'll have to get a heavier coat. My coat feels too light and it's probably on the thicker end
[27/12/17, 11:15:27 PM] Sush: Ugh gross
[28/12/17, 11:58:32 AM] Sush: Pranathi!
[28/12/17, 11:58:38 AM] Sush: I have a question
[28/12/17, 11:59:05 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yes ask off!
[28/12/17, 11:59:14 AM] Sush: I haaaaaaate my house
[28/12/17, 11:59:23 AM] Sush: And Sneha hasn't found a subletter
[28/12/17, 11:59:56 AM] Sush: Do you think it would be out of line to ask her to give it to me at half rent until spring after which I can pay her the regular sublet rent
[28/12/17, 12:00:13 PM] Sush: She's also been saying she can't bring herself to hunt for a renter
[28/12/17, 12:00:30 PM] Sush: Because I'd have to pay rent for both houses for Feb and march otherwise
[28/12/17, 12:00:36 PM] Sush: Which I obv can't afford
[28/12/17, 12:01:05 PM] Sush: Means I'll suggest only
[28/12/17, 12:01:13 PM] Sush: She can easily say no
[28/12/17, 12:04:12 PM] Sush: Tell toooo
[28/12/17, 12:04:27 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Sorry I'm at these family friends' house
[28/12/17, 12:04:32 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Just one sec, so sorry!
[28/12/17, 12:05:05 PM] Sush: Hahahaha cool cool take ur time!!!!
[28/12/17, 12:05:30 PM] Sush: I'm just being annoying
[28/12/17, 12:05:36 PM] Sush: Not actually an emergency!
[28/12/17, 12:08:42 PM] Pranathi Chicago: No it's not out of line at all
[28/12/17, 12:08:43 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I would ask her
[28/12/17, 12:08:47 PM] Pranathi Chicago: No's are free!
[28/12/17, 12:08:54 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And I don't think she'll get upset with you
[28/12/17, 12:09:13 PM] Pranathi Chicago: She knows subletting is not a guarantee that that rentee will pay full price
[28/12/17, 12:09:25 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Plus even if she gets upset, whatevs
[28/12/17, 12:30:39 PM] Sush: That is correct
[28/12/17, 11:18:28 PM] Sush: Hii
[28/12/17, 11:18:36 PM] Sush: It won't suck no?
[28/12/17, 11:18:39 PM] Sush: To return?

[28/12/17, 11:20:42 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I worry that I've betrayed Ajooni or something lol. Why do I feel this way
[28/12/17, 11:20:49 PM] Pranathi Chicago: But also I really wanted to have sex
[28/12/17, 11:21:38 PM] Sush: Chee no betrayal

[28/12/17, 11:51:13 PM] Sush: I said ok why disabuse him of that idea
[28/12/17, 11:51:31 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Haha it's pretty close to it in theory

[30/12/17, 5:12:08 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Listen, my conscience is killing me
[30/12/17, 5:12:09 PM] Pranathi Chicago: About Ajooni
[30/12/17, 5:12:16 PM] Pranathi Chicago: It's fine I slept with that other dude no?
[30/12/17, 5:12:23 PM] Pranathi Chicago: We agreed we wouldn't be in a relationship or anything
[30/12/17, 5:12:28 PM] Sush: About Medici dude?
[30/12/17, 5:12:29 PM] Sush: Ohh
[30/12/17, 5:12:33 PM] Sush: No it's fine!
[30/12/17, 5:12:39 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Pakka?
[30/12/17, 5:12:41 PM] Sush: Don't have to feel guilty
[30/12/17, 5:12:44 PM] Sush: Yep yep
[30/12/17, 5:12:52 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Because I spoke with Sneha and she sort of made me feel like I need to talk to her about it
[30/12/17, 5:12:59 PM] Pranathi Chicago: But I don't see why because it would only make her feel bad
[30/12/17, 5:13:03 PM] Sush: Don't have to be exclusive unless you want to and talked about it
[30/12/17, 5:13:12 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And it's not like we're really committed to each other in that sense. We've only said there are feelings
[30/12/17, 5:13:17 PM] Sush: Correct
[30/12/17, 5:13:20 PM] Pranathi Chicago: We haven't even spent more than a week in each others' company!
[30/12/17, 5:13:24 PM] Sush: You don't owe anything at this point
[30/12/17, 5:13:26 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Seems silly to rush into anything
[30/12/17, 5:13:28 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Okay good
[30/12/17, 5:13:34 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Thank god you're sage and wise
[30/12/17, 5:13:35 PM] Sush: You have both just expressed interest
[30/12/17, 5:13:47 PM] Sush: And you're seeing where it's going
[30/12/17, 5:13:51 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Did you get some sleep on the flight to AD?
[30/12/17, 5:13:54 PM] Sush: üòÇüòò

[30/12/17, 5:15:24 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I don't know if this is racial profiling or not
[30/12/17, 5:17:34 PM] Sush: Hahaha
[30/12/17, 5:17:44 PM] Sush: I had a Pakistani dude last time
[30/12/17, 5:17:47 PM] Sush: He was v sweet
[30/12/17, 5:17:54 PM] Sush: But otherwise ya Indians only
[30/12/17, 5:17:58 PM] Sush: Could still be racial
[30/12/17, 5:19:55 PM] Pranathi Chicago: No? Some sort of desi. Even when I was coming back from HK, where there were so few Indians to begin with, I got an Indian couple
[30/12/17, 5:20:02 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Okay have a safe flight and text me when you land!
[30/12/17, 5:20:11 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I'm going to that rapper Noname's concert tonight with Ajooni's friend Eve

[30/12/17, 5:28:11 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah very nice lyrical stuff.
[30/12/17, 5:28:17 PM] Sush: Noname is a great name
[30/12/17, 5:28:18 PM] Pranathi Chicago: She's almost a beat poet
[30/12/17, 5:28:32 PM] Sush: My family plays a card game that no one knows the name of
[30/12/17, 5:28:36 PM] Pranathi Chicago: No? She used to go by Noname Gypsy but now she's just Noname. Packs a punch

[06/01/18, 12:06:32 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I don't know if I'm doing that great

[06/01/18, 12:09:12 AM] Sush: Maybe you should move to Sneha's and give me your studio hahah
[06/01/18, 12:09:36 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Sometimes when I'm encountering all these other people and they also turn out to be dicks, I wonder if Nick was the best I'll ever get
[06/01/18, 12:10:05 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Because I truly believe we loved each other at one point in time. I don't think I'll ever feel that love with abandon again
[06/01/18, 12:10:22 AM] Sush: You will, I promise you.
[06/01/18, 12:10:43 AM] Sush: I find it hard to convince myself too sometimes, but it's true.

[06/01/18, 12:11:12 AM] Sush: It's the change of routine that's also so bewildering
[06/01/18, 12:11:34 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah I miss having him around
[06/01/18, 12:11:41 AM] Pranathi Chicago: He was a very warm presence

[06/01/18, 12:11:51 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Maybe I'm just cold
[06/01/18, 12:12:00 AM] Pranathi Chicago: That's why all these emotions

[19/01/18, 3:45:25 PM] Sush: i respond with all my surface emotions lol
[19/01/18, 3:45:40 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Haha well at least this way you know you're getting a super honest response
[19/01/18, 3:45:50 PM] Sush: true
[19/01/18, 3:45:52 PM] Pranathi Chicago: But I'm more like you for sure
[19/01/18, 3:45:58 PM] Sush: an honest ovi is a little scary haha
[19/01/18, 3:46:14 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Haha I can see that. She is so serious
[19/01/18, 3:46:48 PM] Sush: i'm also thinking of that article about being single
[19/01/18, 3:47:21 PM] Sush: i don't mean this as an indictment - but they both shifted the focus of their emotional resources to their partners
[19/01/18, 3:47:28 PM] Sush: and i wasn't ready for that
[19/01/18, 3:47:41 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah, dyadic withdrawal
[19/01/18, 3:48:05 PM] Sush: yeah - i think i'm having a response to that loss
[19/01/18, 3:48:07 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I definitely think we are not taught scripts for how to balance a partner with a life surrounded by friends
[19/01/18, 3:48:15 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I know I'm guilty of doing it too
[19/01/18, 3:48:32 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Of course. I felt it with Swetha too
[19/01/18, 3:48:35 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And Nitya
[19/01/18, 3:48:47 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I'm sure I inflicted that on them
[19/01/18, 3:49:06 PM] Sush: i guess it's natural also
[19/01/18, 3:49:12 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I wonder how we might figure out how to do the balance better
[19/01/18, 3:49:17 PM] Sush: these people are _family_ now

[19/01/18, 3:49:30 PM] Sush: i thought i was too
[19/01/18, 3:49:54 PM] Pranathi Chicago: We end up privileging relationships that can eventually be institutionalized in ways like marriage no?
[19/01/18, 3:50:15 PM] Sush: i don't know because i've never been in a real relationship
[19/01/18, 3:50:28 PM] Pranathi Chicago: As though that brings us legitimacy in the eyes of our parents or family or whatever. Like that's a socially *valid* retreating or something?
[19/01/18, 3:51:04 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah it's not kind to our original support system
[19/01/18, 3:51:13 PM] Pranathi Chicago: It's so hurtful

[19/01/18, 3:52:05 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I think that so often about you
[19/01/18, 3:54:08 PM] Sush: I can be awful too!
[19/01/18, 3:54:18 PM] Sush: Clearly cheth and I were terrible to each other
[19/01/18, 3:54:57 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah, but you invest in friendships

[20/01/18, 5:18:32 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Also
[20/01/18, 5:18:44 PM] Pranathi Chicago: This Juliet wants us to go rollerblading today
[20/01/18, 5:18:47 PM] Pranathi Chicago: It scares the fuck out of me
[20/01/18, 5:18:51 PM] Sush: Hahahah

[20/01/18, 5:18:59 PM] Sush: It does seeem v scary
[20/01/18, 5:19:04 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah no?
[20/01/18, 5:19:09 PM] Pranathi Chicago: This is something I resent Indian parents for
[20/01/18, 5:19:13 PM] Sush: Juliet is herpes girl?
[20/01/18, 5:19:23 PM] Pranathi Chicago: For not giving us the cultural capital to be strong about doing things with our bodies
[20/01/18, 5:19:27 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Like physical activity
[20/01/18, 5:19:34 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yep that girl

[20/01/18, 5:20:40 PM] Sush: And all 'exercise' pitched at women is to lose weight for shaadi
[20/01/18, 5:20:44 PM] Sush: Only calorie burning
[20/01/18, 5:20:50 PM] Sush: No strength, skill
[20/01/18, 5:20:53 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah disgusting.
[20/01/18, 5:21:03 PM] Pranathi Chicago: So superficial
[20/01/18, 5:21:17 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I want to make my kids do crazy amounts of physical activity
[20/01/18, 5:21:22 PM] Sush: Ya
[20/01/18, 5:21:28 PM] Sush: Send them running around all the time
[20/01/18, 5:21:54 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And make them not afraid to fall down
[20/01/18, 5:22:02 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I feel like my parents made me so scared of falling down
[20/01/18, 5:22:09 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Even ice skating I can't do for that reason
[20/01/18, 5:22:15 PM] Sush: Although I guess on Indian roads you need to be more afraid of falling down
[20/01/18, 5:22:30 PM] Sush: These roads are almost sterile in comparison
[20/01/18, 5:22:35 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah that's true
[20/01/18, 5:22:39 PM] Sush: There won't be trash and glass pieces

[20/01/18, 5:22:55 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Kids here are so coddled in those ways
[20/01/18, 5:22:59 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Like I remember this one time
[20/01/18, 5:22:59 PM] Sush: So many tetanus injections in life
[20/01/18, 5:23:09 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Nick and I were walking home and one plastic bag flew across the road
[20/01/18, 5:23:13 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I didn't even think about it twice
[20/01/18, 5:23:15 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Barely saw it
[20/01/18, 5:23:18 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And he went ballistic
[20/01/18, 5:23:27 PM] Pranathi Chicago: About how there's trash floating around and this is unhygienic
[20/01/18, 5:23:36 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I was like lol, please never come to India
[20/01/18, 5:23:44 PM] Sush: Lolol
[20/01/18, 5:23:55 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I used to worry about that SO much. That he would be completely grossed out when he came to India and I would hate him for it
[20/01/18, 5:28:24 PM] Sush: He probably would have been!
[20/01/18, 5:28:48 PM] Sush: Omg bus came and went
[20/01/18, 5:29:20 PM] Sush: On its own

[20/01/18, 5:33:01 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Haha
[20/01/18, 5:33:12 PM] Pranathi Chicago: That would be my answer to "what does optimism feel like?"
[20/01/18, 5:33:14 PM] Pranathi Chicago: :P
[20/01/18, 5:33:36 PM] Sush: üòÇ
[20/01/18, 5:33:46 PM] Sush: I want a snack give idea pls

[20/01/18, 5:35:31 PM] Pranathi Chicago: You don't like avocado no?
[20/01/18, 5:35:54 PM] Sush: I love it!
[20/01/18, 5:36:03 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Oh you do, good

[20/01/18, 5:36:14 PM] Pranathi Chicago: You come home we'll make
[20/01/18, 5:36:19 PM] Sush: Yessss done
[20/01/18, 5:36:22 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Nick and I used to make these amazing sweet potato tacos
[20/01/18, 5:36:29 PM] Sush: I want to make quesadilla
[20/01/18, 5:36:36 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Oh yes, good idea
[20/01/18, 5:36:49 PM] Sush: Sounds yummm
[20/01/18, 5:39:47 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah
[20/01/18, 5:39:51 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I miss his company :/
[20/01/18, 5:40:03 PM] Pranathi Chicago: He was an asshole at the end but when he wasn't, he was so lovely to hang out with
[20/01/18, 5:40:15 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Ready to do anything, just contented with whatever
[20/01/18, 5:40:48 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Oh btw! I saw Erin's status message
[20/01/18, 5:40:52 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Where did she get PhD admit?
[20/01/18, 5:48:06 PM] Sush: I can imagine :(
[20/01/18, 5:48:12 PM] Sush: Ohhhh Ohio state!!!!

[20/01/18, 6:00:49 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And hahaha. Your bus situation is cracking me up
[20/01/18, 6:00:55 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Why even go if you don't want to? :P
[20/01/18, 6:00:58 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Go to a cafe and sit no
[20/01/18, 6:01:04 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Fabiana's or something
[20/01/18, 6:02:27 PM] Sush: üòÇ
[20/01/18, 6:02:36 PM] Sush: I don't want to spend $ lol

[20/01/18, 6:02:49 PM] Sush: But I do want Maggi lol
[20/01/18, 6:04:24 PM] Sush: This Rodrigo is organising trip to Mexico
[20/01/18, 6:04:27 PM] Sush: In spring break
[20/01/18, 6:04:36 PM] Sush: Jessy wants to go kk
[20/01/18, 6:04:53 PM] Sush: Oh your Rustom also
[20/01/18, 6:05:44 PM] Pranathi Chicago: LOL
[20/01/18, 6:05:49 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I never met him after all :P
[20/01/18, 6:05:54 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Seems like number one flake
[20/01/18, 6:05:59 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Are you going to go?
[20/01/18, 6:06:13 PM] Sush: Nooo
[20/01/18, 6:06:19 PM] Sush: I don't like that group particularly
[20/01/18, 6:06:38 PM] Sush: Jessy and Dimitris and all
[20/01/18, 6:06:40 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Oh you don't like J?
[20/01/18, 6:06:43 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I thought you were best friends
[20/01/18, 6:06:48 PM] Sush: üòÖ
[20/01/18, 6:06:54 PM] Sush: That's just you
[20/01/18, 6:06:59 PM] Sush: I can handle weird
[20/01/18, 6:07:05 PM] Sush: But these are batshitcrazy people
[20/01/18, 6:07:06 PM] Pranathi Chicago: That Dimitris also looks so creepy
[20/01/18, 6:07:09 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Hahaha
[20/01/18, 6:07:18 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I keep seeing him around campus
[20/01/18, 6:07:25 PM] Sush: Yaaa what a weirdo
[20/01/18, 6:07:37 PM] Sush: Rodrigo says he's weird not creepy
[20/01/18, 6:07:39 PM] Sush: I disagree
[20/01/18, 6:07:43 PM] Sush: He's sooooo creepy
[20/01/18, 6:07:45 PM] Sush: And awkward
[20/01/18, 6:07:48 PM] Sush: It's painful
[20/01/18, 6:07:53 PM] Sush: Jessy is painfully awkward
[20/01/18, 6:08:19 PM] Sush: I think Rustom is pretty stuck up!
[20/01/18, 6:08:41 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah Rostam seems kind of stuck up.
[20/01/18, 6:08:54 PM] Sush: Yaaaa I'm like first of all you're 23
[20/01/18, 6:08:55 PM] Pranathi Chicago: But yeah these other two are just plain bizarro
[20/01/18, 6:09:00 PM] Sush: Calm down you don't know everything
[20/01/18, 6:09:12 PM] Sush: Yeah üòÇ
[20/01/18, 6:10:22 PM] Sush: I think this Rustom sees himself as being very _wordly_
[20/01/18, 6:10:28 PM] Sush: Worldly lol
[20/01/18, 6:10:35 PM] Sush: So much for my italicisation
[20/01/18, 6:10:39 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Hahaha.
[20/01/18, 6:10:47 PM] Pranathi Chicago: This worldly thing is one interesting identity
[20/01/18, 6:11:08 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I know other people too who I think characterize themselves as worldly, and I wonder what it is about that that makes people think it's appealing
[20/01/18, 6:11:26 PM] Sush: Ya! It makes me feel inadequate sometimes lol - it has become a thing in my head that I've 'never gone abroad'
[20/01/18, 6:11:38 PM] Sush: *it had
[20/01/18, 6:12:04 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Ahh really? Yeah I remember even Tara saying that
[20/01/18, 6:12:20 PM] Sush: Ya!
[20/01/18, 6:12:21 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Dude i'm bored
[20/01/18, 6:12:25 PM] Sush: Esp wit JPAL junta
[20/01/18, 6:12:26 PM] Pranathi Chicago: They're playing video games
[20/01/18, 6:12:30 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I can just leave no
[20/01/18, 6:12:34 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Oh they're very snobby ah
[20/01/18, 6:12:35 PM] Sush: 80% of them were foreign educated
[20/01/18, 6:12:55 PM] Sush: And they'd all talk like 'you _must_ eat the trout in Malta'
[20/01/18, 6:13:14 PM] Sush: I'd be like ya the dosa in Udupi is v nice and feel provincial and uncool
[20/01/18, 6:13:40 PM] Pranathi Chicago: HAHA what fartbags
[20/01/18, 6:13:45 PM] Sush: üòÇ
[20/01/18, 6:13:55 PM] Sush: I guess this is how older women talk maybe idk
[20/01/18, 6:14:10 PM] Sush: Even the younger ones would be like they went backpacking in Argentina
[20/01/18, 6:14:16 PM] Sush: I was fresh out of insti
[20/01/18, 6:14:22 PM] Sush: I only went home for holidays
[20/01/18, 6:14:43 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Hmm are they all from super loaded families?
[20/01/18, 6:14:57 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Being in this house no? I am reminded of what a frugal upbringing we had in the U.S.
[20/01/18, 6:15:06 PM] Sush: Ya! That was one of my big realisations in development
[20/01/18, 6:15:35 PM] Pranathi Chicago: They never made us feel like we didn't have much, but seeing houses like this I'm realizing
[20/01/18, 6:15:44 PM] Sush: It was wrong for me because everyone else was super rich already and didn't to support families eventually on this salary because lol no not possible
[20/01/18, 6:15:52 PM] Sush: I can imagine!!
[20/01/18, 6:16:08 PM] Sush: Parents are uchicago?
[20/01/18, 6:16:39 PM] Sush: For many people, their salary was pocket money
[20/01/18, 6:16:53 PM] Sush: About 50% were like us only
[20/01/18, 6:16:53 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah that's true. It's so hard not to compare though. Whenever I went to Tara's house, I would feel really weird about inviting her over to mine. And they were also the kinds that had the driver for every small excursion
[20/01/18, 6:17:00 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah profs at UChicago
[20/01/18, 6:17:01 PM] Sush: Like, making a living off this
[20/01/18, 6:17:02 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Booth
[20/01/18, 6:17:10 PM] Sush: Ohhh fanceee
[20/01/18, 6:17:19 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Oh I hadn't realized that's what JPal kids were like
[20/01/18, 6:17:30 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I assumed it was a job for everyone
[20/01/18, 6:17:38 PM] Pranathi Chicago: But I guess I knew only you and Suraj
[20/01/18, 6:17:41 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And other insti junta
[20/01/18, 6:17:47 PM] Sush: They all worked super hard at it
[20/01/18, 6:17:58 PM] Sush: And were v good at what they did
[20/01/18, 6:18:10 PM] Sush: But it was totally ok that it wouldn't eventually be enough money
[20/01/18, 6:18:20 PM] Sush: It was more than enough for 1 person
[20/01/18, 6:18:32 PM] Sush: V comfortable, I even managed to save a bit and invest a bit
[20/01/18, 6:18:42 PM] Sush: But the moment it isn't just you, nowhere near enough
[20/01/18, 6:19:03 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah I can imagine.
[20/01/18, 6:19:11 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I have never done that before and I wish I had
[20/01/18, 6:19:18 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Like saved up some cash just to not have any savings at all
[20/01/18, 6:19:43 PM] Sush: It's practically meaningless to save up in rupees tho if you're living in America
[20/01/18, 6:19:47 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I realize with this PhD thing it's very paycheck to paycheck, especially with teaching subsidizing my stipend now
[20/01/18, 6:19:51 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah that's also true
[20/01/18, 6:20:09 PM] Sush: You'll put fight and save 1000-2000
[20/01/18, 6:20:25 PM] Sush: It takes time to save that in inr
[20/01/18, 6:21:03 PM] Sush: Ya in 2 years I saved about 2k
[20/01/18, 6:21:06 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah. When people here say they came from poor families, some of them really did, but others just mean they weren't *as rich*.
[20/01/18, 6:21:14 PM] Sush: It felt big then - > 1 lakh!
[20/01/18, 6:21:20 PM] Sush: Now I'm like oh
[20/01/18, 6:21:21 PM] Pranathi Chicago: It is big
[20/01/18, 6:21:28 PM] Pranathi Chicago: We just think in different currency now
[20/01/18, 6:21:37 PM] Pranathi Chicago: For India that's a lot. You could do a bunch with that
[20/01/18, 6:21:41 PM] Sush: Correct
[20/01/18, 6:21:50 PM] Sush: Ya I can be unemployed for 3 months with that
[20/01/18, 6:22:07 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah for sure.
[20/01/18, 6:22:09 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Had maggi?
[20/01/18, 6:22:14 PM] Sush: No lol
[20/01/18, 6:22:37 PM] Sush: I'm eating strawberries and maple syrup
[20/01/18, 6:22:40 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Mmmm
[20/01/18, 6:22:53 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yem yem
[20/01/18, 6:23:01 PM] Sush: And heating up a little frozen waffle
[20/01/18, 6:23:12 PM] Sush: Big snack
[20/01/18, 6:23:48 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yum. I should get frozen waffles
[20/01/18, 6:23:52 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I love waffles
[20/01/18, 6:23:55 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I'd just eat that all day long
[20/01/18, 6:26:45 PM] Sush: Yes!!
[20/01/18, 6:26:55 PM] Sush: I got these Kashi multi grain waffles
[20/01/18, 6:27:06 PM] Sush: They are only 70 calories each!
[20/01/18, 6:27:16 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Oh man but that Kashi granola I got tastes like shit
[20/01/18, 6:27:17 PM] Sush: And have some extra fibre and all
[20/01/18, 6:27:20 PM] Sush: Ohhh
[20/01/18, 6:27:23 PM] Sush: Haven't had that
[20/01/18, 6:27:39 PM] Sush: But with fruit and maple syrup the waffle just becomes a vehicle
[20/01/18, 6:28:58 PM] Pranathi Chicago: That's true
[20/01/18, 6:29:04 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I got dried cranberries
[20/01/18, 6:29:04 PM] Pranathi Chicago: To put in my oatmeal
[20/01/18, 6:29:08 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And mix with nuts as a snack
[20/01/18, 6:29:15 PM] Sush: Yum!
[20/01/18, 6:29:22 PM] Sush: I want a pori snackkk
[20/01/18, 6:29:41 PM] Pranathi Chicago: We should get pori from Metro and make bhel puri
[20/01/18, 6:29:46 PM] Sush: Yessss
[20/01/18, 6:29:53 PM] Sush: I'll make date and tamarind chutney
[20/01/18, 6:30:02 PM] Sush: And green chutney
[20/01/18, 6:30:08 PM] Sush: can't wait to move lol

[20/01/18, 7:25:56 PM] Sush: [7:18 PM, 1/20/2018] Chenji Bangalore: You two got that bonnie and Clyde disposition, a position we admire with no conditions, if the mission is love, let it drizzle like it's always insufficient
I see this vision, that you reciprocate and you listen, a lifetime of happiness punctuated by intelligence
You show the legions, gathered here that courtship is easy, make it seem like a breeze for those that struggle to release, that sense of sharing,
Man, time flies and we continue to smile, how quickly all the years go by
Sometimes I wonder how we got away from all the hustle and the debauchery,
Appreciate how we went from clinking bottles on rooftops to raising glasses on anniversaries

Shower some love on these two beautiful people, they're writing a new story that's about to begin
I know you see them grinning like they can't wait to enact the original sin
I'm glad we assembled here, to witness that glow from within
All your blessings for this couple, yall, say it loud now, #Chetforthevin

[28/01/18, 2:31:29 PM] Sush: Sorry I hung up abruptly!

[28/01/18, 2:53:53 PM] Sush: Very nice name
[28/01/18, 2:53:59 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah seriously, we could crush him

[28/01/18, 2:55:57 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Looks amazing!!
[28/01/18, 2:56:16 PM] Sush: He said it looks great but you know more about authenticity of Indian food
[28/01/18, 2:56:20 PM] Sush: üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
[28/01/18, 2:56:28 PM] Sush: Guess that's my answer o

[29/01/18, 10:28:46 AM] Sush: I have class :(
[29/01/18, 10:30:33 AM] Sush: At 11:30
[29/01/18, 10:29:48 AM] Pranathi Chicago: :(
[29/01/18, 10:29:49 AM] Pranathi Chicago: When?
[29/01/18, 10:31:08 AM] Sush: #sigh
[29/01/18, 10:31:10 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Ahh there's still time though
[29/01/18, 10:31:16 AM] Pranathi Chicago: So boring :/
[29/01/18, 10:31:24 AM] Sush: Indeeeed
[29/01/18, 10:33:30 AM] Sush: I kinda want to work out of a cafe downtown
[29/01/18, 10:34:44 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Ooh, do it!

[29/01/18, 10:35:26 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Which cafe?
[29/01/18, 10:35:53 AM] Sush: Maybe just dollop on Dearborn
[29/01/18, 12:08:13 PM] Sush: dude
[29/01/18, 12:08:28 PM] Sush: i think i made faux pas by making fun of shehla rashid!
[29/01/18, 12:08:47 PM] Sush: in front of self proclaimed commie junta
[29/01/18, 12:09:10 PM] Sush: but that kaamil irritated me in the beginning something he asked about where my job offer was from etc
[29/01/18, 12:09:37 PM] Sush: and then before i could explain properly also he went on a rant about neoliberal econ models  - "not that i can't understand but I JUST DON'T CARE"
[29/01/18, 12:09:45 PM] Sush: yaar i also don't care about your fish
[29/01/18, 12:09:46 PM] Sush: now what
[29/01/18, 12:09:58 PM] Sush: but i'm listening politely no
[29/01/18, 1:09:53 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Sorry! Was working, just saw this
[29/01/18, 1:10:07 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Ehh it's okay. I can't even remember what you said about her
[29/01/18, 1:10:43 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I don't think they'll care either. I think when you declared yourself firmly as Econ student at UChicago, they realized you weren't posturing to be a commie, which lets you off the hook imo
[29/01/18, 1:11:09 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I can't believe Kamil said that about your work. That's just fucking rude
[29/01/18, 1:11:41 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Take your political ideologies and shove it up your ass, Kamil
[29/01/18, 1:11:41 PM] Pranathi Chicago: *ideology

[29/01/18, 2:37:16 PM] Sush: Sorry just saw thisss
[29/01/18, 3:19:14 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Did you notice that the girl sitting opposite you has our green sweater??
[29/01/18, 3:33:24 PM] Sush: Yesssss

[29/01/18, 3:48:39 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Dude I feel like i've put on a ton of weight
[29/01/18, 3:48:45 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I've been eating so much junk of late
[29/01/18, 3:48:51 PM] Sush: SAAAMMEEE
[29/01/18, 3:48:57 PM] Sush: you _look_ no different tho
[29/01/18, 3:49:10 PM] Pranathi Chicago: That's because you see me everyday
[29/01/18, 3:49:21 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I think it's harder to tell :(
[29/01/18, 3:49:44 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I keep thinking I should exercise but it just requires so much... effort
[29/01/18, 3:49:47 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I am SO lazy lol
[29/01/18, 4:59:30 PM] Sush: ugh working on my thesis increases  my heart rate!
[29/01/18, 4:59:40 PM] Sush: i think my extra anxiety is because of thesis
[29/01/18, 4:59:45 PM] Sush: i don't know how to not psych myself out
[29/01/18, 4:59:45 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Take a deep breath!
[29/01/18, 4:59:52 PM] Sush: I HATE WRITING PAPERS
[29/01/18, 5:01:10 PM] Sush: sorry capital letters are v obnoxious
[29/01/18, 5:22:06 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Sorry
[29/01/18, 5:22:21 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I got caught up trying to write some sentence and tied myself into knots lol
[29/01/18, 5:22:25 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I hear you so hard
[29/01/18, 5:22:40 PM] Sush: Npppp
[29/01/18, 5:22:47 PM] Sush: Sorry I'm being whinyyy
[29/01/18, 5:22:51 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Set Pomodoro timer
[29/01/18, 5:22:54 PM] Sush: Maybe I should go back to therapy
[29/01/18, 5:23:03 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And write for 25 minutes without editing yourself
[29/01/18, 5:23:09 PM] Sush: I'm scared to let this thesis thing get out of hand
[29/01/18, 5:23:12 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Chi you're not being whiny
[29/01/18, 5:23:16 PM] Sush: I'm doing data work
[29/01/18, 5:23:26 PM] Sush: That itself gives me palpitations
[29/01/18, 5:23:34 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Data work means?
[29/01/18, 5:23:45 PM] Sush: Making tables
[29/01/18, 5:23:55 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Oho. You hate tables no?
[29/01/18, 5:24:15 PM] Sush: No I don't actually hate any of it right now
[29/01/18, 5:24:23 PM] Sush: I just feel terrified working on it
[29/01/18, 5:24:34 PM] Sush: Because it's towards thesis
[29/01/18, 5:26:19 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Just forget that it's about thesis if you can

[03/02/18, 4:54:33 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Touchwood
[03/02/18, 4:54:47 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Btw, I texted that guy who randomly kissed the side of my ear
[03/02/18, 4:54:53 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And said that it was not okay
[03/02/18, 4:54:56 PM] Pranathi Chicago: He apologized
[03/02/18, 5:00:00 PM] Sush: Oh good! Do you feel better about it ?
[03/02/18, 5:00:29 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I was actually worried that I made too much of a scene about it
[03/02/18, 5:00:37 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I told Josh first and he was pretty appalled and said he'd talk to him
[03/02/18, 5:00:56 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Then I said I should talk to him myself. I think this situation reminded me too much of that whole thing with Mukesh
[03/02/18, 5:01:25 PM] Pranathi Chicago: So after I told him I felt super guilty about projecting or something. But then this guy replied saying, "I get that way when I'm drunk, and that wasn't the appropriate setting for that behavior."

[11/02/18, 4:16:46 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Fuuuck that sounds so horrible

[11/02/18, 4:19:53 PM] Sush: i don't think she has the will to right now
[11/02/18, 4:20:00 PM] Sush: it'd take more to make her leave i think
[11/02/18, 4:20:02 PM] Sush: she _can_
[11/02/18, 4:20:05 PM] Sush: but she won't
[11/02/18, 4:20:31 PM] Sush: her parents have already said we will support you - this situation is ridiculous - say the word, we'll get you out
[11/02/18, 4:20:53 PM] Sush: but honestly i'd fear that they'd try and take full custody of amairah
[11/02/18, 4:20:56 PM] Sush: that MIL is nuts
[11/02/18, 4:21:28 PM] Pranathi Chicago: That's what happened to my mom's cousin

[11/02/18, 4:23:10 PM] Sush: and an abusive crazy takes it away from you
[11/02/18, 4:23:23 PM] Sush: and she probably even stayed longer than she wanted to for the kid
[11/02/18, 4:23:24 PM] Sush: UGH

[11/02/18, 4:29:51 PM] Sush: i should start doing again
[11/02/18, 4:30:02 PM] Sush: i'd keep chopped onion, bell peppers, tomato in the fridge
[11/02/18, 4:30:16 PM] Sush: and then i'd put that masala padad in the microwave
[11/02/18, 4:30:26 PM] Sush: throw the veggies on top and sprinkle chat masala
[11/02/18, 4:30:33 PM] Pranathi Chicago: OOOH

[19/02/18, 3:46:10 PM] Sush: is it kosher to just email a prof and ask if you can TA for them
[19/02/18, 3:46:16 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Nope. I think it depends on what prof is taking the course
[19/02/18, 3:46:20 PM] Sush: there's a class at harris i think i'd be a good fit for
[19/02/18, 3:46:22 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah, what do you have to lose?

[19/02/18, 4:09:33 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Haha Afrofuturism is actually really cool. It's the idea that African Americans have been so enslaved and maligned against in this world, that perhaps there exists a future which is far more utopian
[19/02/18, 4:09:56 PM] Pranathi Chicago: So this whole movement started off as a way of imagining these futures through art, literature, film etc.
[19/02/18, 4:10:07 PM] Pranathi Chicago: HI ERIN!!

[27/03/18, 2:30:20 PM] Pranathi Chicago: SO UNACCEPTABLE
[27/03/18, 2:31:03 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I would say to them that it sounds like they're being aggressive and it feels particularly violent considering you've agreed to their terms and conditions
[27/03/18, 2:31:23 PM] Sush: Right?!
[27/03/18, 2:31:31 PM] Sush: Is this not bullying right out?
[27/03/18, 2:31:33 PM] Pranathi Chicago: That it doesn't make sense to be so violent when someone's being accommodating, and they have to think long and hard about their gone

[04/04/18, 11:55:33 AM] Sush: 100%
[04/04/18, 11:55:40 AM] Sush: i could literally see the bitch singing it
[04/04/18, 11:55:49 AM] Sush: paavam maybe she's not a bitch idk
[04/04/18, 11:55:56 AM] Sush: _he_ is she isn't haha
[04/04/18, 11:56:06 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I'm always amused by the weird points at which guilt hits you
[04/04/18, 11:56:15 AM] Sush: üòÇ
[04/04/18, 11:56:17 AM] Pranathi Chicago: For bitching about her :P Or other people you feel loyalty towards
[04/04/18, 11:56:32 AM] Sush: i hate when i bitch about her :P
[04/04/18, 11:56:37 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Why?
[04/04/18, 11:56:45 AM] Sush: it feels fundamentally unfeminist or something
[04/04/18, 11:56:49 AM] Sush: _he_ decided to date her
[04/04/18, 11:56:54 AM] Sush: _he_ decided to treat me poorly
[04/04/18, 11:57:09 AM] Sush: she was pursuing something that made her happy and was available to her
[04/04/18, 11:57:31 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah that's true
[04/04/18, 11:57:46 AM] Pranathi Chicago: But also women can be awful to each other and internalized misogyny is definitely a thing.
[04/04/18, 11:57:59 AM] Pranathi Chicago: There's no point trying to ignore that because women do act spitefully toward each other sometimes
[04/04/18, 11:58:03 AM] Sush: he was a person in an 'open relationship' that she met and pursued - fully kosher
[04/04/18, 11:58:19 AM] Sush: v true!
[04/04/18, 11:58:26 AM] Sush: valentina owes me literally nothing tho
[04/04/18, 11:58:36 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah that's true.
[04/04/18, 11:58:39 AM] Sush: not like shabba / sneha dating sid
[04/04/18, 11:59:06 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah that's totally fair. He's the one to be mad at
[04/04/18, 11:59:10 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Especially because of the open relationship tag
[04/04/18, 11:59:15 AM] Sush: yep!
[04/04/18, 11:59:27 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Like I feel slightly more entitled to feeling angry about this Lauren woman because she knew we were in an exclusive relationship
[04/04/18, 11:59:39 AM] Sush: fair!
[04/04/18, 11:59:50 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And yes, she didn't know me, but I think values are about behaving with integrity even when it's not about what you owe or don't owe someone
[04/04/18, 12:00:24 PM] Sush: it takes two though
[04/04/18, 12:00:35 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah for sure. Nick is like 99% to blame
[04/04/18, 12:00:40 PM] Sush: yeah agree
[04/04/18, 12:00:49 PM] Pranathi Chicago: But there is this 1% complicity that irks me still
[04/04/18, 12:00:56 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Samvita is probably a better example of that though
[04/04/18, 12:01:08 PM] Sush: ys samvita was more steal-y
[04/04/18, 12:01:17 PM] Pranathi Chicago: She happily took advantage of me for that election and would spend hours with me daily listening to me cry about that fellow
[04/04/18, 12:01:28 PM] Sush: that's horrible
[04/04/18, 12:02:09 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah disgusting woman
[04/04/18, 12:02:15 PM] Sush: totally!
[04/04/18, 12:02:15 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I feel sorry for her though
[04/04/18, 12:02:18 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I saw her at the wedding
[04/04/18, 12:02:21 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Sabnam's wedding
[04/04/18, 12:02:25 PM] Sush: she's soulless robot i feel
[04/04/18, 12:02:29 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And I felt nothing but some weird sense of pity
[04/04/18, 12:02:39 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Like poor you for still having to deal with that squib
[04/04/18, 12:02:45 PM] Sush: she is also squib i think
[04/04/18, 12:02:51 PM] Sush: they deserve each othre
[04/04/18, 12:03:10 PM] Sush: i'm glad you escaped - i wish the process of your liberation was less painful, but PHEW
[04/04/18, 12:03:14 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah happy squibness
[04/04/18, 12:03:24 PM] Pranathi Chicago: PHEW only. I feel so relieved to be here on this side
[04/04/18, 12:03:30 PM] Sush: correct ‚ù§
[04/04/18, 12:03:31 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Happily single doing our own things
[04/04/18, 12:03:39 PM] Pranathi Chicago: We aren't doing too badly I feel ‚ù§
[04/04/18, 12:04:06 PM] Sush: we are #lit
[04/04/18, 12:04:29 PM] Sush: friends friends friendly friends we have all the friends üëª
[04/04/18, 12:04:45 PM] Sush: I WISH I LIVED IN A MUSICAL TV SHOW
[04/04/18, 12:04:54 PM] Sush: i'm listening to glee songs now
[04/04/18, 12:05:40 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Hahahaha. We do have all the friedns
[04/04/18, 12:05:42 PM] Pranathi Chicago: *friends
[04/04/18, 12:05:49 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I didn't know you were a glee fan!
[04/04/18, 12:05:55 PM] Sush: i LOVE glee üòÇüòÇ
[04/04/18, 12:06:01 PM] Sush: esp early seasons
[04/04/18, 12:06:05 PM] Sush: did you ever get into it?
[04/04/18, 12:06:14 PM] Pranathi Chicago: It all makes sense to me! Of course you would be into Glee!
[04/04/18, 12:06:20 PM] Sush: hahahaha
[04/04/18, 12:06:23 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I watched one season when it was on TV! But didn't really get into it
[04/04/18, 12:06:30 PM] Sush: i'm exactly the type of lame for Glee :P
[04/04/18, 12:06:42 PM] Sush: ohh
[04/04/18, 12:06:42 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Hahaha you're not lame
[04/04/18, 12:06:47 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Own your Gleek Pride
[04/04/18, 12:06:48 PM] Sush: glee is funfunfun
[04/04/18, 12:07:00 PM] Pranathi Chicago: It is fun! Until people started dying lol
[04/04/18, 12:07:02 PM] Sush: i LOVE when two characters sing the same song
[04/04/18, 12:07:16 PM] Sush: and they bring their personalities and current life crises to bear
[04/04/18, 12:07:46 PM] Sush: so exciting and drama
[04/04/18, 12:08:22 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Hahaha you love drama
[04/04/18, 12:08:26 PM] Pranathi Chicago: You queeeeen
[04/04/18, 12:08:33 PM] Pranathi Chicago: ‚ù§
[04/04/18, 12:08:37 PM] Sush: hahaha
[04/04/18, 12:08:41 PM] Sush: i love it
[04/04/18, 12:09:05 PM] Sush: if i could sing i'd do musical theatre
[04/04/18, 12:09:06 PM] Sush: 100%
[04/04/18, 12:09:41 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I could see you for SURE in a musical!
[04/04/18, 12:09:50 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I wish I was more into it
[04/04/18, 12:14:54 PM] Sush: i think i'm very into escapist drama
[04/04/18, 12:15:35 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Haha escapist in what way?
[04/04/18, 12:16:06 PM] Sush: i feel like music offers a certain distance from the reality of the often pretty dreary circumstances that actors are singing about
[04/04/18, 12:16:26 PM] Sush: it gives me leeway to construct a little fairytale out of my own blah life :P
[04/04/18, 12:16:54 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah that makes sense. What's your favorite musical?
[04/04/18, 12:17:03 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Have you seen Rent?
[04/04/18, 12:17:08 PM] Sush: i haven't!
[04/04/18, 12:17:13 PM] Sush: i've seen v few!
[04/04/18, 12:17:18 PM] Pranathi Chicago: It's pretty good!
[04/04/18, 12:17:18 PM] Sush: that's why i like bollywood i think haha
[04/04/18, 12:17:25 PM] Sush: i love music in stories basically
[04/04/18, 12:19:06 PM] Pranathi Chicago: That's totally fair. :D I don't know why but I prefer music being separate
[04/04/18, 12:19:21 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I like musicals but I don't listen to that music for music fixes
[04/04/18, 12:19:24 PM] Pranathi Chicago: If that makes sense
[04/04/18, 12:20:54 PM] Sush: fair!
[04/04/18, 12:21:07 PM] Sush: i actually find it hard to connect with music that didn't come to me via a story!
[04/04/18, 12:21:25 PM] Pranathi Chicago: So interestingggg I wonder what the psychology of music is
[04/04/18, 12:21:47 PM] Sush: ya and also people 'discover' music in such different ways, no?
[04/04/18, 12:22:26 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah for sure. I actually read an interesting chapter on that in a book I was reading for my project
[04/04/18, 12:22:31 PM] Pranathi Chicago: How people consume music and find new music
[04/04/18, 12:22:55 PM] Pranathi Chicago: It says that despite the changes in technology, there's a path dependency about how most people listen to music
[04/04/18, 12:23:11 PM] Pranathi Chicago: People aren't likely to change their tastes easily despite the proliferation of technology
[04/04/18, 12:24:12 PM] Sush: that's so interesting!
[04/04/18, 12:24:36 PM] Sush: the machine learning behind spotify's 'discover weekly' thing is also _fascinating_
[04/04/18, 12:25:00 PM] Sush: and part of their assumption is that people want 'new' music that's only slightly different from what they listen to
[04/04/18, 12:25:16 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah so interesting!! I hate that it's all automated tbh
[04/04/18, 12:25:43 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I looked for jobs at Spotify and was crushed to know there's no job for someone wanting to make hand-curated playlists
[04/04/18, 12:25:54 PM] Sush: hahaha!
[04/04/18, 12:26:17 PM] Sush: i kind of _love_ that behaviour can be aggregated to find macro patterns that can do these things
[04/04/18, 12:26:43 PM] Sush: you really searched for making hand-curated playlists at spotify? i LOVE that
[04/04/18, 12:26:55 PM] Sush: it sounds like an amazing job
[04/04/18, 12:27:09 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I know. :( I was seriously so sad when I found out there isn't such a thing
[04/04/18, 12:27:13 PM] Sush: hahahaa
[04/04/18, 12:27:16 PM] Sush: i'm amused also
[04/04/18, 12:28:30 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I like that these patterns exist but I feel like it takes the whimsy out of it. I would like to have really random music thrown at me that's good just musically. I would love for my tastes to be eclectic, unpredictable, but also grounded in what's musically solid
[04/04/18, 12:29:10 PM] Sush: i hear you!
[04/04/18, 12:29:24 PM] Sush: i get distracted by how _fascinating_ these algorithms are
[04/04/18, 12:30:09 PM] Sush: it is kind of a pity that the era of random discovery on the internet is pretty much over
[04/04/18, 12:30:16 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah true :(
[04/04/18, 12:30:18 PM] Sush: every single thing we see is being tailored by something
[04/04/18, 12:30:28 PM] Pranathi Chicago: That's so tragiccccc
[04/04/18, 12:30:36 PM] Sush: i barely even read books that are not on my goodreads
[04/04/18, 12:31:31 PM] Sush: ok so i'm working on a side project
[04/04/18, 12:31:35 PM] Sush: just v early stages
[04/04/18, 12:31:41 PM] Sush: on a LIPSTICK RECOMMENDATION ENGINE
[04/04/18, 12:31:51 PM] Sush: üíÑüíÑüíÑüíÑüíÑüíÑ
[04/04/18, 12:32:03 PM] Pranathi Chicago: WHAAAT
[04/04/18, 12:32:06 PM] Sush: and by 'working on it' i mean i'm reading up on recommendation algos
[04/04/18, 12:33:18 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Dude that sounds amaaaaazing
[04/04/18, 12:33:28 PM] Pranathi Chicago: So it'll tell you what kind of lipstick to buy/
[04/04/18, 12:33:29 PM] Pranathi Chicago: ?
[04/04/18, 12:33:30 PM] Sush: i have no idea where to begin lolol
[04/04/18, 12:33:34 PM] Sush: ya basically!
[04/04/18, 12:33:41 PM] Sush: based on preferences and skin tone
[04/04/18, 12:33:52 PM] Sush: i don't even know if it's possible
[04/04/18, 12:33:56 PM] Sush: and i don't know how to do it
[04/04/18, 12:34:04 PM] Sush: but maybe i can learn? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄ
[04/04/18, 12:34:22 PM] Sush: duuude
[04/04/18, 12:34:26 PM] Sush: i sang this in a group at school

[15/04/18, 11:01:52 PM] Sush: dude i had asked mikhail's friend francisco if he knew someone with adderall
[15/04/18, 11:02:14 PM] Sush: and he had said he'd ask around
[15/04/18, 11:02:20 PM] Sush: he just sent me this - "Mikhail has an adderall contact who he buys from. I was hanging out with him last night and he said that he would be happy to put you in touch with his adderall guy."
[15/04/18, 11:02:22 PM] Sush: I HATE THIS
[15/04/18, 11:02:32 PM] Pranathi Chicago: ...
[15/04/18, 11:02:45 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I don't know what to say. That's a really underhand thing for that asshole to have done
[15/04/18, 11:02:47 PM] Sush: i'm just not going to reply
[15/04/18, 11:02:49 PM] Pranathi Chicago: That's so sneaky
[15/04/18, 11:02:58 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Why would he tell Mikhail. :/
[15/04/18, 11:03:20 PM] Sush: i mean i guess maybe he doesn't know the extent of the animosity between us?
[15/04/18, 11:03:26 PM] Sush: i'm just annoyed at mikhail also
[15/04/18, 11:03:37 PM] Sush: why couldn't he just give francisco the number or whatever
[15/04/18, 11:03:47 PM] Sush: now i have to reach out to mikhail for it
[15/04/18, 11:03:50 PM] Sush: which i won't do
[15/04/18, 11:04:14 PM] Sush: and also ya obvi i'm asking him and not mikhail because i don't want to talk to mikhail!
[15/04/18, 11:05:29 PM] Sush: one part of me is like what if i'm still in ‚ù§ with Mikhail
[15/04/18, 11:05:36 PM] Sush: and another is like CHEW TOY ALERT
[15/04/18, 11:08:15 PM] Sush: SO AWKWARD
[15/04/18, 11:08:21 PM] Sush: do you think they like, laughed at me? :/
[15/04/18, 11:09:41 PM] Pranathi Chicago: You might be still in ‚ù§ with Mikhail, but that doesn't mean you should be with him
[15/04/18, 11:09:47 PM] Pranathi Chicago: He treated you cavalierly
[15/04/18, 11:10:20 PM] Pranathi Chicago: To string you along until he made up his mind? Not okay. And you deserve far better than someone who can't be sure. But it makes sense why you'd be chewtoying now
[15/04/18, 11:10:25 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And also why you'd be embarrassed
[15/04/18, 11:10:32 PM] Sush: i'm so irritated
[15/04/18, 11:10:52 PM] Pranathi Chicago: It's humiliating to know someone you love(d) would hear about something you need
[15/04/18, 11:11:04 PM] Sush: also i would never even have heard of this stupid adderall but for him
[15/04/18, 11:11:28 PM] Pranathi Chicago: :(

[15/04/18, 11:15:29 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Ayyo, sorry. :(
[15/04/18, 11:15:54 PM] Sush: it just helps distract me from the random ptsd of thesis writing
[15/04/18, 11:16:06 PM] Sush: it's so weird - i had fun writing my content analysis paper!
[15/04/18, 11:16:21 PM] Sush: so it isn't _writing a paper_ that's traumatizing

[17/04/18, 10:59:51 PM] Sush: the one you went out with?
[17/04/18, 11:00:05 PM] Pranathi Chicago: So I texted him and said if he's not interested, that's totally fine with me, but I'm addressing it because I didn't want things to get awkard
[17/04/18, 11:00:23 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And he said, "Could've been more direct, I'm sorry!"
[17/04/18, 11:00:30 PM] Pranathi Chicago: That made me feel worse though :/
[17/04/18, 11:00:50 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Ewwww I feel unloveable and I know it's in my head and I didn't even really care

[17/04/18, 11:02:40 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Like constant rejection doesn't do wonders for anyone's ego
[17/04/18, 11:03:26 PM] Sush: maybe take a break?
[17/04/18, 11:03:48 PM] Sush: just the nature of online dating i think lets people treat others in a cavalier manner
[17/04/18, 11:04:07 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah. :(

[29/04/18, 1:55:56 PM] Pranathi Chicago: It's fine, I was just being touchy! I just felt like the comment at the end was taking a shot at something I'd said earlier, not sure what. I was articulating something else entirely so it seemed a little out of place, but maybe I misunderstood

[13/05/18, 9:01:22 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Omg I was looking at that Appadurai article again on cookbooks and found this:
[13/05/18, 9:02:20 PM] Pranathi Chicago: An even more famous example of the shift from an Indian- to an English-language book is
 Samaiththu Par (Meenakshi Ammal, 1968), whose title was literally translated into the English Cook and See, since many of the young Tamil women to whom the original was addressed were functional illiterates in their mother tongue and could not read Tamil.
[13/05/18, 9:02:52 PM] Sush: Omg us!
[13/05/18, 9:02:58 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah!
[13/05/18, 9:03:19 PM] Sush: What did appadurai do after the nineties?
[13/05/18, 9:03:27 PM] Sush: What snega was referring to
[13/05/18, 9:03:29 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I think he got boring
[13/05/18, 9:03:36 PM] Pranathi Chicago: He stopped writing about stuff like this
[13/05/18, 9:03:37 PM] Sush: Ohh ok
[13/05/18, 9:03:41 PM] Pranathi Chicago: That's when he got into his scapes stuff I feel
[13/05/18, 9:03:45 PM] Sush: I thought he became Sanghi or something
[13/05/18, 9:04:03 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Lol no. Not to my knowledge, but ofc Sneha has way more awareness of the private lives of academics
[13/05/18, 9:04:10 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I somehow never find myself looking it up
[13/05/18, 10:09:41 PM] Sush: :D
[13/05/18, 10:09:53 PM] Sush: i'm very curious about that stuff too :P
[13/05/18, 10:10:09 PM] Sush: it 100% blew my mind that gayathri spivak and derrida had a torrid affair
[13/05/18, 10:12:50 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Haha yeah
[13/05/18, 10:12:57 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I also want to have a torrid affair with someone famous
[13/05/18, 10:13:01 PM] Sush: my mother stressed me out!
[13/05/18, 10:13:03 PM] Sush: lolol same
[13/05/18, 10:13:08 PM] Pranathi Chicago: What she said?
[13/05/18, 10:13:11 PM] Sush: i had a dream once that my sister married Dhoni
[13/05/18, 10:13:14 PM] Sush: it was _very_ exciting
[13/05/18, 10:13:34 PM] Sush: she stressed me out about job hunt
[13/05/18, 10:13:40 PM] Sush: i ostriched her
[13/05/18, 10:13:46 PM] Sush: and she is one tension party
[13/05/18, 10:13:52 PM] Sush: she'll never say eh chill it'll be fine
[13/05/18, 10:14:01 PM] Sush: she'll be like ayyayo!

[14/05/18, 8:54:37 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Lolol that would be funny

[14/05/18, 8:55:58 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I really would say that
[14/05/18, 8:56:25 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I think he's already admiring of your spunk
[14/05/18, 8:56:31 PM] Sush: my instinct was 'I KNOW RIGHT?!' lol
[14/05/18, 8:57:09 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Hahaha then that's what you should say
[14/05/18, 8:57:15 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I know right?
[14/05/18, 8:57:21 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I think that would be funny
[14/05/18, 8:57:25 PM] Sush: ok i will lol
[14/05/18, 8:57:29 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Go by your instinct lol
[14/05/18, 8:57:33 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Mine suck apparently
[14/05/18, 8:57:38 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I think this Dustin's over me
[14/05/18, 8:58:02 PM] Sush: it's been two days!
[14/05/18, 8:58:14 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Nooooo but it's a weird message
[14/05/18, 8:58:17 PM] Pranathi Chicago: To say "good night but we'll talk soon!"
[14/05/18, 8:58:28 PM] Pranathi Chicago: What does we'll talk soon mean? It's like please don't expect this to be a regular thing
[14/05/18, 8:58:59 PM] Sush: that is a weird thing to say
[14/05/18, 8:59:59 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah I think I should interpret it as him being over it
[14/05/18, 9:00:07 PM] Pranathi Chicago: But I don't know what went wrong...
[14/05/18, 9:00:25 PM] Sush: i don't think he'd say talk soon tho
[14/05/18, 9:00:29 PM] Sush: if he was done
[14/05/18, 9:00:32 PM] Sush: i mean he doesn't need to
[14/05/18, 9:00:46 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I guess. But it's a weirdly distancing thing to say
[14/05/18, 9:01:13 PM] Sush: we don't know how he normally talks tho
[14/05/18, 9:04:14 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I just asked him lol
[14/05/18, 9:04:25 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Nothing to lose either way
[14/05/18, 9:04:44 PM] Sush: what you asked?
[14/05/18, 9:04:54 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I said
[14/05/18, 9:05:13 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Just clarifying: when you said ‚Äúwe‚Äôll talk soon‚Äù, was that a done-and-Dustin kind of thing? No offense taken, but just so we‚Äôre clear!
[14/05/18, 9:05:36 PM] Sush: lol done and dustin
[14/05/18, 9:05:51 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I thought that was pretty funny lol
[14/05/18, 9:05:58 PM] Sush: ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄüòÇ
[14/05/18, 9:06:06 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Was that a bad move?
[14/05/18, 9:07:02 PM] Sush: i mean - nothing to lose, no?
[14/05/18, 9:07:09 PM] Sush: possible a bit premature, but it's ok
[14/05/18, 9:08:19 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I just figure if he's actually into it he'll rush to dissuade me of it
[14/05/18, 9:08:28 PM] Pranathi Chicago: But it's possible that's not an attractive thing to do either
[14/05/18, 9:08:36 PM] Pranathi Chicago: To admit vulnerability
[14/05/18, 9:08:49 PM] Sush: true - and possible unhealthy for your peace of mind to set up these tests no?
[14/05/18, 9:09:10 PM] Sush: like i don't want it to stress _you_ out
[14/05/18, 9:09:24 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I would be less stressed out if he would just say it directly tbh
[14/05/18, 9:09:33 PM] Pranathi Chicago: The weird communication games are NOT my jam
[14/05/18, 9:09:53 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And either way I don't think I want to be with someone who can't just speak their mind
[14/05/18, 9:10:02 PM] Sush: fair!
[14/05/18, 9:10:07 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Done with these emotionally stunted men
[14/05/18, 9:10:19 PM] Sush: i saw some mother's day tweet
[14/05/18, 9:10:32 PM] Sush: asking to be wished for all the emotionally stunted men she's had to mother
[14/05/18, 9:11:07 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Oh yeah I saw that too hahaha
[14/05/18, 9:13:47 PM] Sush: omg this boy's name is ORIEL
[14/05/18, 9:13:52 PM] Sush: disqualify??
[14/05/18, 9:14:04 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I'll hit you
[14/05/18, 9:14:09 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Stop being judgey about names
[14/05/18, 9:14:15 PM] Pranathi Chicago: He is so cute
[14/05/18, 9:14:25 PM] Sush: he is that
[14/05/18, 9:14:33 PM] Sush: lol he said 'ballsy move but it paid off '

[14/05/18, 9:39:55 PM] Pranathi Chicago: No he hasn't
[14/05/18, 9:40:27 PM] Sush: if he won't reply you'll know to pack now itself and save yourself a lot of heartache
[14/05/18, 9:40:56 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah but it's also like... Why am I picking these types?
[14/05/18, 9:41:27 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And how do I ever get over insecurities with men if they keep doing dumb shit like this

[04/06/18, 5:58:10 PM] Pranathi Chicago: i want you to be proud of meeeee

‚Äé[05/06/18, 11:28:02 AM] Pranathi Chicago: ‚Äéimage omitted
[05/06/18, 3:09:28 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Should I be offended that this Dustin only ever wants to hang out for like a couple of hours after 10 p.m.?
[05/06/18, 3:09:41 PM] Pranathi Chicago: He asked me what I want to do and he said a movie downtown, but doesn't know when he'll get off work
[05/06/18, 3:10:06 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I know service jobs are difficult, but I find it hard to believe he has no time for other plans otherwise...
[05/06/18, 11:35:47 PM] Sush: babe I feel like I overstepped. I was wondering out loud and I should have been more mindful about what I was saying
[05/06/18, 11:37:01 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah, that was a bit of a whammy, and I think I'm already feeling kind of touchy so it just hit me in the wrong place. I didn't mean to cut the call, but I just needed to bawl a little and I didn't really want to be on the phone for that.
[05/06/18, 11:37:49 PM] Sush: that is entirely fair - and if it matters at all, I don‚Äôt think you do it with men - I was very mindless in thinking out loud
[05/06/18, 11:38:27 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I don't know, maybe I do. It makes sense, but I just feel a little overwhelmed!
[05/06/18, 11:39:56 PM] Sush: I guess I was also thinking in terms of the anxiety of things going wrong - I can fully relate to this when I see other people do it - esp after Chetana I‚Äôve found myself thinking ‚Äòthis is the end‚Äô v often - this is probably reasonable given how the last year or so has been for us
[05/06/18, 11:40:32 PM] Sush: like I was thinking maybe that‚Äôs how your mom feels
[05/06/18, 11:41:20 PM] Sush: again it‚Äôs obviously speculation because I don‚Äôt know your mom - i was wondering because I have this anxiety and it sometimes manifests in are we ok are we ok
[05/06/18, 11:42:13 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah, I know that's how my mom feels. I just get frustrated because she's my mom and I want her to mother me, not the other way around.
[05/06/18, 11:42:41 PM] Sush: Totally fair. You should get to sit back and be taken care of sometimes
[05/06/18, 11:42:53 PM] Pranathi Chicago: It feels awful when it falls on me to assure her of that, and it falls on me more often than not.
[05/06/18, 11:43:50 PM] Sush: Understandable! Esp when it feels accusatory
[05/06/18, 11:44:21 PM] Sush: Can I call? Do you feel like talking?
[05/06/18, 11:44:33 PM] Sush: I‚Äôm so sorry I upset you
[05/06/18, 11:45:25 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah. Anyway, I didn't really intend to discuss my mom for so long. It really isn't a big deal and I won't even think about it in the morning. But I think I'm just feeling really weirdly sensitive and emotional right now
[05/06/18, 11:45:32 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Don't apologize! But would it be okay if we spoke tomorrow?
[05/06/18, 11:45:38 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I just feel easily cry-ey lol
[05/06/18, 11:46:45 PM] Sush: You talk about your mom as much as you want! It‚Äôs a hugely important relationship and somehow talking about boys is more normalised!
[05/06/18, 11:47:17 PM] Sush: Yes ‚ù§Ô∏è but also it‚Äôs 100% ok to be cry-ey to me if you feel like!
[05/06/18, 11:49:48 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I know! I just don't want to think about it now because it feels heavy and I'm overwhelmed by all the things I feel sad about. So I very very much love you and want to talk tomorrow, but I think I will just watch The Office and laugh at their dumb jokes for a bit. Would that be okay?
[05/06/18, 11:51:04 PM] Sush: Absolutely‚ù§Ô∏è love you so much! and I‚Äôm sorry I was I was unthinking and daddi!
[05/06/18, 11:51:25 PM] Pranathi Chicago: You stop apologizing! ‚ù§ Good night, love you toooooo!
[06/06/18, 11:54:19 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Sorry I haven't called back yet. Thought I'd have time between my meeting and office hours
[06/06/18, 11:54:33 AM] Pranathi Chicago: But it's been nonstop. I finish at 2! I'll call then?
[06/06/18, 2:25:49 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Hi! Just got done

[07/06/18, 12:18:41 PM] Sush: Correct
[07/06/18, 12:18:54 PM] Sush: And water just feels entirely unappealing when you‚Äôre sick
[07/06/18, 12:19:10 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah already nose is blocked etc. so it feels not so freeing haha
[07/06/18, 12:19:19 PM] Sush: Correct
[07/06/18, 12:19:26 PM] Sush: It just feels cold and oppressive

[01/07/18, 2:04:40 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Oh yeah? When?
[01/07/18, 2:04:47 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Swetha has gone back to Delhi
[01/07/18, 2:04:57 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I would like to hang with Oviya if she's here
[01/07/18, 2:04:59 PM] Sush: She‚Äôs going to be there for like a year
[01/07/18, 2:05:08 PM] Sush: I think she‚Äôs still in Madurai let me check
[01/07/18, 2:05:13 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I'm getting stressed that I haven't started interviews
[01/07/18, 2:05:24 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Can't rush also, but I'm just sitting around at home
[01/07/18, 2:05:40 PM] Sush: When you‚Äôll start?
[01/07/18, 2:05:41 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Anyway I am having stomach upset
[01/07/18, 2:05:45 PM] Sush: Ayyo!
[01/07/18, 2:05:48 PM] Sush: Paapa!
[01/07/18, 2:05:52 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Ugh one whole hungama happened with that Tenma fellow
[01/07/18, 2:06:10 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I forgot his name and I was swiping on Tinder Chennai just to see. Literally he was the first person
[01/07/18, 2:06:14 PM] Sush: WhaatüòÇüòÇ
[01/07/18, 2:06:17 PM] Sush: Omg hahaha
[01/07/18, 2:06:20 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Then I opened his bio after I swiped
[01/07/18, 2:06:26 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Then I was like fuckkkkkk
[01/07/18, 2:06:29 PM] Sush: Ouccch
[01/07/18, 2:06:31 PM] Pranathi Chicago: But ofc he caught on
[01/07/18, 2:06:34 PM] Sush: Lolol
[01/07/18, 2:06:49 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And then I was like haha, let's just forget about it, accident!
[01/07/18, 2:07:03 PM] Sush: ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòÇ
[01/07/18, 2:07:08 PM] Pranathi Chicago: He said no no, can separate. I was worried about being more forceful because then I was worried he'd not give me interview
[01/07/18, 2:07:17 PM] Pranathi Chicago: We chatted for a while and then I went off outside
[01/07/18, 2:07:21 PM] Pranathi Chicago: So forgot to reply
[01/07/18, 2:07:35 PM] Pranathi Chicago: That night I came home and texted and he was like suuuuuper salty
[01/07/18, 2:07:41 PM] Sush: Oh no!
[01/07/18, 2:07:48 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I said sorry to get back to business but when interview?
[01/07/18, 2:07:55 PM] Pranathi Chicago: He said he's really busy and has to check his schedule
[01/07/18, 2:08:01 PM] Sush: His dick must have shriveled up
[01/07/18, 2:08:07 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Which is all BS because I think it's an ego thing
[01/07/18, 2:08:10 PM] Sush: Pardon my subtlety
[01/07/18, 2:08:16 PM] Sush: Ya seriously!
[01/07/18, 2:08:17 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Lolol love your imagery
[01/07/18, 2:08:25 PM] Pranathi Chicago: But now I'm waiting for him to get back to me
[01/07/18, 2:08:31 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Which is soooo annoying
[01/07/18, 2:08:39 PM] Sush: ugh ya :(
[01/07/18, 2:08:48 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Anyway, I've decided to sit on his head and ping him every few days
[01/07/18, 2:08:55 PM] Sush: Pack off tinder in Chennai :/
[01/07/18, 2:09:00 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Have to be pushy with these things
[01/07/18, 2:09:04 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah I deleted it
[01/07/18, 2:09:10 PM] Sush: I don‚Äôt trust men to put that aside
[01/07/18, 2:09:13 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I saw too many people I knew
[01/07/18, 2:09:20 PM] Sush: Ugh lol
[01/07/18, 2:09:45 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah. So now I'm just going to wait till he gives me a date
[01/07/18, 2:09:53 PM] Pranathi Chicago: He did give me other suggestions also
[01/07/18, 2:10:00 PM] Pranathi Chicago: So I don't think he's too mad
[01/07/18, 2:10:04 PM] Sush: Oh phew
[01/07/18, 2:10:11 PM] Pranathi Chicago: But he's definitely not as ready to meet me immediately as he was
[01/07/18, 2:10:18 PM] Pranathi Chicago: He said something so weird though
[01/07/18, 2:10:20 PM] Sush: Take his tiny ego a couple of days to get over it I imagine
[01/07/18, 2:10:22 PM] Sush: What?
[01/07/18, 2:10:26 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I think he was trying to figure out my caste
[01/07/18, 2:10:52 PM] Pranathi Chicago: He was like, "Should i take you to Vyasarpadi beef biryani or Bay 146?"
[01/07/18, 2:11:07 PM] Sush: Abbah
[01/07/18, 2:11:10 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Which also might be a class thing but beef...
[01/07/18, 2:11:21 PM] Sush: That‚Äôs so loaded
[01/07/18, 2:11:38 PM] Sush: And designed to make you feel bad about bay 146
[01/07/18, 2:11:44 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I know right. Anyway, he'll probably eventually acquiesce
[01/07/18, 2:11:50 PM] Pranathi Chicago: It's just frustrating that I was so stupid
[01/07/18, 2:11:55 PM] Sush: You should look like bay 146 and want to go to biryani
[01/07/18, 2:11:55 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Like I could've checked the name
[01/07/18, 2:12:11 PM] Sush: Tinder is so fast fast it could happen
[01/07/18, 2:12:20 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Exactly. I wish I could include in my memos lol
[01/07/18, 2:12:33 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Such an interesting question to ask someone to figure out caste and class status
[01/07/18, 2:12:39 PM] Sush: Seriously!
[01/07/18, 2:12:50 PM] Sush: and the moment you say you don‚Äôt eat meat you‚Äôre the dick there
[01/07/18, 2:12:56 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I'm meeting Milind some time this week hopefully. Looks like he's on holiday
[01/07/18, 2:13:02 PM] Sush: Ohh nice!
[01/07/18, 2:13:07 PM] Sush: He should have good leads
[01/07/18, 2:13:10 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I'm also meeting SP who's ugh but he is a Carnatic singer
[01/07/18, 2:13:12 PM] Sush: And maybe even insights
[01/07/18, 2:13:14 PM] Sush: Lolol
[01/07/18, 2:13:17 PM] Sush: Ya he‚Äôs useful
[01/07/18, 2:13:18 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And he might have something interesting to say
[01/07/18, 2:13:30 PM] Sush: Even if inadvertently üòÖ
[01/07/18, 2:13:34 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah this whole not eating meat thing lol
[01/07/18, 2:13:50 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah he's probably going to be interesting to talk about the caste in Carnatic question with
[01/07/18, 2:13:57 PM] Sush: Ya!!
[01/07/18, 2:14:03 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I'm also going to some kutcheri this week
[01/07/18, 2:14:09 PM] Sush: So nice‚ù§Ô∏è
[01/07/18, 2:14:10 PM] Pranathi Chicago: So that should be nice
[01/07/18, 2:14:17 PM] Sush: I‚Äôm excited for you to uncover all this
[01/07/18, 2:14:34 PM] Sush: (and I want to vicariously uncover also)
[01/07/18, 2:14:54 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah it's not like I'm not doing anything, but it's just busy emailing work at this point which is frustrating. I've also emailed some Dalit activists but I'm worried they will get annoyed at both my English and my Tamil
[01/07/18, 2:14:57 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Hahaha me too!
[01/07/18, 2:15:05 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I will tell you all, not to worry
[01/07/18, 2:15:11 PM] Pranathi Chicago: What are you going to do today?
[01/07/18, 2:15:18 PM] Sush: Oh ya! Such a tricky line to balance
[01/07/18, 2:15:24 PM] Sush: I‚Äôm on 6 back from downtown now
[01/07/18, 2:15:36 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Oh you dropped her off?
[01/07/18, 2:15:50 PM] Sush: She took Uber straight from downtown
[01/07/18, 2:16:07 PM] Sush: We took her bag and left in the morning
[01/07/18, 2:16:14 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Oh nice nice. Where does she live again?
[01/07/18, 2:16:20 PM] Sush: I told her about Chetana and mikhail and cried lol
[01/07/18, 2:16:27 PM] Sush: She‚Äôs in Harvard now doing the MPA
[01/07/18, 2:16:48 PM] Sush: but she‚Äôs interning in DC at the world bank over he summer
[01/07/18, 2:16:54 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Aww paavam! ‚ô•Ô∏è was she comforting and kind?

[01/07/18, 2:17:53 PM] Pranathi Chicago: That's definitely very special!
[01/07/18, 2:18:06 PM] Sush: Ya it didn‚Äôt feel like we hadn‚Äôt seen each other in two years!!
[01/07/18, 2:18:16 PM] Sush: We could literally not stop talking lol
[01/07/18, 2:18:34 PM] Pranathi Chicago: So so so lovely! I'm so happy for you! üíï
[01/07/18, 2:18:43 PM] Pranathi Chicago: My mom is so funny
[01/07/18, 2:18:56 PM] Pranathi Chicago: She wanted to send my details to that guy's family
[01/07/18, 2:19:17 PM] Pranathi Chicago: He seems okay only. He also interned in Waterloo! But maybe he's boring to talk to, who knows
[01/07/18, 2:19:33 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Anyway, my mom wrote a little write up about me to send and it was so cute haha
[01/07/18, 2:19:40 PM] Pranathi Chicago: She included that I like jazz and all
[01/07/18, 2:19:58 PM] Sush: Omg! So cute and thoughtful!
[01/07/18, 2:20:02 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I was so touched she thought about those things and she's genuinely being so chill about it
[01/07/18, 2:20:16 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I told her I might say no immediately at any point
[01/07/18, 2:20:23 PM] Pranathi Chicago: She was like ya ya, who cares about them
[01/07/18, 2:20:29 PM] Pranathi Chicago: This is only for you
[01/07/18, 2:20:34 PM] Sush: That‚Äôs so nice! And just the right attitude!
[01/07/18, 2:20:48 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeahhhh which is why I'm also like cool, such low stakes
[01/07/18, 2:21:02 PM] Sush: Very nice!

[01/07/18, 4:07:04 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I felt kinda meh because my school friend Tanvi was so lukewarm about meeting when I said I was back
[01/07/18, 4:07:34 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Like she says she's busy all week and can only meet Saturday for dinner perhaps. I know people have lives and all, but it's also just annoying because I don't have anyone to hang out with here
[01/07/18, 4:07:51 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Haha I sound super petulant
[01/07/18, 4:08:02 PM] Sush: Stupid Tanvi
[01/07/18, 4:08:07 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I just need to get out of the house and do something social
[01/07/18, 4:08:17 PM] Pranathi Chicago: My family is actually being really cute and sweet and fun paavam
[01/07/18, 4:08:26 PM] Sush: So nice! How‚Äôs your brother?
[01/07/18, 4:08:27 PM] Pranathi Chicago: But still, family is family. And breaks are needed
[01/07/18, 4:08:38 PM] Sush: Pucca
[01/07/18, 4:08:40 PM] Pranathi Chicago: He's fine! He keeps hanging out with his friends and going to kutcheris
[01/07/18, 4:08:54 PM] Pranathi Chicago: He asked me to tag along to kutcheri today but I had stomach upset so didn't want to risk
[01/07/18, 4:09:15 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Amma is making poori tomorrow üòç
[01/07/18, 4:09:16 PM] Sush: Paavam! Are you doing Xtra pooping
[01/07/18, 4:09:21 PM] Sush: Yaaay!
[01/07/18, 4:09:23 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I have volunteered to make paneer
[01/07/18, 4:09:28 PM] Sush: Amaze!
[01/07/18, 4:09:29 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Hahaha yes indeed I am
[01/07/18, 4:09:38 PM] Pranathi Chicago: You know that burning poo you get sometimes
[01/07/18, 4:09:44 PM] Sush: Yaaaa
[01/07/18, 4:09:46 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I think it was flight food
[01/07/18, 4:09:52 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Or maybe Amethyst
[01/07/18, 4:10:15 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I spoke to one old classmate from school called Akshay today because I randomly dreamed about him!
[01/07/18, 4:10:30 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And felt like I should reach out. It was suchhhhh a lovely nostalgic conversation
[01/07/18, 4:10:44 PM] Pranathi Chicago: He's in Chennai only and I asked if we could meet
[01/07/18, 4:10:46 PM] Sush: So nice!
[01/07/18, 4:10:54 PM] Sush: Maybe Akshay is the man of your dreams
[01/07/18, 4:10:58 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Then he said he can't tell me what exactly but he's in no condition to meet
[01/07/18, 4:11:07 PM] Pranathi Chicago: That he may not be for the next decade or so
[01/07/18, 4:11:13 PM] Sush: Whaat
[01/07/18, 4:11:23 PM] Pranathi Chicago: My heart sort of broke and I don't know what's up, but he said he doesn't feel like being social
[01/07/18, 4:11:26 PM] Sush: What does that even mean
[01/07/18, 4:11:30 PM] Sush: Paavam!
[01/07/18, 4:11:30 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I wonder if it's depression or something
[01/07/18, 4:11:37 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Ugh it made me so sad
[01/07/18, 4:11:45 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I've just been lying in bed and tossing and turning
[01/07/18, 4:11:56 PM] Pranathi Chicago: In 9th standard he cycled to my house once to surprise me
[01/07/18, 4:12:13 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I brought it up today and he said he remembers everything about it, what I was wearing and all
[01/07/18, 4:12:27 PM] Sush: omg paavam :(
[01/07/18, 4:12:32 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And then said he wishes he could go back to those times because everything was so much simpler and the smallest things made him happy
[01/07/18, 4:12:34 PM] Sush: You think he‚Äôs hurt or something?
[01/07/18, 4:12:36 PM] Sush: Oh wow
[01/07/18, 4:12:43 PM] Sush: Sounds like depression only :(
[01/07/18, 4:12:51 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah. :(
[01/07/18, 4:12:56 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Paaaaaavam
[01/07/18, 4:13:14 PM] Pranathi Chicago: God life is so hard for some people. I asked him what he was doing twice but he didn't respond
[01/07/18, 4:13:31 PM] Pranathi Chicago: This boy is adopted. MS Swaminathan's grandson
[01/07/18, 4:13:38 PM] Sush: So paavam :(
[01/07/18, 4:13:44 PM] Sush: Even Gayathri isn‚Äôt doing anything
[01/07/18, 4:13:54 PM] Sush: She hasn‚Äôt been able to because of her mental health stuff

[04/07/18, 2:17:32 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I don't know. I don't think they're proud of me

[06/07/18, 2:28:07 PM] Sush: Ya tell!
[06/07/18, 2:28:09 PM] Pranathi Chicago: He was decent only! He didn't make me feel weird. He was like going on and on about his own autobiography lol
[06/07/18, 2:28:17 PM] Sush: üòÖ
[06/07/18, 2:28:20 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Which was interesting but I was also like okay, pls stop so I can ask other kostins
[06/07/18, 2:28:25 PM] Pranathi Chicago: But he answered all of them.
[06/07/18, 2:28:38 PM] Pranathi Chicago: He said his stance is not "pro Dalit but pro equality"
[06/07/18, 2:28:44 PM] Pranathi Chicago: So he actually hates the whole Brahmin hating thing
[06/07/18, 2:28:50 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Which I found super interesting
[06/07/18, 2:28:57 PM] Sush: Interesting
[06/07/18, 2:28:57 PM] Pranathi Chicago: He said a lot of political people hate him
[06/07/18, 2:29:17 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And he was like yaya, Carnatic is very beautiful
[06/07/18, 2:29:25 PM] Pranathi Chicago: The problem is that it's been institutionalized
[06/07/18, 2:29:34 PM] Pranathi Chicago: That is its boon and its curse, he said
[06/07/18, 2:29:41 PM] Sush: Ooh
[06/07/18, 2:29:46 PM] Sush: Quite sensible sounding
[06/07/18, 2:29:53 PM] Sush: In terms of the music
[06/07/18, 2:29:56 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I think he meant to say that Carnatic has been extremely centralized
[06/07/18, 2:30:11 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And that if it could be decentralized, there's nothing wrong with the form
[06/07/18, 2:30:22 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Which is different from what other people say like it's too Sanskritized and all
[06/07/18, 2:30:29 PM] Pranathi Chicago: But this guy has crazy eclectic influences
[06/07/18, 2:30:36 PM] Pranathi Chicago: We spoke about Hindustani, jazz, hiphop
[06/07/18, 2:31:04 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And same politically also. He speaks about Ambedkar, Mandela, and Malcolm X all in the same breath.
[06/07/18, 2:31:10 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Which sounds a little garbled, but it's also to see what he's getting at
[06/07/18, 2:34:25 PM] Sush: so fascinating!
[06/07/18, 2:34:31 PM] Sush: sorry, i ran into someone
[06/07/18, 2:34:40 PM] Sush: he sounds so dynamic
[06/07/18, 2:35:02 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah. I think some of his thinking is still a little unclear
[06/07/18, 2:35:06 PM] Pranathi Chicago: He was contradicting himself in places
[06/07/18, 2:35:11 PM] Pranathi Chicago: But it's fascinating nonetheless
[06/07/18, 2:35:30 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Apparently he went from being a hiphop producer in London to being homeless in Chennai
[06/07/18, 2:35:34 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Until a few years ago
[06/07/18, 2:35:46 PM] Sush: whoa üò≥
[06/07/18, 2:35:52 PM] Pranathi Chicago: The only thing I could think of then was, "Fame is a fickle friend, Harry."
[06/07/18, 2:36:58 PM] Sush: Celebrity is as celebrity does!
[06/07/18, 2:37:01 PM] Sush: üòÇ
[06/07/18, 2:37:23 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Hahaha

[06/07/18, 9:28:31 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Hahahaha oh noooo
[07/07/18, 9:30:43 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I had a dream about our planet being colonized by another one called Kalani!
[07/07/18, 9:32:33 PM] Sush: whaaaat
[07/07/18, 9:32:55 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I was in an arcade where they were educating us on the screens about the universe
[07/07/18, 9:33:02 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And how insignificant our planet is compared to theirs
[07/07/18, 9:33:41 PM] Sush: üòÖ

[08/07/18, 10:40:56 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yes yes Anthro Josh
[08/07/18, 10:41:20 AM] Pranathi Chicago: He's been AWOL because he's been moving and doing the hundred million things he's committed himself to somehow
[08/07/18, 10:42:31 AM] Sush: ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
[08/07/18, 10:42:41 AM] Sush: Paapa must be hard to work at home also for you

[08/07/18, 10:43:28 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Dumb fellow
[08/07/18, 10:43:31 AM] Sush: Are you excited for Gangtok?
[08/07/18, 10:43:31 AM] Pranathi Chicago: What's up with you?
[08/07/18, 10:43:37 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yessss I am excited!
[08/07/18, 10:44:47 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I spoke with Nitya today while she cooked and it was so hilarious lol
[08/07/18, 10:44:56 AM] Pranathi Chicago: She was getting so confused hahaha
[08/07/18, 10:45:20 AM] Sush: üòÇ how is she doing?
[08/07/18, 10:45:43 AM] Pranathi Chicago: She's fine. I think normal growing pains of being in a new country, new place
[08/07/18, 10:45:46 AM] Pranathi Chicago: She hates cooking :P
[08/07/18, 10:45:56 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Also she was cooking some chicken fish and all so I didn't even know how to help her
[08/07/18, 10:46:05 AM] Pranathi Chicago: It was turning white apparently, and she was like, "Is this normal?"
[08/07/18, 10:46:16 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I wasn't sure because none of the food we cook really turns white when it's getting cooked. :P
[08/07/18, 10:49:30 AM] Sush: Lolol!
[08/07/18, 10:49:57 AM] Sush: That boyfriend is behaving better?
[08/07/18, 10:50:15 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Ugh not really. Well, he's being nice in the short term but she says she knows she can't expect it forever
[08/07/18, 10:50:39 AM] Pranathi Chicago: He's not happy there (in America) so he's clinging on to her for the first time instead of being standoffish and toxically masculine
[08/07/18, 10:50:47 AM] Pranathi Chicago: But she thinks it won't last when he goes to B school next year
[08/07/18, 10:51:21 AM] Sush: Ugh he sounds terrible
[08/07/18, 11:36:58 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Lol he is
[08/07/18, 11:37:01 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Just finished meeting habba

[08/07/18, 11:42:16 AM] Sush: i'm starting to get bored lol
[08/07/18, 11:42:18 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I think I scared this Nitya into thinking she might have salmonella
[08/07/18, 11:42:24 AM] Sush: what is salmonella?!
[08/07/18, 11:42:25 AM] Pranathi Chicago: She said she has a bad stomach after eating her food
[08/07/18, 11:42:31 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I asked if she washed her spinach and she said no
[08/07/18, 11:42:37 AM] Sush: ohhhh
[08/07/18, 11:42:38 AM] Sush: hahaha
[08/07/18, 11:42:39 AM] Sush: yeah
[08/07/18, 11:42:41 AM] Pranathi Chicago: What is salmonella ah? That bacteria haha
[08/07/18, 11:42:46 AM] Sush: must wash that spinach
[08/07/18, 11:42:58 AM] Sush: ohh diarrhoea causing thign?
[08/07/18, 11:44:03 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yep yep
[08/07/18, 11:44:09 AM] Pranathi Chicago: It causes food poisoning
[08/07/18, 11:44:18 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I feel like as a hypochondriac, I'm a terrible friend
[08/07/18, 12:27:30 PM] Sush: üòÖ I mean it‚Äôs easy to tell if you have diarrhoea or not fortunately!
[08/07/18, 12:27:36 PM] Sush: Not much left to the imagination
[08/07/18, 12:27:40 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Haha
[08/07/18, 12:27:44 PM] Pranathi Chicago: My mom is stressing me the fuck out
[08/07/18, 12:28:05 PM] Pranathi Chicago: My dad and I had an argument yesterday. I said I kinda want to take the scooter for fieldwork because I'm spending so much on Ubers
[08/07/18, 12:28:17 PM] Pranathi Chicago: It was just some offhand thought, I was thinking out loud
[08/07/18, 12:28:38 PM] Pranathi Chicago: My dad got so angry so quickly and was making this inane arguments, raising his voice about how I don't have learner's permit and shit
[08/07/18, 12:28:51 PM] Sush: Ayyo :/
[08/07/18, 12:28:57 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And I said something about him being angry for no reason, which made him get angrier. My mom just stood there silently the whole time
[08/07/18, 12:29:11 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Now today she comes and tells me that I am hurting my dad's feelings
[08/07/18, 12:29:26 PM] Sush: Whaaat :/
[08/07/18, 12:29:31 PM] Pranathi Chicago: That I need to be more careful about my tone with him
[08/07/18, 12:29:34 PM] Sush: That seems unfair
[08/07/18, 12:30:04 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah and when I said that she started sort of sniffling and feeling all sorry for herself because apparently she's the only one watching out for the family or some crap
[08/07/18, 12:30:23 PM] Sush: Ayyo! I hateeee when they do that
[08/07/18, 12:30:31 PM] Sush: It‚Äôs infuriating and self aggrandising
[08/07/18, 12:31:36 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah. I told her that it sucks that she wants me to just fake being happy about everything he does and says
[08/07/18, 12:31:48 PM] Pranathi Chicago: She was like, "Anyway you're leaving in a few weeks, why can't you?"
[08/07/18, 12:32:09 PM] Sush: omg this is literally the problem
[08/07/18, 12:32:15 PM] Sush: Sweep everything under the carpet
[08/07/18, 12:32:21 PM] Sush: Never talk about shit
[08/07/18, 12:32:33 PM] Sush: Ripe for unhealthy relationships when you‚Äôre older
[08/07/18, 12:32:42 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And it's always like, let's spare appa's feelings. Let's all learn how to step around his feelings and his temper and his ego
[08/07/18, 12:33:23 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Like why?! I literally said that about how I don't want him getting to be an older man who is egotistical and intolerant of criticism. And she got upset saying I was painting him in such a terrible light and how could I do that
[08/07/18, 12:33:31 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I want to scream.
[08/07/18, 12:33:36 PM] Sush: Ughhhhh
[08/07/18, 12:33:41 PM] Sush: This whole false idea of respect
[08/07/18, 12:35:22 PM] Pranathi Chicago: My brother doesn't even stand up for me
[08/07/18, 12:35:25 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Not even in private
[08/07/18, 12:35:30 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I even told him that
[08/07/18, 12:35:40 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And he just got really defensive and said there's nothing for him to say
[08/07/18, 12:35:45 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Ugh
[08/07/18, 12:36:06 PM] Sush: That sucks man :/
[08/07/18, 12:36:20 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I worry that he's becoming toxically masculine too.
[08/07/18, 12:36:45 PM] Pranathi Chicago: We had some argument about gender the other day and he didn't say a word. When I asked him why he was silent, pointed out that that was complicity, he just sat there.
[08/07/18, 12:36:51 PM] Pranathi Chicago: It was so infuriating.
[08/07/18, 12:37:14 PM] Sush: That is troubling!
[08/07/18, 12:37:16 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I feel really distant from the three of them. Like I'm some cuckoo who has radical ideas and is muddying up the gene pool lol
[08/07/18, 12:37:37 PM] Pranathi Chicago: They don't like my project at all. I can tell.
[08/07/18, 12:37:55 PM] Sush: Because it raises uncomfortable questions?
[08/07/18, 12:38:00 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I said something about some maami who comes home behaving in TamBrahm ways and my mom said I was being a bigot
[08/07/18, 12:38:09 PM] Pranathi Chicago: That I was unfairly judging people and labeling them.
[08/07/18, 12:38:20 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah, pretty much. It puts them on the defensive and they'd rather not hear it.
[08/07/18, 12:38:33 PM] Sush: Yeah I can 100% imagine
[08/07/18, 12:38:41 PM] Sush: My dad would reach the same way
[08/07/18, 12:39:01 PM] Pranathi Chicago: They won't say it to me, but it's causing a rift and that really worries me.
[08/07/18, 12:39:11 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Because of course it's my job to make myself palatable to them, not the other way around.
[08/07/18, 12:39:33 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I dunno, maybe this was a bad idea to do this project to begin with. Just with everything at home.
[08/07/18, 12:40:55 PM] Sush: I mean, they‚Äôre going to have to find a way to be on board no?
[08/07/18, 12:41:51 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I guess, but they're not trying very hard.
[08/07/18, 12:42:21 PM] Pranathi Chicago: My mom today, with her whole speech. She was basically conveying the message that I should try harder to just go along with them and not make myself noticeably radical.
[08/07/18, 12:42:44 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Especially before vacation. Like, "Please don't ruin our vacation."
[08/07/18, 12:42:53 PM] Pranathi Chicago: "Appa's so excited, don't ruin it for him."
[08/07/18, 12:42:54 PM] Sush: ugh that is so unfair
[08/07/18, 12:43:00 PM] Sush: You don‚Äôt have to listen to her though
[08/07/18, 12:43:11 PM] Sush: I know it‚Äôs super hard
[08/07/18, 12:43:20 PM] Sush: But I feel like conflicts will happen anyway
[08/07/18, 12:43:28 PM] Sush: For some reason or other
[08/07/18, 12:43:39 PM] Sush: Might as well not waste time and energy minimising yourself
[08/07/18, 12:44:08 PM] Sush: Because it isn‚Äôt going to actually stave off conflict
[08/07/18, 12:45:11 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah
[08/07/18, 12:45:26 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Rebecca asked me how it was going and I mentioned the bare minimum of all this stuff
[08/07/18, 12:45:36 PM] Pranathi Chicago: She goes, "They're crazies, I'm sorry"
[08/07/18, 12:45:58 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And in spite of all this, I don't want to speak about them that way. It was so annoying she took the liberty to say that even though I know she means well.
[08/07/18, 12:46:39 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Anyway, I guess they're not really going to change themselves for me so I just have to expect conflict.
[08/07/18, 12:48:17 PM] Sush: that's annoying of her!
[08/07/18, 12:48:35 PM] Sush: idk - is it just inevitable for conflict to break out in close quarters?
[08/07/18, 12:48:43 PM] Sush: i wonder what families it doesn't happen in look like
[08/07/18, 12:48:58 PM] Sush: it's so annoying and infuriating, i'm sorry you're in the midst of it now :/
[08/07/18, 12:51:30 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I don't think so. I imagine there must be some functional families out there no?
[08/07/18, 12:51:33 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I hope, anyway
[08/07/18, 12:52:00 PM] Pranathi Chicago: It's okay. I think I just have to remember this for next time and seriously get another apartment or something.
[08/07/18, 12:52:18 PM] Sush: do you think it affects your dad less than your mom thinks?
[08/07/18, 12:52:31 PM] Sush: like it's between you and him - her intervention makes it worse?
[08/07/18, 12:53:01 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I think it isn't great between us. I'm noticing how averse to criticism my dad is, and how sensitive he is to comments.
[08/07/18, 12:53:15 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And he won't talk about it, but he'll show it by snapping at me for something completely irrelevant.
[08/07/18, 12:53:25 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Which is so toxically masculine
[08/07/18, 12:53:29 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And it infuriates me more
[08/07/18, 12:53:32 PM] Sush: ugh i know exactly what you mean
[08/07/18, 12:53:46 PM] Pranathi Chicago: But my mom is making it even worse by coming between us
[08/07/18, 12:54:00 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And then telling me to just drop the criticism of dad altogether
[08/07/18, 12:54:04 PM] Sush: yeah...
[08/07/18, 12:54:07 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Because I resent her, and I resent him more
[08/07/18, 12:54:15 PM] Sush: :/
[08/07/18, 12:54:15 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And that's a horrible feeling to have
[08/07/18, 12:54:19 PM] Sush: for sure
[08/07/18, 12:57:04 PM] Pranathi Chicago: It's okay. I think I'm just going to keep my project stuff to myself
[08/07/18, 12:58:58 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Am I blowing this out of proportion?
[08/07/18, 1:14:22 PM] Sush: no, you're not!
[08/07/18, 1:14:33 PM] Sush: i'd feel the same way
[08/07/18, 1:14:43 PM] Sush: sorry, mom called
[08/07/18, 1:23:13 PM] Pranathi Chicago: No worries!
[08/07/18, 1:23:20 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I think I should just go to sleep
[08/07/18, 1:23:23 PM] Sush: How are you feeling?
[08/07/18, 1:23:25 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I'm driving myself up the wall about this
[08/07/18, 1:23:39 PM] Pranathi Chicago: *thinking about
[08/07/18, 1:23:45 PM] Sush: Fair :(
[08/07/18, 1:23:51 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Not great. I think my mom is being manipulative
[08/07/18, 1:23:59 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And I think it's really unfair and it bugs me
[08/07/18, 1:24:18 PM] Pranathi Chicago: But I don't know what to do about it except say to myself it's not going to affect me
[08/07/18, 1:24:22 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Even though it does
[08/07/18, 1:24:33 PM] Sush: It is unfair to expect that everyone pander to the biggest male ego in the room
[08/07/18, 1:24:48 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah. I can't even talk to her about the gender aspect
[08/07/18, 1:24:53 PM] Pranathi Chicago: She'll just say I'm making it up
[08/07/18, 1:25:33 PM] Sush: True :/
[08/07/18, 1:26:19 PM] Sush: and it‚Äôll sound far out radical in a way that gets their backs job
[08/07/18, 1:26:26 PM] Sush: *backs up
[08/07/18, 1:43:08 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah
[08/07/18, 1:43:12 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Okay must sleep now
[08/07/18, 1:43:18 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I love you and thanks for listening to me vent!
[08/07/18, 1:43:20 PM] Pranathi Chicago: ‚ù§
[08/07/18, 1:43:26 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Have a lovely day
[09/07/18, 10:52:07 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Dude West Bengal really needs to get its act together lol
[09/07/18, 1:05:32 PM] Sush: lolol
[09/07/18, 1:05:36 PM] Sush: siliguri?
[09/07/18, 7:41:09 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yep!
[09/07/18, 10:42:00 PM] Sush: how are youuuu
[09/07/18, 10:42:07 PM] Sush: reached gangtok?
[10/07/18, 10:36:58 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Helloooo! Yes yes, it's so beautiful here
[10/07/18, 10:37:16 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Except I don't get reception unless I come to lobby so I cannot able to respond or see texts!
[10/07/18, 10:37:20 AM] Pranathi Chicago: How are youuuuu

[10/07/18, 10:40:09 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And apologies if I'm very slow to respond
[10/07/18, 10:40:14 AM] Sush: Just continuing to chill
[10/07/18, 10:40:17 AM] Sush: No worriesss
[10/07/18, 10:40:16 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Even wifi is cranky
[10/07/18, 10:40:23 AM] Sush: It‚Äôll be nice to cut off also no
[10/07/18, 10:40:37 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah I thought I'd just sit here in the lobby for 10 mins to check email
[10/07/18, 10:40:55 AM] Pranathi Chicago: We have book chapter work so that's the one thing I need to check phone for
[10/07/18, 10:41:03 AM] Pranathi Chicago: But once I go back to my room anyway there's no wifi
[10/07/18, 10:41:10 AM] Sush: Ohh okok

[13/07/18, 10:33:30 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I've also just had way too much time around my family
[13/07/18, 10:33:33 AM] Pranathi Chicago: In close quarters
[13/07/18, 10:33:42 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I'm getting snappy about everything

[13/07/18, 10:42:06 AM] Sush: ooh i'm just about 15% through
[13/07/18, 10:42:25 AM] Pranathi Chicago: My mom insisted on wearing her coat PLUS shawl even though it was only like 12 degrees out and I had to not facepalm
[13/07/18, 10:42:31 AM] Sush: üòÇ
[13/07/18, 10:42:43 AM] Sush: look at you and your little denim jacket ‚ù§
[13/07/18, 10:42:44 AM] Pranathi Chicago: It's a weirdly disjointed book no?
[13/07/18, 10:42:50 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Hahaha ‚ù§
[13/07/18, 10:42:53 AM] Sush: it is!
[13/07/18, 10:43:01 AM] Sush: it feels very _male_ so far
[13/07/18, 10:43:13 AM] Sush: ooh how did you like Serious Men?
[13/07/18, 10:43:19 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I only wore it because mom insisted that I not die of pneumonia
[13/07/18, 10:43:26 AM] Sush: hahaha
[13/07/18, 10:43:38 AM] Pranathi Chicago: It is very very male and I seriously abhorred the protagonist by the end
[13/07/18, 10:43:48 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Not to prejudice but I imagine you'll come to the same conclusion
[13/07/18, 10:43:59 AM] Sush: i can see it coming
[13/07/18, 10:44:04 AM] Pranathi Chicago: The only other contemporary Nigerian author I've read is Chimamanda
[13/07/18, 10:44:11 AM] Sush: same
[13/07/18, 10:44:12 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And I never like her protagonists either
[13/07/18, 10:44:16 AM] Sush: haha yeah
[13/07/18, 10:44:17 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I just can't identify with them
[13/07/18, 10:44:19 AM] Sush: esp in americannah
[13/07/18, 10:44:26 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeahhh especially that one
[13/07/18, 10:44:34 AM] Sush: i think i liked the one in purple hibiscus
[13/07/18, 10:44:42 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Then I realized Teju Cole and her are friends, he thanks her in the acks
[13/07/18, 10:45:13 AM] Sush: ohhhh
[13/07/18, 10:45:18 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah that was a lovely book. So steeped in detail
[13/07/18, 10:45:34 AM] Pranathi Chicago: This book is so pompous and I don't care for the circularity of the writing style
[13/07/18, 10:45:48 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Every time he mentioned some opera I wanted to shoot him
[13/07/18, 10:45:52 AM] Sush: I KNOW
[13/07/18, 10:45:55 AM] Sush: so much...exposition

[13/07/18, 10:46:40 AM] Sush: omg YAK ‚ù§ ‚ù§ ‚ù§
[13/07/18, 10:47:06 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Dude this place is so beautiful. I'm surprised at my family for picking such an... adventurous spot
[13/07/18, 10:47:09 AM] Sush: are they smelly?!
[13/07/18, 10:47:13 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Near Nathula we had to even hike a little
[13/07/18, 10:47:18 AM] Sush: so nice!
[13/07/18, 10:47:21 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah erumamaadu types
[13/07/18, 10:47:29 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Their poop is sfinkh
[13/07/18, 10:47:29 AM] Sush: üòÇ
[13/07/18, 10:47:31 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Stinky
[13/07/18, 10:47:44 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And Serious Men! I really liked how quickly it read
[13/07/18, 10:47:52 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I started reading it this afternoon and I'm done
[13/07/18, 10:48:12 AM] Pranathi Chicago: But it's also interesting and unsettling some of this Ayyan Mani's thoughts
[13/07/18, 10:48:15 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Reminded me of JJ
[13/07/18, 10:48:29 AM] Sush: ya!!
[13/07/18, 10:48:32 AM] Pranathi Chicago: What did you think of it?
[13/07/18, 10:48:36 AM] Sush: i liked it a lot
[13/07/18, 10:48:42 AM] Sush: i read it many years ago
[13/07/18, 10:48:52 AM] Sush: so i only remember broad story
[13/07/18, 10:49:08 AM] Sush: even ayyan mani's kid's plot is fascinating
[13/07/18, 10:49:21 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah I reeeeally like that. The whole play on handicap and genius
[13/07/18, 10:49:25 AM] Sush: yeah!
[13/07/18, 10:49:51 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I also like how Ayyan and the Acharya character end up colluding
[13/07/18, 10:50:06 AM] Sush: yaa! i didn't really see that coming
[13/07/18, 10:50:09 AM] Pranathi Chicago: It ends up being this weird marriage of convenience and grudging respect
[13/07/18, 10:50:15 AM] Sush: correct!
[13/07/18, 10:50:18 AM] Pranathi Chicago: It was counterintuitive
[13/07/18, 10:50:26 AM] Pranathi Chicago: But also so clearly there all along!
[13/07/18, 10:50:33 AM] Sush: acharya's affair is so awks
[13/07/18, 10:50:37 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Soooo awks
[13/07/18, 10:50:43 AM] Pranathi Chicago: It made me very uncomfortable to read
[13/07/18, 10:50:50 AM] Sush: yeah :/ can 100% see it happening
[13/07/18, 10:50:54 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Especially the description of the sex scene which honestly was rape
[13/07/18, 10:51:03 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And it scared me tbh
[13/07/18, 10:51:16 AM] Sush: no???
[13/07/18, 10:51:23 AM] Pranathi Chicago: She doesn't say once that she likes it or even consents
[13/07/18, 10:51:32 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And he's like forcing her. He's her dad's she
[13/07/18, 10:51:33 AM] Pranathi Chicago: She
[13/07/18, 10:51:36 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Age
[13/07/18, 10:51:45 AM] Pranathi Chicago: To me that is terrrrrifying
[13/07/18, 10:51:46 AM] Sush: v v unsettling
[13/07/18, 10:52:10 AM] Sush: ugh apparently sadanand menon was in a 'relationship' with someone in the dept
[13/07/18, 10:52:10 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And the only reason he concedes is because of his bruised ego that she's been ignoring him
[13/07/18, 10:52:32 AM] Pranathi Chicago: It just made me despise men more
[13/07/18, 10:52:39 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Ughhhh ours or ACJ?
[13/07/18, 10:52:41 AM] Sush: this acharya is a hideous embodiment of straight male brahmin privilege
[13/07/18, 10:52:48 AM] Sush: ours
[13/07/18, 10:52:55 AM] Pranathi Chicago: A student?
[13/07/18, 10:53:03 AM] Sush: apparently
[13/07/18, 10:53:06 AM] Sush: no idea who
[13/07/18, 10:54:16 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Damn I find that so creepy
[13/07/18, 10:54:21 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I knew him before insti
[13/07/18, 10:54:27 AM] Sush: oh yeah?
[13/07/18, 10:54:40 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I was part of some dance documentary for my teacher
[13/07/18, 10:54:47 AM] Pranathi Chicago: So we spent a few days filming in Spaces
[13/07/18, 10:54:51 AM] Sush: ohhh
[13/07/18, 10:54:53 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And she and Sadanand were very close
[13/07/18, 10:55:09 AM] Pranathi Chicago: It's weird but not surprising to see this stuff come out about him
[13/07/18, 10:55:21 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I honestly just don't trust men
[13/07/18, 10:55:35 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Even reading the Acharya bit, I was like ofc he would
[13/07/18, 10:55:43 AM] Sush: yeah :/
[13/07/18, 10:55:50 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I hated how he described signs of his wife aging
[13/07/18, 10:55:57 AM] Pranathi Chicago: It was so misogynistic
[13/07/18, 10:56:00 AM] Sush: they give us exactly 0 reasons to trust / respect them
[13/07/18, 10:56:02 AM] Sush: i knowwwww
[13/07/18, 10:56:19 AM] Sush: that reminded me of siddharth
[13/07/18, 10:56:20 AM] Pranathi Chicago: It made me crave a woman author but even that doesn't really mean anything
[13/07/18, 10:56:27 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Ew I hate Siddharth
[13/07/18, 10:56:37 AM] Sush: i'm sure acharya was no looker
[13/07/18, 10:56:44 AM] Sush: and never worked out a day in his life
[13/07/18, 10:56:49 AM] Sush: or ironed his freaking clothes
[13/07/18, 10:56:50 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Brb? Having dinner! Sorry

[13/07/18, 11:18:26 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Back!
[13/07/18, 11:18:52 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah, there's a point when Acharya's wife leaves off to Chennai and he's like ummm where do I get fresh underwear
[13/07/18, 11:19:24 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I was really annoyed by the silencing around women characters in that book. None of the chapters are told from any of the female characters' perspectives
[13/07/18, 4:07:15 PM] Sush: Sorry I fell asleeeep
[13/07/18, 4:07:22 PM] Sush: Ugh ya asshole

[13/07/18, 9:41:08 PM] Pranathi Chicago: You cooked something yem yem
[13/07/18, 9:41:14 PM] Sush: Naaah
[13/07/18, 9:41:24 PM] Sush: I barely got out of bed today ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

[13/07/18, 9:41:49 PM] Sush: Did you enjoy he food in Gangtok??
[13/07/18, 9:41:54 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Ugh I know those days. It feels luxurious until it doesn't and then you start feeling shitty
[13/07/18, 9:42:01 PM] Sush: Exactlyyy
[13/07/18, 9:42:25 PM] Sush: I think literally my body can‚Äôt handle it
[13/07/18, 9:42:45 PM] Pranathi Chicago: It was decent! Our resort's food was incrediblyyyy overpriced. A plate of parathas with two pieces was 500 rupees
[13/07/18, 9:42:53 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Plus it tasted like shite
[13/07/18, 9:43:04 PM] Sush: I also like this

[13/07/18, 10:00:26 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Which is not even nice so ugh what's the point
[13/07/18, 10:00:37 PM] Sush: kodamolaga it seems üòÇ
[13/07/18, 10:00:42 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I told my dad
[13/07/18, 10:00:47 PM] Pranathi Chicago: That he gave me the ugliest nose
[13/07/18, 10:00:55 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I think he felt sad. He hid his nose lol
[13/07/18, 10:01:08 PM] Sush: üòÇüòÇ
[13/07/18, 10:01:14 PM] Sush: Why you don‚Äôt like your nose
[13/07/18, 10:01:25 PM] Sush: It‚Äôs a nice nose only!
[13/07/18, 10:01:50 PM] Pranathi Chicago: It's an okayyyy nose
[13/07/18, 10:02:02 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Mom has waaay cuter nose
[13/07/18, 10:02:10 PM] Sush: Your mom is so small
[13/07/18, 10:02:18 PM] Pranathi Chicago: No?
[13/07/18, 10:02:26 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Gives me a complex lo
[13/07/18, 10:02:27 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Lol
[13/07/18, 10:02:37 PM] Sush: You are also tiny
[13/07/18, 10:02:39 PM] Sush: See that photo
[13/07/18, 10:02:52 PM] Pranathi Chicago: You should see her thighs tho man
[13/07/18, 10:03:05 PM] Pranathi Chicago: They're like white people thighs
[13/07/18, 10:03:32 PM] Pranathi Chicago: But it's sad because she's only that way since she has thyroidism
[13/07/18, 10:03:36 PM] Sush: Ohhh
[13/07/18, 10:03:40 PM] Sush: Paapa!
[13/07/18, 10:03:40 PM] Pranathi Chicago: She doesn't even want to be so thin I think
[13/07/18, 10:03:55 PM] Sush: I miss my depression weight üò≠
[13/07/18, 10:04:06 PM] Sush: Clothes fit me so easily
[13/07/18, 10:04:13 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Haha don't say like thatttt
[13/07/18, 10:04:21 PM] Pranathi Chicago: You're so much happier now and that counts for something
[13/07/18, 10:04:31 PM] Pranathi Chicago: A lot of somethings
[13/07/18, 10:04:41 PM] Pranathi Chicago: But also I hear you. Since coming back I've put on some four five kilos
[13/07/18, 10:04:57 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I miss being able to watch my diet but at the same time I love home food
[13/07/18, 10:05:01 PM] Sush: but I was so hot üò≠
[13/07/18, 10:05:13 PM] Sush: Stock up on Home food!
[13/07/18, 10:05:12 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Why does being thin always have to be at a cost!
[13/07/18, 10:05:17 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Happiness, food
[13/07/18, 10:05:22 PM] Sush: That will go off when you return
[13/07/18, 10:05:25 PM] Pranathi Chicago: You are SOOOO
not even now!
[13/07/18, 10:05:45 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Perhaps hotter because you don't have circles round your eyes and laughter comes easily and all that
[13/07/18, 10:05:58 PM] Sush: I acquired a jawline and collarbones for a brief period and lost them promptly
[13/07/18, 10:11:30 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Haha both of which you still have
[13/07/18, 10:11:39 PM] Pranathi Chicago: You are just seeing yourself with harsh goggles
[13/07/18, 10:11:44 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Hoggles
[13/07/18, 10:11:47 PM] Sush: buried under mounds of flesh!
[13/07/18, 10:12:06 PM] Pranathi Chicago: No I refuse to let you see yourself like that
[13/07/18, 10:12:13 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Imagine if you said that about me
‚Äé[13/07/18, 10:12:22 PM] Sush: ‚Äéimage omitted
[13/07/18, 10:12:25 PM] Pranathi Chicago: It would very hurtful
[13/07/18, 10:12:31 PM] Pranathi Chicago: So you don't say about yourself also
[13/07/18, 10:12:39 PM] Sush: Trueeeee
[13/07/18, 10:12:43 PM] Sush: I‚Äôm just wallowing
[13/07/18, 10:12:43 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Flowers so niceeeeee
[13/07/18, 10:12:49 PM] Sush: Ok I will step out of the house
[13/07/18, 10:12:51 PM] Pranathi Chicago: You bought?
[13/07/18, 10:12:57 PM] Sush: Joanna brought!
[13/07/18, 10:13:01 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yes you must get out and breathe night air
[13/07/18, 10:13:07 PM] Pranathi Chicago: She also seems to know how to show up
[13/07/18, 10:13:09 PM] Pranathi Chicago: With flowers!

[14/07/18, 12:19:25 AM] Sush: Hiiiii
[14/07/18, 12:19:37 AM] Sush: Yes I am hanging out with him tomorrow
[14/07/18, 12:19:47 AM] Sush: üòä
[14/07/18, 12:19:56 AM] Sush: Almost home now
[14/07/18, 12:20:03 AM] Sush: Went for a walk, drank a beer
[14/07/18, 12:20:47 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Niiiiiice
[14/07/18, 12:20:51 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Sounds lovely!
[14/07/18, 12:20:55 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Where did you get beer?
[14/07/18, 12:20:59 AM] Sush: Jimmy‚Äôs
[14/07/18, 12:21:19 AM] Sush: We tried to go to Ida noyes but they close at 11 in the summer it seems
[14/07/18, 12:21:29 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Oh lame Ida Noyes
[14/07/18, 12:21:38 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I just spoke to Tara
[14/07/18, 12:21:41 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Lol
[14/07/18, 12:21:54 AM] Pranathi Chicago: It made me feel depressed slightly
[14/07/18, 12:22:11 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Do you feel better now that you've been out?
[14/07/18, 12:22:39 AM] Sush: Ayyo how is she
[14/07/18, 12:22:44 AM] Sush: I do feel better!
[14/07/18, 12:23:15 AM] Pranathi Chicago: She's annoying. I don't think we should be friends
[14/07/18, 12:23:47 AM] Pranathi Chicago: She went out for dinner and drinks and all okay. I was trying to ask her about that but she got stuck on some story about work and watching the match and how fun it is to chat with some dude who's a trader
[14/07/18, 12:24:06 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And then I told her about Sikkim and she was like, "Nice nice, then what else?" After I went on for like five mins
[14/07/18, 12:24:20 AM] Sush: Pah
[14/07/18, 12:24:24 AM] Pranathi Chicago: She just has no imagination.
[14/07/18, 12:24:29 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I pretended my mom was calling me and hung up
[14/07/18, 12:24:40 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I feel slightly bad but also she's stopped making an effort too
[14/07/18, 12:25:00 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I think maybe I was too obvious when she came to Chicago that I wasn't interested in her work life.
[14/07/18, 12:25:04 AM] Sush: It sounds like you consistently feel worse after speaking to her as compared to before
[14/07/18, 12:25:06 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And that's all she wanted to talk about
[14/07/18, 12:25:16 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah. That's a pretty bad sign no. She takes no interest in my life
[14/07/18, 12:25:23 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Plus I get this sense that she thinks my work is crap
[14/07/18, 12:25:34 AM] Sush: Have you tried telling her you feel like she takes no interest?
[14/07/18, 12:25:52 AM] Sush: Obvs that‚Äôs no easy conversation
[14/07/18, 12:26:05 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I feel bad for saying this, but I don't know if I care enough to have that conversation.
[14/07/18, 12:26:17 AM] Pranathi Chicago: She just doesn't care about the same things that I do. And I don't care about the things that she does.
[14/07/18, 12:26:29 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I don't want to hear her judgment of my research.
[14/07/18, 12:26:37 AM] Sush: that's entirely fair
[14/07/18, 12:26:39 AM] Pranathi Chicago: She tried to get into an argument with me about qualitative work.
[14/07/18, 12:26:55 AM] Sush: ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄ
[14/07/18, 12:26:55 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And I don't want to hear it from her because it's aggravating after she ignores every other attempt to make conversation.
[14/07/18, 12:27:08 AM] Sush: totally reasonable
[14/07/18, 12:27:23 AM] Pranathi Chicago: She's just also really selfish. I don't like that. And if I told her also, she'd at most try to pretend she cares for my sake.
[14/07/18, 12:27:28 AM] Pranathi Chicago: She doesn't really give a rat's ass what I do.
[14/07/18, 12:27:51 AM] Pranathi Chicago: So I think that's over, and we'll probably be cordial but no more.
[14/07/18, 12:27:59 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I think it was easier to be friends with her when I was dating Nick.
[14/07/18, 12:28:16 AM] Sush: i guess she understood him>
[14/07/18, 12:28:19 AM] Pranathi Chicago: They were both so similar. Obsessed with money, status. So being friends with her was almost validating of Nick's flaws.
[14/07/18, 12:28:26 AM] Sush: hmm
[14/07/18, 12:28:42 AM] Sush: that sounds tiresome to be very proximate to
[14/07/18, 12:28:45 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And vice versa
[14/07/18, 12:29:10 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah. I think it's okay to let this friendship go. I don't think she's that desperate to hold on either.
[14/07/18, 12:29:29 AM] Pranathi Chicago: She has enough new friends and I've only been reaching out the past few times anyway.
[14/07/18, 12:29:35 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Ugh it just makes me feel sad though.
[14/07/18, 12:29:46 AM] Sush: that is sad :(
[14/07/18, 12:29:50 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Anywayyyy, that's life I guess.
[14/07/18, 12:30:00 AM] Sush: but also valid and legitimate if you want to distance yourself
[14/07/18, 12:30:47 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah. I don't like how I feel around her.
[14/07/18, 12:30:53 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Or how I feel like I'm perceived by her.
[14/07/18, 12:31:16 AM] Pranathi Chicago: As some sort of hippie freewheeling no good loser with not an ounce of pragmatism
[14/07/18, 12:31:32 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Maybe it's in my head also
[14/07/18, 12:31:35 AM] Sush: that's absurd, at best
[14/07/18, 12:31:37 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I dunno
[14/07/18, 12:31:52 AM] Sush: not your perception of what she feels, but if that's how she sees you
[14/07/18, 12:32:05 AM] Pranathi Chicago: She definitely thinks I'm all faff
[14/07/18, 12:32:14 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I told you about that thing she said the first time I visited New York?
[14/07/18, 12:32:24 AM] Sush: lol she literally said she makes shit up for her boss
[14/07/18, 12:32:32 AM] Sush: how is ANYONE faff
[14/07/18, 12:32:44 AM] Pranathi Chicago: How she doesn't respect people like me who do academia? She said that Adi's the real changemaker because he's staying in  India and he's committed to changing the system
[14/07/18, 12:32:51 AM] Pranathi Chicago: As opposed to me who won't make any direct chagne
[14/07/18, 12:32:53 AM] Pranathi Chicago: *change
[14/07/18, 12:32:55 AM] Pranathi Chicago: In as many words
[14/07/18, 12:33:08 AM] Sush: what change is she effecting on freaking wall street baap
[14/07/18, 12:33:16 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And then I went off and cried in one corner of Columbia lolol
[14/07/18, 12:33:21 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Which was ironic
[14/07/18, 12:33:29 AM] Pranathi Chicago: She doesn't claim to be making change it seems. As though I claimed lol
[14/07/18, 12:33:33 AM] Sush: noooo she's a dumbo it sounds like
[14/07/18, 12:33:41 AM] Pranathi Chicago: She's a bit mean, yeah
[14/07/18, 12:33:46 AM] Pranathi Chicago: My parents will say it's because she's Mallu
[14/07/18, 12:33:49 AM] Sush: means zero nuance / breadth of thought
[14/07/18, 12:33:50 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And Mallu Christian at that hahaha
[14/07/18, 12:33:51 AM] Sush: hahaha
[14/07/18, 12:33:59 AM] Sush: baap she's on wall street
[14/07/18, 12:34:06 AM] Sush: and thinks traders are amaze
[14/07/18, 12:34:15 AM] Sush: take lite what she thinks
[14/07/18, 12:34:24 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah true

[15/07/18, 9:07:00 AM] Sush: "Speaking to someone and realised: ‚Äúbeing well-read‚Äù is as much about perception as it is about actually having read many books. If you read a lot of books and no one hears what you think, did you really read a lot of books? It‚Äôs key to assert and share"

[16/07/18, 12:18:44 AM] Pranathi Chicago: She's fine. She's a lawyer doing human rights stuff, which means she doesn't get any weekends off. And she's dating one guy
[16/07/18, 12:18:55 AM] Pranathi Chicago: It sounds like they are too codependent tbh
[16/07/18, 12:19:00 AM] Sush: Ohhh
[16/07/18, 12:19:08 AM] Pranathi Chicago: She doesn't have any friends. And when she tries to make friends he feels like he's made a second priority it seems
[16/07/18, 12:19:09 AM] Pranathi Chicago: :/
[16/07/18, 12:19:10 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Lame
[16/07/18, 12:19:16 AM] Sush: Ayyo
[16/07/18, 12:19:23 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Men are so dumb and toxic
[16/07/18, 12:19:40 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I feel like I was too forceful in telling her to pack him and make some friends lol
[16/07/18, 12:19:54 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Anyway, how was walk? :)
[16/07/18, 12:20:08 AM] Sush: üòÖ maybe it‚Äôll do her good!
[16/07/18, 12:20:11 AM] Sush: It was very nice
[16/07/18, 12:20:28 AM] Sush: We went down to the law school and splashed about in the reflecting pool and came back
[16/07/18, 12:21:01 AM] Pranathi Chicago: So cute!
[16/07/18, 12:21:09 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I like these little moonlit walks you're having with Riddhima
[16/07/18, 12:21:10 AM] Pranathi Chicago: So romantic
[16/07/18, 12:21:13 AM] Sush: Ya!
[16/07/18, 12:21:20 AM] Sush: I told her about Nikki today
[16/07/18, 12:21:30 AM] Sush: I think that‚Äôs kind of a milestone in my friendships
[16/07/18, 12:21:50 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Oh wow. How did she react?
[16/07/18, 12:22:07 AM] Sush: She listened very nicely
[16/07/18, 12:22:21 AM] Sush: I like her economy with words sometimes haha
[16/07/18, 12:22:36 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Haha she seems very hardy and practical
[16/07/18, 12:22:42 AM] Sush: Ya!
[16/07/18, 12:22:48 AM] Sush: and she also shows up I think
[16/07/18, 12:23:23 AM] Sush: So many new restaurants in Chennai no??
[16/07/18, 12:23:48 AM] Sush: Ohhh listen can I ask you for a favour
[16/07/18, 12:23:51 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah she seems to be such a good friend to you
[16/07/18, 12:24:09 AM] Sush: Feel free to say no -  I totally understand space is scarce when returning from India
[16/07/18, 12:24:17 AM] Sush: My sister has offered me her old camera
[16/07/18, 12:24:31 AM] Sush: Do you think you‚Äôll have space to bring it?
[16/07/18, 12:24:42 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yes yes, no worries at all. :)
[16/07/18, 12:24:51 AM] Pranathi Chicago: It's not like I'm bringing that much also
[16/07/18, 12:24:55 AM] Sush: Sure no? It‚Äôs like a dslr
[16/07/18, 12:25:06 AM] Sush: Not huge or anything
[16/07/18, 12:25:16 AM] Pranathi Chicago: If she can just pack it and give me so that it's secure, that would be great
[16/07/18, 12:25:20 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I don't want it to break or something
[16/07/18, 12:25:35 AM] Sush: Ya! My dad is in Chennai haha he loves that shit
[16/07/18, 12:25:42 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And so exciting!! DSLR. I've been on the lookout for one but they're so expensive haha
[16/07/18, 12:25:49 AM] Sush: They are!!
[16/07/18, 12:26:00 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Loves packing things securely ah?
[16/07/18, 12:26:02 AM] Sush: My sister doesn‚Äôt use this one anymore it was like her starter camera
[16/07/18, 12:26:08 AM] Sush: Ya he loves packing stuff weirdo
[16/07/18, 12:26:24 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Very nice! That'll be such a nice hobby to cultivate!
[16/07/18, 12:26:39 AM] Sush: Ya! I already enjoy taking pictures on my phone
[16/07/18, 12:26:46 AM] Sush: It‚Äôll give me something to walk around for
[16/07/18, 12:26:52 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And what are the two other things you wanted?
[16/07/18, 12:26:59 AM] Pranathi Chicago: That lipstick and one more thing
[16/07/18, 12:27:11 AM] Sush: Oh ya scarlet drill!
[16/07/18, 12:27:33 AM] Sush: Other thing was Meenakshi ammal but pack that - I‚Äôll get after I move to new place
[16/07/18, 12:28:23 AM] Sush: Lipstick don‚Äôt go out of your way at all - not super important or anything
[16/07/18, 12:28:35 AM] Pranathi Chicago: There's a Health and Glow by where I live so it should be easy only!
[16/07/18, 12:28:43 AM] Sush: Ok yay!
[16/07/18, 12:28:45 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And I'll see if I can get Meenakshi  Ammal also.
[16/07/18, 12:28:57 AM] Sush: No Meenakshi ammal will be heavy also
[16/07/18, 12:29:31 AM] Sush: and maybe I can flick my sister‚Äôs copy when I go üëª
[16/07/18, 12:29:43 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Haha okay got it :)
[16/07/18, 12:29:58 AM] Sush: Have you had any new interviews?
[16/07/18, 12:30:19 AM] Pranathi Chicago: A few more I'm trying to line up. One guy who does hiphop and gaana
[16/07/18, 12:30:21 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Some MC Vijay
[16/07/18, 12:30:26 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And also a bunch of Carnatic people
[16/07/18, 12:30:52 AM] Pranathi Chicago: These gaana artists only I'm feeling intimidated to meet alone, and I also feel vacation inertia all of a sudden. Like I just want to sit at home and read books
[16/07/18, 12:31:04 AM] Sush: Nice! It‚Äôs so fascinating how non Brahmin Tamil boys find a resonance in hip hop and rap
[16/07/18, 12:31:14 AM] Sush: Even the dancing, no?
[16/07/18, 12:31:23 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah! I guess it makes a lot of sense
[16/07/18, 12:31:28 AM] Sush: Fair enough!
[16/07/18, 12:31:35 AM] Pranathi Chicago: There's an obvious undertone of resistance that they see as similar to their art
[16/07/18, 12:31:44 AM] Sush: Like an expression of resistance ?
[16/07/18, 12:31:47 AM] Sush: Ya!!
[16/07/18, 12:31:47 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And this aspirational character of the music also
[16/07/18, 12:31:53 AM] Sush: So true
[16/07/18, 12:31:55 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Kaasu, panam, dhuddu, money money
[16/07/18, 12:32:05 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Lol
[16/07/18, 12:32:12 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Bling, gold, Bugatti
[16/07/18, 12:32:16 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Same to same ditto sentiment
[16/07/18, 12:32:17 AM] Sush: üí∏üí∏üí∏
[16/07/18, 12:32:56 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Btw!
[16/07/18, 12:33:02 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I went to CreaShakti play with Yashasvini
[16/07/18, 12:33:06 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Did I tell you?
[16/07/18, 12:33:16 AM] Sush: Ohh! No you didn‚Äôt! Tell meee
[16/07/18, 12:33:18 AM] Pranathi Chicago: This was day before
[16/07/18, 12:33:20 AM] Sush: Was it Dolls?
[16/07/18, 12:33:27 AM] Pranathi Chicago: So it's that Dushyanth's play. She asked me to come along
[16/07/18, 12:33:28 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah, Dolls!
[16/07/18, 12:33:35 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Namita was in it also, and some people I know from school times
[16/07/18, 12:33:38 AM] Sush: Oh nice! How was it?
[16/07/18, 12:33:53 AM] Pranathi Chicago: That Dushyanth kept saying how I was a CS product and I didn't know how to tell him I've never acted in a single one of his plays lol
[16/07/18, 12:33:55 AM] Sush: I talked to Dushyanth in December and he was v excited about it
[16/07/18, 12:34:00 AM] Pranathi Chicago: But he let us watch it for free
[16/07/18, 12:34:08 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Which I thought was very cute and nice!
[16/07/18, 12:34:10 AM] Sush: üòÇüòÇ
[16/07/18, 12:34:14 AM] Sush: So sweet
[16/07/18, 12:34:18 AM] Pranathi Chicago: It was pretty decent! I liked some of the stories a lot
[16/07/18, 12:34:23 AM] Pranathi Chicago: The rest I found slightly entitled
[16/07/18, 12:34:29 AM] Pranathi Chicago: There was one girl, Subhiksha or something
[16/07/18, 12:34:31 AM] Sush: Each actor wrote it herself no?
[16/07/18, 12:34:39 AM] Sush: Subhiksha Raman?
[16/07/18, 12:34:50 AM] Sush: Lol I follow her on insta she seems to be the worssssttt
[16/07/18, 12:34:55 AM] Sush: I hate-follow her
[16/07/18, 12:35:20 AM] Pranathi Chicago: She told some dumb story about how her biggest bane in life is that she has rich daddy who's tryign to give her money. And she did some monoacting level piece about being in an airport and having the *worst* day because she lost her luggage and now she has to pay for extra luggage or some crap
[16/07/18, 12:35:28 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And it ends with her asking her dad for money
[16/07/18, 12:35:31 AM] Pranathi Chicago: It was so cringeworthy
[16/07/18, 12:35:38 AM] Sush: Ewwww
[16/07/18, 12:35:56 AM] Sush: YAK
[16/07/18, 12:36:00 AM] Pranathi Chicago: She also name-dropped and talked about how she met Dhoni and Irfan Pathan because she dropped her dad's name
[16/07/18, 12:36:06 AM] Pranathi Chicago: He's some cricket jersey exporter or something
[16/07/18, 12:36:08 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I eye rolled so hard
[16/07/18, 12:36:10 AM] Sush: Grosssssssss
[16/07/18, 12:36:48 AM] Sush: Oh I‚Äôve unfollowed her lol I wanted to show you
[16/07/18, 12:36:51 AM] Sush: She‚Äôs terrible
[16/07/18, 12:36:53 AM] Pranathi Chicago: One of my friends also performed. I know her from school, who I knew sort of peripherally really but she showed up at culturals allllll the time.
[16/07/18, 12:36:58 AM] Sush: Her account is private now
[16/07/18, 12:37:04 AM] Sush: How was she?
[16/07/18, 12:37:09 AM] Sush: And how was Namita?
[16/07/18, 12:37:12 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Edho terrible sentence construction but you get the drift
[16/07/18, 12:37:25 AM] Pranathi Chicago: She did a piece on when she first discovered she got vitiligo
[16/07/18, 12:37:38 AM] Sush: What is that?
[16/07/18, 12:37:40 AM] Pranathi Chicago: It was quite good actually. It was less acting, and more of a TED talk type thing
[16/07/18, 12:37:48 AM] Pranathi Chicago: It's the thing that gives you patches of lighter skin
[16/07/18, 12:37:55 AM] Sush: Ohh ok ok
[16/07/18, 12:37:59 AM] Sush: Interesting!
[16/07/18, 12:37:59 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Her mom also spoke
[16/07/18, 12:38:18 AM] Pranathi Chicago: She's that Jayanthi Sabesh or whatever. I hated her piece. It was about how her maamiyar was so cool and helped everyone in that family become successful
[16/07/18, 12:38:27 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Although I think Dushyanth helped write parts of that piece
[16/07/18, 12:38:36 AM] Sush: ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
[16/07/18, 12:38:58 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Namita's piece was good. It was about beauty standards. She has curly hair now. I didn't even realize how curly her hair was. She did a whole thing on straighteners and mascara. But it was all like spoken word
[16/07/18, 12:39:04 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I was genuinely happy to see her though!
[16/07/18, 12:39:15 AM] Pranathi Chicago: She was also very surprised to see me there and she was pretty sweet
[16/07/18, 12:39:20 AM] Sush: Nice!
[16/07/18, 12:39:43 AM] Sush: I didn‚Äôt know her but was wary because people called her baby snega lol
[16/07/18, 12:39:45 AM] Pranathi Chicago: That girl's a very good writer.
[16/07/18, 12:40:12 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Haha she was very strange in insti. But Yashasvini and I were talking about how everyone in insti sort of put on a public facade and we didn't really know anybody beyond a quick fix label
[16/07/18, 12:40:26 AM] Sush: Correct
[16/07/18, 12:40:35 AM] Sush: How is Yashasvini?
[16/07/18, 12:40:57 AM] Pranathi Chicago: But paavam she's graduated and all. I felt so old! She's doing theater full time now and lives in Virugambakkam or something
[16/07/18, 12:41:06 AM] Sush: That‚Äôs so cool!
[16/07/18, 12:41:12 AM] Sush: Is she still dating Vaishwath
[16/07/18, 12:41:19 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yashasvini is fine! She got engaged no. She's also starting a new job next month
[16/07/18, 12:41:33 AM] Pranathi Chicago: No idea. We didn't really hang out that much also! Namita was busy being with the rest of the cast and all
[16/07/18, 12:41:38 AM] Sush: Oh yaaa nice! She finished her teaching stint no?
[16/07/18, 12:41:56 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yep, she finished and now she's chilling for a few weeks before starting work
[16/07/18, 12:42:01 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Paavam she has some back condition and all
[16/07/18, 12:42:05 AM] Sush: Nice
[16/07/18, 12:42:07 AM] Pranathi Chicago: So she's been getting intense physio
[16/07/18, 12:42:08 AM] Sush: Ohh paapa!
[16/07/18, 12:42:15 AM] Pranathi Chicago: That's why she's at home now
[16/07/18, 12:42:29 AM] Pranathi Chicago: She has this crippling back pain and her muscles in the lower half of her body need repairing
[16/07/18, 12:42:36 AM] Sush: Oh gosh :(
[16/07/18, 12:42:44 AM] Pranathi Chicago: She was telling me about this prof Joe Karackattu! You remember him?
[16/07/18, 12:42:50 AM] Sush: Ya!
[16/07/18, 12:42:59 AM] Sush: He was very very nice to Gayathri
[16/07/18, 12:43:08 AM] Sush: What did she say I‚Äôm so curious
[16/07/18, 12:43:16 AM] Sush: Wait I‚Äôll call?
[16/07/18, 12:43:28 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Paavam this happened to him: https://www.newsbytesapp.com/timeline/Delhi/26962/121384/delhi-hc-rules-against-iit-m-professor-s-child-custody-appeal

[16/07/18, 9:45:12 PM] Sush: totally understand
[16/07/18, 9:45:22 PM] Sush: it's really some split existence

[16/07/18, 9:46:54 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I started Zadie Smith's The Autograph Man
[16/07/18, 9:47:04 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Barely a chapter in, so don't know how I feel about it yet. But I've always enjoyed her writing

[16/07/18, 9:47:24 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I hope if I become an academic and decide to write fiction, it won't look like that
[16/07/18, 9:47:32 PM] Sush: my phone autocorrects teju to feku
[16/07/18, 9:47:41 PM] Sush: couldn't be better machine learning
[16/07/18, 9:47:55 PM] Sush: yaaaa
[16/07/18, 9:48:05 PM] Pranathi Chicago: "As I saw the sunset, I was reminded of Vivaldi's Four Seasons because I have a stick up my bum and can only make obscure references to make other people feel inferior and to make them take the effort of Googling."

[16/07/18, 9:48:17 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Hahaha Teju to Feku lolol.
[16/07/18, 9:48:22 PM] Sush: yak
[16/07/18, 9:48:29 PM] Sush: he clearly has no ideas that can stand on their own
[16/07/18, 9:49:00 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah. He can't even thread together a simple plot
[16/07/18, 9:49:16 PM] Pranathi Chicago: It's like when an artist drops a can of paint on his canvas and calls it post-modern.
[16/07/18, 9:49:16 PM] Sush: first 20% of the book - no plot yet
[16/07/18, 9:49:24 PM] Sush: except some random girlfriend in sf
[16/07/18, 9:49:26 PM] Sush: lol so gross
[16/07/18, 9:49:26 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Btw, Uday loves Teju Cole
[16/07/18, 9:49:30 PM] Pranathi Chicago: He only recommended to me. :/
[16/07/18, 9:49:32 PM] Sush: lolol
[16/07/18, 9:49:47 PM] Sush: i was kind of amused at the way he talked about ferrante
[16/07/18, 9:49:50 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I wonder if only men can read that without the sense that it's terrible
[16/07/18, 9:49:56 PM] Pranathi Chicago: What did he say?
[16/07/18, 9:50:17 PM] Sush: like she was some turning point in his life - only then did it dawn on him that women have complex inner lives or smth like that
[16/07/18, 9:50:34 PM] Sush: i'm being a bit reductionist while paraphrasing, but sort of to that effect
[16/07/18, 9:50:42 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Ughhh
[16/07/18, 9:50:57 PM] Sush: i had never seen ferrante as 'women's writing'
[16/07/18, 9:50:57 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Uday will read some very high faluting philosophers just for fun with no sense of irony
[16/07/18, 9:51:02 PM] Sush: lolol
[16/07/18, 9:51:02 PM] Pranathi Chicago: That's the kind of person he is.
[16/07/18, 9:51:09 PM] Pranathi Chicago: We don't even know if Ferrante is really a woman
[16/07/18, 9:51:21 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Wouldn't it be the coolest thing if it was a man using a woman's name as a pseudonym
[16/07/18, 9:51:25 PM] Sush: i feel like she HAS to be
[16/07/18, 9:51:38 PM] Sush: men don't write women that well
[16/07/18, 9:51:49 PM] Sush: it's too intimate, she knows too much
[16/07/18, 9:52:07 PM] Pranathi Chicago: That's true
[16/07/18, 9:52:33 PM] Sush: i can't imagine a man writing that book without at least 300% more references to lila's boobs :P
[16/07/18, 9:52:39 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Hahaha
[16/07/18, 9:52:55 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Honestly that's how I found out Sidney Sheldon was a man
[16/07/18, 9:53:01 PM] Sush: hahahaha!
[16/07/18, 9:53:04 PM] Pranathi Chicago: It was just so sexualizing
[16/07/18, 9:53:26 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Uday is one trippy fellow
[16/07/18, 9:53:37 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Btw, word of warning. If he invites you to his house, find a way not to go unless you want to be attacked by his cat
[16/07/18, 9:53:38 PM] Sush: he's sooo earnest it seems
[16/07/18, 9:53:43 PM] Sush: omg ok
[16/07/18, 9:53:52 PM] Pranathi Chicago: That thing pounces from across the room and it literally attached itself to my shin with its jaws
[16/07/18, 9:53:55 PM] Sush: i'll say i have allergy
[16/07/18, 9:53:56 PM] Pranathi Chicago: and it HURT
[16/07/18, 9:53:57 PM] Sush: ewwwww

[16/07/18, 9:55:14 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I know. Pet people are so annoying
[16/07/18, 9:55:24 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I don't know if I could be with someone who wants to have pets
[16/07/18, 9:55:30 PM] Sush: i cant marry a pet owner
[16/07/18, 9:55:32 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Maybe a cute, well-behaved dog
[16/07/18, 9:55:33 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Definitely not a cat
[16/07/18, 9:55:44 PM] Sush: i'd prefer a little cat
[16/07/18, 9:55:43 PM] Pranathi Chicago: But dogs require so much attention and care
[16/07/18, 9:55:52 PM] Sush: or a FOX
[16/07/18, 9:55:53 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I don't know. It all seems too much tbh
[16/07/18, 9:55:55 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I'd prefer a little human
[16/07/18, 9:55:58 PM] Sush: have you seen fox_kuzma?!

[16/07/18, 10:17:37 PM] Pranathi Chicago: But she said usually it has to be frozen off and that's too expensive in America
[16/07/18, 10:17:50 PM] Sush: pfft it isn't embarrassing
[16/07/18, 10:17:51 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I figure they can probably do it here because India
[16/07/18, 10:17:57 PM] Pranathi Chicago: ARE YOU SURE
[16/07/18, 10:17:57 PM] Sush: oh ya true
[16/07/18, 10:18:00 PM] Sush: 100%
[16/07/18, 10:18:05 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I live in mortal embarrassment of this everyday
[16/07/18, 10:18:13 PM] Sush: noooo
[16/07/18, 10:18:22 PM] Sush: people have ALL KINDS OF THINGS on their bodies
[16/07/18, 10:18:28 PM] Sush: i have mad stretch marks
[16/07/18, 10:18:42 PM] Sush: does the skin tag irritate you physically
[16/07/18, 10:18:58 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Not really!
[16/07/18, 10:19:08 PM] Pranathi Chicago: But sometimes I get really self conscious about it
[16/07/18, 10:19:13 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And especially when having sex.
[16/07/18, 10:19:17 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Not that I am having sex
[16/07/18, 10:19:25 PM] Pranathi Chicago: But I don't want it to become some sort of complex
[16/07/18, 10:19:30 PM] Sush: fair
[16/07/18, 10:19:35 PM] Sush: no harm finding out i guess!
[16/07/18, 10:19:51 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And also it just feels like a gross thing
[16/07/18, 10:19:57 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Because ofc I went online and googled it
[16/07/18, 10:20:09 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And people have these discussion boards where they say they're embarrassed about it
[16/07/18, 10:20:18 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Or worse, their partners post saying that they feel turned off by it
[16/07/18, 10:20:28 PM] Pranathi Chicago: UGH but also those people must be idiots
[16/07/18, 10:20:32 PM] Sush: ya!
[16/07/18, 10:20:53 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Raffaella and I were talking about this.
[16/07/18, 10:20:54 PM] Sush: i was convinced that mikhail broke up with me because i have stretch marks for a week or so
[16/07/18, 10:21:09 PM] Pranathi Chicago: She had some procedure and it would leave a scar down there. She didn't want to get it done for the longest time because of how it would look.
[16/07/18, 10:21:26 PM] Pranathi Chicago: But then she was like, if this is the reason someone doesn't want to have sex with me, then I shouldn't be having sex with them in the first place.
[16/07/18, 10:21:40 PM] Sush: true
[16/07/18, 10:21:52 PM] Pranathi Chicago: God. I also have crazy stretch marks. But I think we all need to tell each other it's okay
[16/07/18, 10:21:59 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Normalize the imperfect body
[16/07/18, 10:22:03 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Whatever "imperfect" means
[16/07/18, 10:22:06 PM] Sush: true
[16/07/18, 10:22:08 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Who decides what perfection is anyway.
[16/07/18, 10:22:11 PM] Sush: non airbrushed butts
[16/07/18, 10:22:16 PM] Sush: i hate my butt lol
[16/07/18, 10:22:22 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Ooh I'd follow that Instagram handle.
[16/07/18, 10:22:26 PM] Sush: i think it's strong that's all
[16/07/18, 10:22:34 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I really hate my butt too.
[16/07/18, 10:22:43 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I have scars, stretch marks, now this.
[16/07/18, 10:22:46 PM] Sush: but i did squats the other day and could barely walk for 2 days lol
[16/07/18, 10:23:02 PM] Sush: i wonder if men feel this way at all
[16/07/18, 10:23:27 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Men definitely feel this way. But probably can't articulate it to themselves also
[16/07/18, 10:23:33 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I know Nick was crazy insecure about his body
[16/07/18, 10:23:49 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I think American men especially have crazy body issues
[16/07/18, 10:23:56 PM] Sush: probably
[16/07/18, 10:24:09 PM] Sush: indian men seem happy with their paunches / skinny arms
[16/07/18, 10:24:21 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah. My brother is looking like one uncle and unabashedly eats
[16/07/18, 10:24:24 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I'm almost glad
[16/07/18, 10:24:34 PM] Sush: ya good only!
[16/07/18, 10:24:36 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I'd prefer that to him feeling guilty about eating
[16/07/18, 10:24:38 PM] Sush: unnecessary hangups
[16/07/18, 10:24:40 PM] Pranathi Chicago: But I also envy him.
[16/07/18, 10:24:53 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I wish I could eat that uninhibitedly
[16/07/18, 10:24:57 PM] Sush: ya food is sooo tied with guilt
[16/07/18, 10:25:03 PM] Sush: i enjoyed my little parathas today
[16/07/18, 10:25:11 PM] Sush: they were fun to roll out!
[16/07/18, 10:25:38 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Oh yeahhh!
[16/07/18, 10:25:46 PM] Pranathi Chicago: So fancy! How you made?
[16/07/18, 10:25:46 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Tell me process :)
[16/07/18, 10:25:57 PM] Sush: hahaha
[16/07/18, 10:26:11 PM] Sush: i kneaded off wheat with a little salt, oil and water
[16/07/18, 10:26:18 PM] Sush: left it to rest for 30 mins
[16/07/18, 10:26:54 PM] Sush: then i boiled a baby potato, grated paneer, tiny chopped onions and a little coriander with green chilli, turmeric, salt, ajwain
[16/07/18, 10:27:02 PM] Sush: mashed it together
[16/07/18, 10:27:43 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yummmm
[16/07/18, 10:27:43 PM] Sush: then i tried 2 methods haha - one is roll out two discs and place filling in between, close and roll out and the other is roll out one disc, place filling, close it up and roll out again
[16/07/18, 10:27:46 PM] Pranathi Chicago: That sounds so good
[16/07/18, 10:28:09 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Which worked better?
[16/07/18, 10:28:21 PM] Sush: the second has higher filling to wheat ratio
[16/07/18, 10:28:27 PM] Sush: but the first _looks_ better :P
[16/07/18, 10:28:36 PM] Sush: and rolls beautifully
[16/07/18, 10:28:52 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Ahhh that makes sense!
[16/07/18, 10:29:05 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I am always in favor of high filling to dough ratio though
[16/07/18, 10:29:11 PM] Sush: how did your  birthday dinner turn out?
[16/07/18, 10:29:13 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Especially after mess parathas that were mostly maavu
[16/07/18, 10:29:15 PM] Sush: means your dad's
[16/07/18, 10:29:19 PM] Sush: omg yes
[16/07/18, 10:29:26 PM] Sush: and uncooked slimy onions
[16/07/18, 10:29:31 PM] Pranathi Chicago: My grandmom no, she boils potatoes and then grates them so that it rolls out in the paratha more evenly
[16/07/18, 10:29:41 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Ew yeah, I hated those onions.
[16/07/18, 10:29:47 PM] Sush: ohhh
[16/07/18, 10:29:53 PM] Sush: i should try that!
[16/07/18, 10:29:57 PM] Sush: no lumps
[16/07/18, 10:30:07 PM] Pranathi Chicago: The dinner was so good! I made quesadillas, fajitas and guac
[16/07/18, 10:30:10 PM] Pranathi Chicago: My dad helped cook which was fun
[16/07/18, 10:30:16 PM] Pranathi Chicago: He was such a good little helper
[16/07/18, 10:30:18 PM] Sush: Yammy!

[16/07/18, 10:30:22 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And my mom left the kitchen which was nice
[16/07/18, 10:30:29 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Dude avocados here are HUGE
[16/07/18, 10:30:34 PM] Pranathi Chicago: They're like three times the size of the TI ones
[16/07/18, 10:30:45 PM] Pranathi Chicago: They look very different
[16/07/18, 10:31:46 PM] Sush: Whoaaa
[16/07/18, 10:31:48 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Did I tell you about the etymology of the word "avocado"?
[16/07/18, 10:31:54 PM] Sush: Where you found?
[16/07/18, 10:31:57 PM] Sush: No, say!
[16/07/18, 10:32:06 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Pazhamudir Nilayam! They're everywhere actually
[16/07/18, 10:32:21 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Avocado comes from a Mayan word for testicles. Avocados grow in pairs and they're low-hanging fruit
[16/07/18, 10:32:22 PM] Pranathi Chicago: No joke
[16/07/18, 10:32:26 PM] Sush: Ohhhh

[16/07/18, 10:34:39 PM] Pranathi Chicago: No fail days
[16/07/18, 10:34:51 PM] Pranathi Chicago: All days are what they are only. And you are amazing

[16/07/18, 11:04:22 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I feel so much better sighhh
[16/07/18, 11:04:36 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Sometimes I get stressed when I put off work. Then I get into a rut and I can't do it also and I feel horrible about myself
[16/07/18, 11:36:16 PM] Sush: Good good! Ya that pattern is the worst
[16/07/18, 11:45:23 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I love this Costas
[16/07/18, 11:45:26 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I think he loves me also
[16/07/18, 11:45:38 PM] Pranathi Chicago: He makes me feel so smart. I told him where my interviews are going and he sent me one looooong email in response
[16/07/18, 11:54:02 PM] Sush: that's so nice!
[16/07/18, 11:54:23 PM] Sush: it must be so grounding no? to get this feedback during fieldwork?
[17/07/18, 12:07:49 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yesss it makes me feel less like I'm OB adichufying here

[17/07/18, 6:34:27 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Bad kanaa?
[17/07/18, 6:43:29 AM] Pranathi Chicago: https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/07/gossip-is-good/561737/ Lolol
[17/07/18, 6:51:46 AM] Sush: Hear hear!
[17/07/18, 6:52:12 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I love when news/research can make you feel better about things you're not supposed to be too proud of haha
[17/07/18, 6:53:09 AM] Sush: I knkwüòÇ
[17/07/18, 6:53:28 AM] Sush: My tenth boards English exam essay was about how gossip was therapeutic
[17/07/18, 6:53:29 AM] Sush: Lol
[17/07/18, 6:53:37 AM] Sush: No wonder I didn‚Äôt do well
[17/07/18, 6:53:43 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Hahaha
[17/07/18, 6:53:59 AM] Pranathi Chicago: So trippy
[17/07/18, 6:54:11 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Only you would try to shock the exam correcting people :P
[17/07/18, 6:54:28 AM] Sush: Why for me ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
[17/07/18, 6:54:53 AM] Sush: Some Aunty in Lucknow must‚Äôve been like wtf 3/10
[17/07/18, 6:55:14 AM] Sush: Ok that was ageist and classist
[17/07/18, 6:55:40 AM] Pranathi Chicago: HAhaha
[17/07/18, 6:55:41 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Issok
[17/07/18, 6:55:51 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I feel like all my PCness is being tested so hard being here
[17/07/18, 6:55:58 AM] Sush: hahaha
[17/07/18, 6:56:09 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I was taken by my dad along with mom and brother to visit his friend's family
[17/07/18, 6:56:21 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Which I think is so patriarchal. It's not like my whole family will be prevailed upon to visit my mom's friend
[17/07/18, 6:56:32 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And I hated the idea of it completely because I hate his friend and his family
[17/07/18, 6:56:49 AM] Pranathi Chicago: That uncle made some really awful comment about how they were looking for houses and they wouldn't live in one house because it was a Muslim house
[17/07/18, 6:57:00 AM] Sush: Oh gosh ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
[17/07/18, 6:57:04 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And I mentioned that to my dad later, and he got upset with ME.
[17/07/18, 6:57:16 AM] Pranathi Chicago: He was like, "If you're so judgmental then you won't have any friends. Everyone will have some faults."
[17/07/18, 6:57:31 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And I told him I decide which faults to let slip, and bigotry isn't one.
[17/07/18, 6:57:34 AM] Pranathi Chicago: He got reeeeeally mad.
[17/07/18, 6:57:46 AM] Sush: Ayyo!
[17/07/18, 6:58:03 AM] Sush: So true though that it‚Äôs a personal choice as to which faults you let slip
[17/07/18, 6:58:08 AM] Sush: So nicely you have said
[17/07/18, 6:58:24 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Aww thanks for affirming me ya
[17/07/18, 6:58:30 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I feel like I am going crazy in this house
[17/07/18, 6:58:36 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Like nothing I do is acceptable apparently
[17/07/18, 6:58:41 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I am just holed up in my room pretending to work
[17/07/18, 6:58:55 AM] Sush: Ayyo :( I‚Äôm sorry it feels that way!
[17/07/18, 6:59:01 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I sound like an angsty teenager and I'm whining to you kaalam kathaala!
[17/07/18, 6:59:05 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Sorry!
[17/07/18, 6:59:12 AM] Sush: Hahaha no no I can totally sympathise
[17/07/18, 6:59:26 AM] Sush: I‚Äôve def felt this way at home
[17/07/18, 7:00:00 AM] Sush: Did I tell you my mom and sister literally didn‚Äôt talk to me for like 3 hrs after I said I‚Äôd probably vote congress next election lol
[17/07/18, 7:00:10 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Seriously/
[17/07/18, 7:00:11 AM] Pranathi Chicago: ?
[17/07/18, 7:00:22 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Hahaha sounds like something my family would definitely do
[17/07/18, 7:00:27 AM] Sush: Well they were flabbergasted lol
[17/07/18, 7:00:30 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I mean, first my dad would yell though
[17/07/18, 7:00:36 AM] Sush: and dad was so happy lolol
[17/07/18, 7:00:40 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Hahaha
[17/07/18, 7:01:08 AM] Sush: But ya man my bp shoots up when dad starts discussing Modi
[17/07/18, 7:01:17 AM] Sush: And you end up getting drawn into engaging
[17/07/18, 7:01:23 AM] Sush: However much you want to ignore
[17/07/18, 7:01:30 AM] Sush: Because it‚Äôs such flagrant BS
[17/07/18, 7:01:39 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeahhhh. I wish I had the zen like abilities required to deal with dad-ly creatures
[17/07/18, 7:01:52 AM] Sush: Srsly
[17/07/18, 7:02:00 AM] Sush: Also so unfair that the onus is on us to ignore
[17/07/18, 7:02:12 AM] Sush: Legitimises their behaviour also
[17/07/18, 7:02:17 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah. My mom also knows he's being ridiculous, but asks me to just let it slide
[17/07/18, 7:02:22 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Because "anyway I'm leaving soon"
[17/07/18, 7:02:30 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Which I think is just dumb for the long run
[17/07/18, 7:02:35 AM] Sush: Ya it is
[17/07/18, 7:02:36 AM] Pranathi Chicago: He's going to get more and more set in his ways.
[17/07/18, 7:02:49 AM] Sush: Leaving or not he‚Äôs your dad you‚Äôre his daughter
[17/07/18, 7:02:56 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Literally every time I challenge him, I'm the only one who's challenged him in like forever
[17/07/18, 7:03:11 AM] Pranathi Chicago: My brother is soooo passive man
[17/07/18, 7:03:17 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And he idol worships my dad it feels like
[17/07/18, 7:03:30 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Which annoys me and makes me feel excluded at some level, but also I don't want to be included
[17/07/18, 7:03:37 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Because they're so.... male.
[17/07/18, 7:04:10 AM] Sush: Ya :/ I can see why tambrahm males are also way less likely to challenge status quo
[17/07/18, 7:04:14 AM] Sush: It suits them so nicely
[17/07/18, 7:04:29 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah. My dad rewards him in subtle ways for not challenging him
[17/07/18, 7:04:42 AM] Pranathi Chicago: If I walk into the room, they'll continue the conversation like I didn't just enter
[17/07/18, 7:04:50 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Like zero effort to even explain what they're talking about
[17/07/18, 7:04:59 AM] Pranathi Chicago: That annoying way that men have of just having conversations among themselves.
[17/07/18, 7:05:03 AM] Pranathi Chicago: It's driving me INSANE
[17/07/18, 7:05:04 AM] Sush: omg ya
[17/07/18, 7:05:16 AM] Sush: Purusha pesara
[17/07/18, 7:05:21 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Ewwww
[17/07/18, 7:05:32 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And my mom is also so passive
[17/07/18, 7:05:38 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I try to get her on my side and at least vent sometimes
[17/07/18, 7:05:50 AM] Pranathi Chicago: She'll get worried that I am dissing family members and tell me to shush basically
[17/07/18, 7:05:56 AM] Pranathi Chicago: It's so frustrating.
[17/07/18, 7:06:00 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Okay done with rant, sorry!
[17/07/18, 7:06:02 AM] Sush: That‚Äôs so annoying :/
[17/07/18, 7:06:02 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I am going on an don
[17/07/18, 7:06:04 AM] Pranathi Chicago: *and on
[17/07/18, 7:06:18 AM] Sush: Chee no you have to get it out of your system also
[17/07/18, 7:06:44 AM] Sush: At least to the degree that talking about it can
[17/07/18, 7:06:47 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah. I am actually just deeply disappointed in my lack of allyship with my brother
[17/07/18, 7:06:55 AM] Pranathi Chicago: He just doesn't seem to give a shit how I'm feeling
[17/07/18, 7:07:10 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And I'm almost resentful that I stuck my neck out for him and had that whole yelling match with dad about his depression
[17/07/18, 7:07:23 AM] Sush: That does suck :/
[17/07/18, 7:07:23 AM] Pranathi Chicago: We haven't even talked about his depression once, and he doesn't even try to come talk to me
[17/07/18, 7:07:40 AM] Sush: Oh man that is also so frustratingly male
[17/07/18, 7:07:43 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I tried a few times, we bonded a little over music. But he doesn't ask about my life
[17/07/18, 7:07:53 AM] Pranathi Chicago: He'll just walk behind my dad like a little pet
[17/07/18, 7:08:00 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Ughhhh
[17/07/18, 7:08:02 AM] Pranathi Chicago: It is so male
[17/07/18, 7:08:22 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Anyway, he's going off for a few days to Pilani
[17/07/18, 7:08:34 AM] Pranathi Chicago: He's meeting friends and it was supposed to be his convocation
[17/07/18, 7:08:41 AM] Pranathi Chicago: It'll give us some space I guess
[17/07/18, 7:08:41 AM] Sush: Ohhh
[17/07/18, 7:08:45 AM] Sush: Yeah true
[17/07/18, 7:09:09 AM] Sush: So unfortunate though that he isn‚Äôt seeing you
[17/07/18, 7:09:14 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I think I'm in that really shitty part of being home that's sort of right in the middle. So all the feels of me arriving after forever are gone, and they haven't thought about me leaving yet
[17/07/18, 7:09:27 AM] Sush: Haha I knoowwww
[17/07/18, 7:09:40 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah. I think he gets annoyed at me when I tell him to stop yelling. He's just so loud.
[17/07/18, 7:09:44 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Imagine if Jonathan was your brother
[17/07/18, 7:09:48 AM] Sush: üòÇ
[17/07/18, 7:09:53 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And he was behaving in all these male ways
[17/07/18, 7:10:03 AM] Sush: TAKE UP LESS SPACE
[17/07/18, 7:10:12 AM] Pranathi Chicago: He takes up SO MUCH SPACE
[17/07/18, 7:10:28 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Even the TV, he just assumes it's his to watch unless I ask
[17/07/18, 7:10:34 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And then he'll sigh really loudly and pass me the remote
[17/07/18, 7:10:39 AM] Pranathi Chicago: EW
[17/07/18, 7:10:47 AM] Sush: ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
[17/07/18, 7:10:55 AM] Sush: So freaking male
[17/07/18, 7:11:06 AM] Pranathi Chicago: YUCK. Who will even tell him it's fucked up if not me?
[17/07/18, 7:11:16 AM] Pranathi Chicago: My mom doesn't like me saying aaaanything to him. Not like she says
[17/07/18, 7:11:16 AM] Sush: Ya my dad will also just come change no matter who is watching
[17/07/18, 7:11:19 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And my dad doesn't even notice
[17/07/18, 7:11:25 AM] Sush: We just have to lump it
[17/07/18, 7:11:39 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Ugh. That's so frustrating no.
[17/07/18, 7:11:45 AM] Sush: Extremely
[17/07/18, 7:11:47 AM] Pranathi Chicago: It's just like, "My resources, all mine."
[17/07/18, 7:11:55 AM] Sush: By default
[17/07/18, 7:12:07 AM] Sush: And like you said with the sighing
[17/07/18, 7:12:22 AM] Sush: You took my resources so you‚Äôre forcing me to snatch back
[17/07/18, 7:12:32 AM] Sush: And then when I do you‚Äôre like ugh so rude with the snatching
[17/07/18, 7:13:05 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeahhhh. Even with the yelling. How can he get annoyed? He does it when I'm trying to sleep
[17/07/18, 7:13:14 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And gets annoyed that I can't sleep through his yelling
[17/07/18, 7:13:23 AM] Sush: Lol that‚Äôs nuts
[17/07/18, 7:13:23 AM] Pranathi Chicago: He plays metal music loudly at like 7 in the morning
[17/07/18, 7:13:29 AM] Sush: Nooooo
[17/07/18, 7:13:39 AM] Pranathi Chicago: He's literally a trope of himself
[17/07/18, 7:15:51 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Dude my mom just gave me a "beauty tip"
[17/07/18, 7:15:56 AM] Pranathi Chicago: For my "receding hairline"
[17/07/18, 7:16:07 AM] Pranathi Chicago: She was like, "You were worried about tha tno?
[17/07/18, 7:16:10 AM] Sush: No no no no
[17/07/18, 7:16:15 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And I said no... She goes, "You only said."
[17/07/18, 7:16:22 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I definitely hadn't thought about it
[17/07/18, 7:16:28 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Is my hairline receding?
[17/07/18, 7:16:32 AM] Sush: You have a luscious head of hair!
[17/07/18, 7:16:56 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Ugh my mom is also such a traitor man
[17/07/18, 7:17:15 AM] Sush: Honestly if there‚Äôs one problem you needn‚Äôt worry about it‚Äôs probably that
[17/07/18, 7:17:27 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I actually feel like shit about how I look at home
[17/07/18, 7:17:33 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Which is the opposite of how it should be
[17/07/18, 7:17:37 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I don't even make an effort at home
[17/07/18, 7:17:51 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I wear such shitty clothes and all
[17/07/18, 7:18:02 AM] Sush: And that needs to be ok
[17/07/18, 7:18:06 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I feel also horrible about bitching about my family this much
[17/07/18, 7:18:23 AM] Pranathi Chicago: But I just feel so claustrophobic here sometimes
[17/07/18, 7:18:34 AM] Sush: No I get you‚Äôre at this point where you‚Äôre like I want to be cherishing you idiots but you‚Äôre SO ANNOYING
[17/07/18, 7:18:46 AM] Pranathi Chicago: It's that weird claim that parents seem to have to challenging self-esteem, just because they raised you and shit.
[17/07/18, 7:19:06 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah EXACTLY. Like I'm looking to have a good time but it's literally a comedy of errors constantly
[17/07/18, 7:19:23 AM] Sush: Ugh ya I‚Äôm like you only made me
[17/07/18, 7:19:25 AM] Sush: Now you keep
[17/07/18, 7:19:32 AM] Sush: Take what you made
[17/07/18, 7:20:10 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Haha yeah. I just want them to not be on the project of improving me constantly
[17/07/18, 7:20:40 AM] Pranathi Chicago: They don't seem to see that it's a subjective endeavor and they may as well reconcile themselves to accepting who I am
[17/07/18, 7:23:13 AM] Sush: Fair
[17/07/18, 7:23:35 AM] Sush: Esp annoying because we‚Äôre expected to accept who they are
[17/07/18, 7:23:40 AM] Sush: Without ‚Äòjudgement‚Äô
[17/07/18, 7:28:04 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah.
[17/07/18, 7:28:11 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Gahhhh family's so complicated
[17/07/18, 7:28:14 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Unnecessarily so.

[17/07/18, 11:25:47 AM] Sush: ya very nice email!

[20/07/18, 11:23:57 PM] Pranathi Chicago: It would be funny if I didn't know he hated vegetarianism visceraly
[20/07/18, 11:24:02 PM] Pranathi Chicago: *viscerally
[20/07/18, 11:24:14 PM] Pranathi Chicago: That one time I told you Sneha and I went over for dinner at his place? He didn't make anything veg!

[20/07/18, 11:25:33 PM] Sush: Pah
[20/07/18, 11:25:56 PM] Sush: He told me also that he grew up vegetarian but his Marxist rebellion made him eat him
[20/07/18, 11:25:59 PM] Sush: K
[20/07/18, 11:26:12 PM] Sush: Made him eat meat

[20/07/18, 11:27:45 PM] Sush: Tell him off!
[20/07/18, 11:27:49 PM] Pranathi Chicago: He keeps doing it and I feel like he's goading me into saying something
[20/07/18, 11:27:54 PM] Pranathi Chicago: But then he wins
[20/07/18, 11:28:06 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Cause then he can make it about offended Brahmin being offended
[20/07/18, 11:28:16 PM] Sush: Ya he probably thinks he‚Äôs pushing your boundaries for you ü§Æ

[20/07/18, 11:29:18 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And I said I hate when male stand up comedians yell with rage to be funny
[20/07/18, 11:29:54 PM] Pranathi Chicago: As though they're not already entitled to displays of anger and rage otherwise
[20/07/18, 11:30:10 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And it's frankly discomfiting to see a man being given a stage and being applauded to yell and scream and rant
[20/07/18, 11:30:31 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Ofc my brother got annoyed and said I shouldn't make generalizations
[20/07/18, 11:30:36 PM] Pranathi Chicago: üëç
[20/07/18, 11:31:04 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Okay I'm just ranting now
[20/07/18, 11:31:06 PM] Pranathi Chicago: How was dinner?!

[21/07/18, 1:03:37 AM] Sush: like can you get thru one set without making masturbation gesture PLIS
[21/07/18, 1:30:52 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Oooh Rodrigo
[21/07/18, 1:30:55 AM] Pranathi Chicago: ;)
[21/07/18, 1:31:29 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah lol men's ostentatious displays of male sexuality are NOT funny. They're scary really
[21/07/18, 1:31:37 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I'm going on date lolol
[21/07/18, 1:31:42 AM] Pranathi Chicago: My arms are so hairy
‚Äé[21/07/18, 1:32:28 AM] Pranathi Chicago: ‚Äéimage omitted
[21/07/18, 1:46:40 AM] Sush: Oooh good luccckkk
[21/07/18, 11:20:07 AM] Sush: How was ittttt
[21/07/18, 11:20:31 AM] Sush: Tell me EVERYTHING!
[21/07/18, 11:32:35 AM] Pranathi Chicago: HIII
[21/07/18, 11:32:47 AM] Pranathi Chicago: It was actually way better than I expected
[21/07/18, 11:32:51 AM] Pranathi Chicago: He seems really put together in life
[21/07/18, 11:33:03 AM] Pranathi Chicago: He fashions himself as a tech dude. Which I can get onboard with mostly
[21/07/18, 11:33:14 AM] Pranathi Chicago: But he seems to have fun. He likes to hike and all
[21/07/18, 11:33:24 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And he plays tabla, so we talked about music for a long while
[21/07/18, 11:33:32 AM] Pranathi Chicago: He also seems really kind and decent and polite
[21/07/18, 11:33:34 AM] Sush: Niiice!
[21/07/18, 11:33:36 AM] Sush: Ayyy
[21/07/18, 11:33:47 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And he's dated, is on online dating apps and all
[21/07/18, 11:34:00 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And it didn't seem like he was saying that was in the past. Like he's still doing all that simultaneously
[21/07/18, 11:34:04 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Which made me feel relieved
[21/07/18, 11:34:15 AM] Sush: That‚Äôs nice! So he‚Äôs also being chill about it
[21/07/18, 11:34:20 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And we were able to talk honestly about this, and that there are like zero expectations
[21/07/18, 11:34:23 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I think we're on the same page
[21/07/18, 11:34:29 AM] Pranathi Chicago: That we're seeing it just as our parents introducing us
[21/07/18, 11:34:30 AM] Sush: How great!!
[21/07/18, 11:34:40 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And we'll keep talking maybe but zero commitment or obligation
[21/07/18, 11:34:40 AM] Sush: Did you feel attractions?
[21/07/18, 11:34:45 AM] Pranathi Chicago: He seemed to be really into me
[21/07/18, 11:34:56 AM] Sush: You are a catch!
[21/07/18, 11:35:16 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I think I like him too but with lots of reservations. I don't know if that's just a natural response after everything and my total lack of trust in men
[21/07/18, 11:35:29 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Or if it's me being overly critical of him
[21/07/18, 11:35:32 AM] Sush: That is v fair
[21/07/18, 11:35:33 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Some things he said I was like hmmm
[21/07/18, 11:35:39 AM] Sush: Where does he live in America?
[21/07/18, 11:35:53 AM] Pranathi Chicago: But I am also trying to not try to overanalyze what he said and form opinions right away
[21/07/18, 11:36:01 AM] Pranathi Chicago: This was literally first meeting and he seemed mostly very lovely
[21/07/18, 11:36:09 AM] Sush: So nice!
[21/07/18, 11:36:15 AM] Pranathi Chicago: He lives in San Diego
[21/07/18, 11:36:19 AM] Sush: I‚Äôm so glad you decided to meet him!!
[21/07/18, 11:36:31 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And haha, thanks ya. ‚ù§ I felt a little validated today!
[21/07/18, 11:36:43 AM] Pranathi Chicago: It was nice feeling like I could be around a guy and not want to sock him in the face
[21/07/18, 11:36:51 AM] Sush: Hahaha!
[21/07/18, 11:37:02 AM] Sush: Correct üòò
[21/07/18, 11:37:21 AM] Pranathi Chicago: :* So we've decided to just keep talking over text and phone at whatever pace feels comfortable
[21/07/18, 11:37:32 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Or not, whenever it feels like one of us isn't interested anymore
[21/07/18, 11:37:36 AM] Sush: Very nice!
[21/07/18, 11:37:39 AM] Pranathi Chicago: But he didn't even know the meaning of ghost
[21/07/18, 11:37:42 AM] Sush: What did parents say
[21/07/18, 11:37:54 AM] Sush: Hahaha
[21/07/18, 11:38:02 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I told him about my experiences with online dating and Nick and all. He also told me some stuff. But he seems to be seedha saadha
[21/07/18, 11:38:02 AM] Sush: Good sign üòÇ
[21/07/18, 11:38:05 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Like no dumb stuff
[21/07/18, 11:38:09 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Like ghosting
[21/07/18, 11:38:15 AM] Sush: Ohh ya that‚Äôs good
[21/07/18, 11:38:26 AM] Pranathi Chicago: My mom asked if everything was okay and it all went fine
[21/07/18, 11:38:29 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I said ya
[21/07/18, 11:38:42 AM] Pranathi Chicago: She seemed mostly relieved because she had guilt that she made me feel trapped or something apparently
[21/07/18, 11:38:48 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I said no no, it was a fun afternoon only
[21/07/18, 11:38:54 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And then she left it
[21/07/18, 11:39:04 AM] Sush: Good good :)
[21/07/18, 11:39:05 AM] Pranathi Chicago: It was fairly miraculous, her level of chill
[21/07/18, 11:39:10 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Dad didn't really talk about it
[21/07/18, 11:39:11 AM] Sush: That‚Äôs amazing
[21/07/18, 11:39:19 AM] Pranathi Chicago: But he'll probably ask my mom and divine thusly
[21/07/18, 11:39:27 AM] Pranathi Chicago: He's too awkward to talk to me about boys
[21/07/18, 11:39:46 AM] Pranathi Chicago: So I am also mostly glad I met him. He seems very chill and down to earth
[21/07/18, 11:39:55 AM] Pranathi Chicago: A little paavam though, which worries me
[21/07/18, 11:40:03 AM] Pranathi Chicago: But it's okay. He doesn't seem judgmental about what I might do
[21/07/18, 11:40:04 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I think!
[21/07/18, 11:40:24 AM] Sush: Yeah as long as he‚Äôs choosing to be paavam!
[21/07/18, 11:40:59 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yes, I think so. I can't figure out his whole moral compass yet
[21/07/18, 11:41:12 AM] Pranathi Chicago: The way he talked about money was like he really enjoys having it
[21/07/18, 11:41:21 AM] Pranathi Chicago: He saved quite a bit of it from when he worked for Microsoft from what I gather
[21/07/18, 11:41:23 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And he likes spending it
[21/07/18, 11:41:37 AM] Sush: Did it sound like nick/Tara?
[21/07/18, 11:41:40 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I don't know how he felt when I told him I'm basically broke and I have no savings
[21/07/18, 11:41:54 AM] Pranathi Chicago: He didn't respond, but I don't think his silence meant he was judging me
[21/07/18, 11:42:13 AM] Pranathi Chicago: He could've been, but I can't say it was definitely dhuddu aasai like them. Maybe he was just quiet out of respect also
[21/07/18, 11:42:21 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Like what to say when someone says they're broke?
[21/07/18, 11:42:25 AM] Sush: True
[21/07/18, 11:42:36 AM] Sush: ‚Äòdon‚Äôt worry‚Äô is condescending
[21/07/18, 11:42:50 AM] Pranathi Chicago: He doesn't read fiction!
[21/07/18, 11:42:52 AM] Sush: There is really no correct response
[21/07/18, 11:42:52 AM] Pranathi Chicago: That also bothers me
[21/07/18, 11:43:01 AM] Pranathi Chicago: But I can't control someone's hobbies
[21/07/18, 11:43:07 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And he seems fairly aware of the world at large
[21/07/18, 11:43:10 AM] Sush: Haha üòÇ
[21/07/18, 11:43:14 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I just don't know if he has that creative impulse
[21/07/18, 11:43:26 AM] Sush: yaaa I‚Äôm also mildly skeptical when people don‚Äôt fiction
[21/07/18, 11:43:38 AM] Sush: Does he like tv cinema etc tho?
[21/07/18, 11:43:57 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah. We didn't get around to talking about it although he mentioned in his email that he does TV movies etc.
[21/07/18, 11:44:03 AM] Pranathi Chicago: We talked a lot a lot a lot
[21/07/18, 11:44:09 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I liked that conversation barely flagged and time flew by
[21/07/18, 11:44:13 AM] Sush: Very good!!
[21/07/18, 11:44:17 AM] Pranathi Chicago: We spoke from 12 to 4:30 without stopping almost
[21/07/18, 11:44:22 AM] Sush: Lovely!
[21/07/18, 11:44:27 AM] Sush: So many boys can‚Äôt do that
[21/07/18, 11:44:42 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I know. It was just a relief to not sit there goading him and prodding him into answering questions
[21/07/18, 11:44:45 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Just to have something to do there
[21/07/18, 11:45:00 AM] Sush: I can imagine!!
[21/07/18, 11:45:02 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I like his sister a lot!
[21/07/18, 11:45:08 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I don't even know her but she seems super similar to me
[21/07/18, 11:45:17 AM] Sush: Northwestern girl?
[21/07/18, 11:45:21 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Even he was slightly taken aback by how similar we seemed apparently
[21/07/18, 11:45:25 AM] Sush: He should visit her lol
[21/07/18, 11:45:26 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah Sociology girl at Northwestern
[21/07/18, 11:45:35 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And she got hired at Carleton as assistant prof just now
[21/07/18, 11:45:46 AM] Pranathi Chicago: She's defending this winter
[21/07/18, 11:45:55 AM] Sush: How fancy!
[21/07/18, 11:46:05 AM] Sush: For some reason I assumed she was undergrad
[21/07/18, 11:46:09 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah haha. He also told me to visit if things pick up etc. He said San Diego is really chill and he'd be happy to host me
[21/07/18, 11:46:15 AM] Pranathi Chicago: No she's older than him
[21/07/18, 11:46:19 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Akka
[21/07/18, 11:46:24 AM] Sush: Nice!
[21/07/18, 11:46:39 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I would like to visit San Diego and get free acco
[21/07/18, 11:46:41 AM] Pranathi Chicago: But we'll see lol
[21/07/18, 11:46:49 AM] Pranathi Chicago: He's endlessly on probation
[21/07/18, 11:46:57 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I expect him to do something to shoot himself in the foot
[21/07/18, 11:46:59 AM] Sush: Correct üòÇ
[21/07/18, 11:47:08 AM] Sush: Can‚Äôt hurt to be wary
[21/07/18, 11:47:25 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah I told him I would be
[21/07/18, 11:47:28 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Lol
[21/07/18, 11:47:40 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I was upfront about everything when he asked.
[21/07/18, 11:47:59 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Which was nice for me because I didn't feel the need to skirt around some of the stuff I would normally on a first date
[21/07/18, 11:48:13 AM] Pranathi Chicago: He felt easy to talk to. Although I noticed he doesn't curse at all
[21/07/18, 11:48:25 AM] Pranathi Chicago: His eyes widened every time I said fuck. Which wasn't that many times as a result
[21/07/18, 11:48:44 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I have to go talk to my grandmother for just a bit. I will brb. :*
[21/07/18, 11:49:07 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Tell me about your evening and what you cooked and dinner and everything pls! I will respond shortly ‚ù§
[21/07/18, 11:51:19 AM] Sush: üòÇüòÇ
[21/07/18, 2:18:09 PM] Sush: how is your grandmother??
[21/07/18, 2:18:32 PM] Sush: dinner was nice! I made chole and palak paneer and jeera rice and heated up tortillas with ghee
[21/07/18, 2:18:39 PM] Sush: ben brought cake
[21/07/18, 2:18:45 PM] Sush: everyone loved the food
[21/07/18, 2:19:04 PM] Sush: rodrigo couldn't make it because of some football game but then he came later at night and ate :P
[21/07/18, 9:00:40 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Hi just woke up!
[21/07/18, 9:00:46 PM] Pranathi Chicago: She's gooooood
[21/07/18, 9:01:02 PM] Pranathi Chicago: She gave me chutney podi and vangi bath podi!
[21/07/18, 9:01:29 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yummmm I still haven't tried your palak paneer I think!
[21/07/18, 9:02:02 PM] Pranathi Chicago: That sounds like a very fun time. :)
[21/07/18, 9:02:31 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Did Rodrigo ask for poori again? :P
[21/07/18, 9:03:09 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I wish I was there for Pitchfork!
[21/07/18, 9:03:21 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I see pictures and it looks like fun
[21/07/18, 9:56:31 PM] Sush: Yaaay!
[21/07/18, 9:56:45 PM] Sush: I just went to doc films with Anshuman and Danielle
[21/07/18, 9:56:55 PM] Sush: I think I can‚Äôt hang out with him without her üòÖ
[21/07/18, 9:57:06 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Hahaha
[21/07/18, 9:57:13 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Too boring?
[21/07/18, 9:57:23 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Which movie?
[21/07/18, 9:58:23 PM] Sush: It‚Äôs just awkward I think
[21/07/18, 9:58:28 PM] Sush: And she is so much more fun lol
[21/07/18, 9:58:37 PM] Sush: Nayak
[21/07/18, 9:58:43 PM] Sush: Satyajit Ray
[21/07/18, 9:58:49 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Hahaha faaaair
[21/07/18, 9:58:54 PM] Sush: I was only able to read like 2 words in Bangla üò¢
[21/07/18, 9:59:07 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Women are so much more interesting
[21/07/18, 9:59:21 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I wish we were attracted to them
[21/07/18, 9:59:37 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Ooh yeah I saw it was playing
[21/07/18, 10:00:00 PM] Sush: I know lol
[21/07/18, 10:00:07 PM] Pranathi Chicago: You learned in Calcutta now?
[21/07/18, 10:00:11 PM] Pranathi Chicago: *no?
[21/07/18, 10:00:19 PM] Sush: Ya I learned for a little over a year
[21/07/18, 10:00:23 PM] Pranathi Chicago: It's so hard to remember languages you learned as a kid!
[21/07/18, 10:00:27 PM] Sush: Third language
[21/07/18, 10:00:35 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I learned Spanish for a year as a kid and barely remember anything
[21/07/18, 10:00:44 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Unless you practice at home ofc
[21/07/18, 10:00:47 PM] Sush: Ya it‚Äôs hard to remember unless you‚Äôre in touch
[21/07/18, 10:00:50 PM] Sush: Correct
[21/07/18, 10:00:57 PM] Sush: Maybe I should learn Bangla again
[21/07/18, 10:01:03 PM] Sush: Or just learn to read Tamil!
[21/07/18, 10:01:06 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Hey you remember I was raving about Jonathan Gold?
[21/07/18, 10:01:11 PM] Pranathi Chicago: One food writer?
[21/07/18, 10:01:16 PM] Pranathi Chicago: He died :(
[21/07/18, 10:01:29 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And yeah I also want to learn Tamil formally!
[21/07/18, 10:02:21 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I think it's a pity I was in Chennai for so long and I didn't learn Tamil at school
[21/07/18, 10:02:29 PM] Sush: Ohh :(
[21/07/18, 10:02:33 PM] Sush: Paapa was he old?
[21/07/18, 10:02:41 PM] Pranathi Chicago: No he was 57
[21/07/18, 10:02:42 PM] Sush: We‚Äôll learn together if I stay in Chicago!
[21/07/18, 10:02:49 PM] Sush: Oh man how did he die!
[21/07/18, 10:02:52 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yesss that would be so nice
[21/07/18, 10:02:55 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Pancreatic cancer
[21/07/18, 10:02:59 PM] Sush: Paapa!
[21/07/18, 10:03:12 PM] Pranathi Chicago: No? I feel so sorry. I felt like he spoke to my soul
[21/07/18, 10:03:24 PM] Pranathi Chicago: So intense, but true! His writing was so beautiful
[21/07/18, 10:04:05 PM] Sush: I will google him
‚Äé[21/07/18, 10:05:13 PM] Pranathi Chicago: ‚Äéimage omitted
[21/07/18, 10:05:25 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Sorry I'm going on about this :P
[21/07/18, 10:05:39 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I just got my period today and I am feeling heavily hormonal
[21/07/18, 10:05:41 PM] Sush: So evocative!
[21/07/18, 10:06:07 PM] Pranathi Chicago: No? Especially as a vegetarian, it creates a whole rich world of images and sensations
[21/07/18, 10:06:21 PM] Sush: Yeah!
[21/07/18, 10:06:31 PM] Sush: I‚Äôve never really been into food writing tho
[21/07/18, 10:06:53 PM] Sush: Maybe I haven‚Äôt read the right writing
[21/07/18, 10:07:08 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah and it's also a funny medium
[21/07/18, 10:07:20 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Food is something you taste and smell and see
[21/07/18, 10:07:35 PM] Pranathi Chicago: So it's a hard thing to do, to translate that into writing
[21/07/18, 10:07:39 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Hard to do it well anyway
[21/07/18, 10:07:42 PM] Sush: True!
[21/07/18, 10:07:58 PM] Sush: I like food writing when it‚Äôs about a person I guess
[21/07/18, 10:08:17 PM] Sush: Like a person‚Äôs relationship with food is such a personal window into who they are
[21/07/18, 10:08:49 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Makes sense!
[21/07/18, 10:08:56 PM] Pranathi Chicago: It's such a primal connection
[21/07/18, 10:09:01 PM] Pranathi Chicago: What you're doing!
[21/07/18, 10:15:35 PM] Sush: I‚Äôm doing little bit work
[21/07/18, 10:15:42 PM] Sush: Then will go for walk with Rodrigo
[21/07/18, 10:16:21 PM] Pranathi Chicago: So cute!
[21/07/18, 10:16:30 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Have a nice walk ‚ù§
[21/07/18, 10:39:06 PM] Sush: what are you doing with your grandmommmm
[21/07/18, 11:19:45 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Not much! I'm actually trying to work
[21/07/18, 11:19:50 PM] Pranathi Chicago: But it's so frustrating
[21/07/18, 11:20:00 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Marco just emailed me saying he needs all the maps in crazy high res
[21/07/18, 11:20:17 PM] Pranathi Chicago: But my map projects are on the desktop of a lab computer on campus
[21/07/18, 11:20:24 PM] Pranathi Chicago: So I have to wait till I get back
[21/07/18, 11:20:48 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Except he's being really impatient. Which I also think is slightly unfair since he didn't tell me this stuff, and he told me I'm done with maps stuff, so I didn't bring that work with me
[21/07/18, 11:21:15 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Plus I could've worked on it if I'd saved it to the cloud as I thought I had, but I think that upload failed. Each of these project files is maaaasssive
[21/07/18, 11:21:34 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Sorry all random ranting basically, but I'm just stressing about work and about coming back and having to take care of myself again lol
[22/07/18, 12:32:01 AM] Sush: ayyo that's annoying!
[22/07/18, 12:32:14 AM] Sush: let me know if it's anything i can go and  upload for you?
[22/07/18, 12:32:58 AM] Pranathi Chicago: It will be very stressful to find someone to let you in and to find the folder and all I think. :( But it's okay. I think he has to make peace with the fact that he asked me too last minute so it can't happen before I com eback
[22/07/18, 12:33:07 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I really appreciate you offering though ‚ù§ That is so very kind!
[22/07/18, 12:33:29 AM] Sush: Let me know if you need me to anyway tho ‚ù§
[22/07/18, 12:33:28 AM] Pranathi Chicago: If it was not summer, I could've asked Austin but everyone's away now
[22/07/18, 12:33:38 AM] Sush: ohh

[22/07/18, 12:35:28 AM] Sush: maybe they clean / change on sundays or something
[22/07/18, 12:35:40 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Ohh makes sense. So annoying though!
[22/07/18, 12:35:42 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I wish we could go to the lake late at night
[22/07/18, 12:35:44 AM] Pranathi Chicago: It would be so nice

[22/07/18, 12:37:46 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I feel like I could see him as that little boy
[22/07/18, 12:37:52 AM] Sush: hahaahaha!
[22/07/18, 12:37:55 AM] Sush: yeah! he does!
[22/07/18, 12:38:03 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Like when he was a kutti payyan

[22/07/18, 12:43:08 AM] Sush: what they'll do in pilsen festival?
[22/07/18, 12:43:27 AM] Sush: i'm very confused by these festivals

[22/07/18, 12:44:16 AM] Sush: like, i never know what to do :P
[22/07/18, 12:44:37 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Lolol
[22/07/18, 12:44:51 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I think it's just to go there and eat food and yell to friends over the loud music
[22/07/18, 12:44:59 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And pay for things that you think you need but definitely don't
[22/07/18, 12:45:05 AM] Sush: üòÇ
[22/07/18, 12:45:11 AM] Pranathi Chicago: In other words, it's a chance for them to make revenue off of you
[22/07/18, 12:45:18 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Convincing you into thinking you're having fun
[22/07/18, 12:45:19 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Lol

[22/07/18, 12:54:26 AM] Sush: he's a bit of a pyromaniac!
[22/07/18, 12:56:59 AM] Pranathi Chicago: So lovely! This is the naughty uncle your mom was talking about no?
[22/07/18, 12:57:20 AM] Sush: that's her cousin :P
[22/07/18, 12:57:24 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I am feeling very indignant about my house right now. My mom still follows the old don't come into kitchen or puja room rule when I'm on my period
[22/07/18, 12:57:24 AM] Sush: this is her younger brother
[22/07/18, 12:57:30 AM] Sush: but he's as bad
[22/07/18, 12:57:31 AM] Pranathi Chicago: She says she doesn't care but it's because of the koil

[22/07/18, 12:58:00 AM] Sush: how will 'people' even know
[22/07/18, 12:58:15 AM] Pranathi Chicago: We had a fight about it last time when I tried to engage. She said it's not personal but she can't make exceptions for me because it's unfair
[22/07/18, 12:58:33 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Lol unfair it seems
[22/07/18, 12:58:35 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I hate it so much
[22/07/18, 12:58:41 AM] Sush: that's nuts it's literally your house
[22/07/18, 12:58:58 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah. It makes me feel really upset at her
[22/07/18, 12:59:01 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And resentful
[22/07/18, 12:59:08 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Like how could she do that to her own daughter
[22/07/18, 1:00:12 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Anyway. I leave in less than 10 days so it's okay I guess
[22/07/18, 1:00:58 AM] Sush: it's so hard to shake these things up!
[22/07/18, 1:01:26 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I'm writing about it because I don't know how else to let go of the rage I'm feeling about it
[22/07/18, 1:01:51 AM] Sush: fair :(
[22/07/18, 1:02:12 AM] Sush: 'Adulthood is completely understanding why Britney Spears shaved her head'

[22/07/18, 1:11:41 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Actually never mind haha it is just whining anyway

[22/07/18, 1:39:55 AM] Sush: slightly but not getting sleep lol
[22/07/18, 1:40:01 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I am so resentful of people who shift around interviews or cancel
[22/07/18, 1:40:20 AM] Pranathi Chicago: It just seems so rude but I know I'm in the position of begging so can't throw around attitude
[22/07/18, 1:40:33 AM] Sush: true, you're kinda at their mercy :(
[22/07/18, 1:40:45 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Even I was struggling to go to sleep last night
[22/07/18, 1:40:49 AM] Pranathi Chicago: It's gotten soooo hot here
[22/07/18, 1:41:11 AM] Pranathi Chicago: You sleep in the living room with AC? Or in bedroom?

[22/07/18, 1:45:24 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Is it very hot when you go to water the plants?
[22/07/18, 1:46:47 AM] Sush: Not really!
[22/07/18, 1:47:13 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah it's protected from direct sunlight so it's mostly okay unless the temp gets hot

[22/07/18, 10:44:28 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I'm super struck by how there's a recognition of caste by Carnatic musicians usually, but they don't want to call it that. They call it "culture" or "occupation"

[22/07/18, 10:50:15 AM] Sush: Nice!

[22/07/18, 10:50:37 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I can imagine! I remember that happened to Nick last summer
[22/07/18, 10:50:45 AM] Sush: It‚Äôs SO RUDE
[22/07/18, 10:50:45 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And he paid to use it over the summer

[22/07/18, 10:51:39 AM] Sush: Ugh so rude!

[22/07/18, 12:58:58 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Means?
[22/07/18, 12:58:59 PM] Sush: she wants to go to business school it seems
[22/07/18, 12:59:05 PM] Sush: like all of a sudden
[22/07/18, 12:59:19 PM] Sush: because she is surrounded by people making $$
[22/07/18, 12:59:33 PM] Sush: i'm like i'm fucking unemployed till sept can we not
[22/07/18, 12:59:40 PM] Sush: and we spent like 2 HOURS talking about it
[22/07/18, 12:59:53 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Omg that sounds awful. :/
[22/07/18, 1:00:08 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Do they not realize that you'd feel awful listening to them?
[22/07/18, 1:00:14 PM] Pranathi Chicago: That sounds very entitled and selfish
[22/07/18, 1:00:20 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Sorry if that's out of line but it is
[22/07/18, 1:00:26 PM] Sush: they keep saying i don't actually have to worry
[22/07/18, 1:00:41 PM] Sush: because there is no diff between their profiles and mine and it's just a matter of time
[22/07/18, 1:01:04 PM] Sush: haylee was like i have ZERO concern for you because i'm 100% sure you'll land something you like
[22/07/18, 1:01:08 PM] Pranathi Chicago: That's condescending though. Because whatever the case, you are worrying right now and that is valid
[22/07/18, 1:01:20 PM] Sush: but for nina it's like she doesn't have 'money-making skillset' or something
[22/07/18, 1:01:25 PM] Sush: idk
[22/07/18, 1:01:26 PM] Pranathi Chicago: You don't have to brush your anxieties aside because they'd rather not hear it
[22/07/18, 1:01:45 PM] Sush: yeah - they're very good at building me up when i'm anxious
[22/07/18, 1:01:52 PM] Sush: but nina's anxiety was triggering for me
[22/07/18, 1:02:14 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Or maybe they do, I don't know if I'm speaking with very little knowledge of them or what happened. But I can imagine that it was stressful to hear them go on about it
[22/07/18, 1:02:23 PM] Sush: it was v stressful!
[22/07/18, 1:02:35 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Like, now is not the time Nina
[22/07/18, 1:02:41 PM] Sush: and nina's being kinda silly about it also
[22/07/18, 1:02:58 PM] Pranathi Chicago: She's just sad that everyone else is getting jobs or something?
[22/07/18, 1:03:10 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Isn't she getting $$ too?
[22/07/18, 1:03:21 PM] Sush: no, she works as a research analyst or something at booth
[22/07/18, 1:03:33 PM] Sush: and she has a history masters
[22/07/18, 1:03:42 PM] Sush: she makes ~ $50k
[22/07/18, 1:03:49 PM] Sush: which isn't bad at all!
[22/07/18, 1:03:59 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah!! I'd love that kind Do money
[22/07/18, 1:04:03 PM] Pranathi Chicago: *of
[22/07/18, 1:04:11 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And it's good for a first job out of school
[22/07/18, 1:04:17 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Especially with a history masters
[22/07/18, 1:04:26 PM] Sush: she's comparing with haylee and chelsea which is silly
[22/07/18, 1:04:37 PM] Sush: it's a whole other industry
[22/07/18, 1:04:38 PM] Sush: ALSo
[22/07/18, 1:04:42 PM] Sush: i discovered something
[22/07/18, 1:04:49 PM] Pranathi Chicago: What??
[22/07/18, 1:04:54 PM] Sush: they all intend to have babies and stop working for like YEARS
[22/07/18, 1:05:59 PM] Sush: no judgement but it's interesting that that seems to be a given
[22/07/18, 1:06:16 PM] Pranathi Chicago: So interextingggg
[22/07/18, 1:06:25 PM] Pranathi Chicago: How did that come up?
[22/07/18, 1:06:35 PM] Sush: we were talking about long term plans
[22/07/18, 1:06:45 PM] Sush: and they kinda plan their careers for the next 5 years
[22/07/18, 1:06:47 PM] Sush: 'until babies'
[22/07/18, 1:08:53 PM] Pranathi Chicago: So interesting
[22/07/18, 1:08:58 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Did they ask about your plans?
[22/07/18, 1:09:11 PM] Pranathi Chicago: That's kind of stressful in its own way
[22/07/18, 1:09:19 PM] Sush: ya they were asking about how my parents managed to make a 2-working-parents family work
[22/07/18, 1:09:25 PM] Sush: which was so interesting to me
[22/07/18, 1:09:43 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Paavam this whole conversation sounds so intense!
[22/07/18, 1:09:49 PM] Sush: it was lol
[22/07/18, 1:09:55 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Like everybody take a break and drink some hot chocolate lol
[22/07/18, 1:10:03 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Oh they're not used to that?
[22/07/18, 1:10:23 PM] Sush: ya it was! nina paavam was also being so vulnerable but it was stressful for me lol
[22/07/18, 1:10:26 PM] Sush: ya they're not!
[22/07/18, 1:10:42 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Lol. I feel like there should be some heads up
[22/07/18, 1:10:48 PM] Sush: trigger warning
[22/07/18, 1:10:51 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Like hey, this is going to happen, trigger warning
[22/07/18, 1:10:54 PM] Sush: ya!
[22/07/18, 1:10:57 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Jinx
[22/07/18, 1:10:58 PM] Sush: she was in tears also
[22/07/18, 1:11:02 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Aww
[22/07/18, 1:11:02 PM] Sush: i felt bad to be like HUSH
[22/07/18, 1:11:09 PM] Pranathi Chicago: That's fair
[22/07/18, 1:11:34 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I think I would feel insecure if everyone around me was like minting money too, but also I know what I've gotten myself into
[22/07/18, 1:11:47 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Like sociology is not for making money, and history is definitely not
[22/07/18, 1:12:12 PM] Sush: ya....similarly for H&C, no point comparing with engineers / finance junta
[22/07/18, 1:12:14 PM] Pranathi Chicago: But it's hard to reconcile that I guess with the reality of earning less than friends if money matters that much
[22/07/18, 1:12:35 PM] Pranathi Chicago: What's H&C again?
[22/07/18, 1:12:42 PM] Sush: haylee and chelsea hahaha sorry
[22/07/18, 1:12:54 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Oh lolol I thought it was some type of job
[22/07/18, 1:13:00 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I was very confused
[22/07/18, 1:13:01 PM] Sush: sometimes i'm also like i'm _never_ going to make nearly as much money as vinay or pojo
[22/07/18, 1:13:25 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah probably true. But that's not the benchmark anyway
[22/07/18, 1:13:44 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And you're probably going to come damn close to it
[22/07/18, 1:13:58 PM] Sush: nah - they'll be making like 2x what i make easily
[22/07/18, 1:14:03 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Considering insti, I don't think I'd have expected any of us to make even regular money
[22/07/18, 1:14:12 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Let alone better than decent money
[22/07/18, 1:14:26 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Oh yeah, I have no conception of what they'd make tbh haha
[22/07/18, 1:15:01 PM] Sush: dude they were talking about how 100k+ jobs were a compromise for more leisure as opposed to 200k+ jobs where they'd be working all the time :P
[22/07/18, 1:15:15 PM] Pranathi Chicago: :/
[22/07/18, 1:15:18 PM] Pranathi Chicago: :///////
[22/07/18, 1:15:24 PM] Sush: they were talking of like a 5 year horizon
[22/07/18, 1:15:28 PM] Sush: not right out of school
[22/07/18, 1:15:31 PM] Sush: but still :P
[22/07/18, 1:15:36 PM] Sush: i'll _never_ make that much lol
[22/07/18, 1:15:56 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I am here wondering whether to retweet this conference hashtag because that is the chunda semblance of pride this dumb academia offers me
[22/07/18, 1:16:01 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And that is LAAAAAME
[22/07/18, 1:16:10 PM] Sush: PLEASE DO
[22/07/18, 1:16:21 PM] Sush: i will retweet so proudly
[22/07/18, 1:16:40 PM] Pranathi Chicago: no I mean like money is not even a consideration and these people are talking about 100k like it is some petty cash
[22/07/18, 1:16:43 PM] Pranathi Chicago: So funny haha
[22/07/18, 1:16:48 PM] Sush: ya no?!
[22/07/18, 1:16:55 PM] Pranathi Chicago: But yesss I just did like one braggy dummy
[22/07/18, 1:16:59 PM] Pranathi Chicago: üôà
[22/07/18, 1:17:02 PM] Sush: if i _ever_ get 100k i'll be like ü§ëü§ëü§ëü§ë
[22/07/18, 1:17:16 PM] Sush: üí∞üí∏üí∏üí≤
[22/07/18, 1:17:19 PM] Pranathi Chicago: If I get 100k I'm booking Europe trip the minute I do
[22/07/18, 1:17:29 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Spain here I come
[22/07/18, 1:17:35 PM] Sush: yes indeeeeeed
[22/07/18, 1:17:37 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Lolol so funny people with money are
[22/07/18, 1:17:42 PM] Sush: i'll get laser treatment done
[22/07/18, 1:17:46 PM] Sush: i'm so lame -_-
[22/07/18, 1:18:09 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Even this Shravan was telling me he doesn't think about spending money because he has so much of it
[22/07/18, 1:18:20 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I don't think that was braggy
[22/07/18, 1:18:28 PM] Pranathi Chicago: But it was the natural ease of the well cushioned
[22/07/18, 1:18:32 PM] Pranathi Chicago: If that makes sense
[22/07/18, 1:18:37 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Haha nooo that's also fair
[22/07/18, 1:18:37 PM] Sush: yeah that makes sense
[22/07/18, 1:18:49 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I should want to get my acne scars removed
[22/07/18, 1:18:54 PM] Sush: my desires are also so lame lol
[22/07/18, 1:18:59 PM] Pranathi Chicago: But I've kind of accepted that they're part of my face now
[22/07/18, 1:19:08 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Just because I can't actually do anything about them
[22/07/18, 1:19:17 PM] Sush: laser treatment will help my nasty bumps apparently
[22/07/18, 1:19:31 PM] Pranathi Chicago: The ingrown hair sitch?
[22/07/18, 1:19:35 PM] Sush: so it might spare me a good bit of pain
[22/07/18, 1:19:36 PM] Sush: ya!
[22/07/18, 1:19:38 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I saw some ad for something called fur
[22/07/18, 1:19:42 PM] Sush: fur oil!
[22/07/18, 1:19:50 PM] Sush: ya i've seen
[22/07/18, 1:19:53 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Which is some oil to prevent ingrown hairs or something
[22/07/18, 1:20:01 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I don't know how well it works tho
[22/07/18, 1:20:13 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I saw this damn scary article about birth contro
[22/07/18, 1:20:17 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Control
[22/07/18, 1:20:32 PM] Pranathi Chicago: This digital thing that actually got so many women pregnant
[22/07/18, 1:20:35 PM] Pranathi Chicago: False claim birth control
[22/07/18, 1:21:16 PM] Sush: wtfff
[22/07/18, 3:00:27 PM] Sush: dude
[22/07/18, 3:00:32 PM] Sush: my apartment continues to plague me
[22/07/18, 3:00:34 PM] Sush: the old one
[22/07/18, 9:27:16 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Hi just woke up!
[22/07/18, 9:35:59 PM] Pranathi Chicago: What happened?
[22/07/18, 11:35:22 PM] Sush: i think i'm sad haylee is going away also!
[22/07/18, 11:35:31 PM] Sush: and like, it's the end of an era of sorts
[22/07/18, 11:35:42 PM] Sush: which ALSO triggers the fact that idk what MY next era is
[22/07/18, 11:41:31 PM] Sush: like i know it'll be fine
[22/07/18, 11:41:45 PM] Sush: and i'm trying not be like it's not FAIR that idk yet why can't i just have a fun holiday
[22/07/18, 11:41:54 PM] Sush: because that's spoiled and entitled
[22/07/18, 11:42:00 PM] Sush: and not constructive
[22/07/18, 11:46:33 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah, all those feelings are totally valid and I would be as upset if I were in the same place!
[22/07/18, 11:47:01 PM] Pranathi Chicago: It's not fair that it's so hard right now, and I don't think it's totally off base to feel that way
[22/07/18, 11:47:11 PM] Pranathi Chicago: But you're right in saying that it probably won't make you feel any better
[22/07/18, 11:47:23 PM] Sush: i'm starting to have like deja vu feeling like i never get anything without some despair first
[22/07/18, 11:47:36 PM] Sush: i'm being so inarticulate first
[22/07/18, 11:47:46 PM] Pranathi Chicago: It's okay, you don't need to be articulate and all
[22/07/18, 11:48:02 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Anger and frustration are totally legit feelings and I know they can rob you of your words
[22/07/18, 11:48:27 PM] Sush: that boy was really so irritating
[22/07/18, 11:48:31 PM] Sush: what are your DREAMS it seems
[22/07/18, 11:48:32 PM] Sush: eff you
[22/07/18, 11:48:36 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah, that must have been so triggering
[22/07/18, 11:48:40 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Dreams is such a safed way of thinking
[22/07/18, 11:48:48 PM] Sush: how dare you think you can be privy to my dreams you rando
[22/07/18, 11:50:00 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah. I think that's so entitled
[22/07/18, 11:50:11 PM] Pranathi Chicago: To think we all do things because we're trying to chase some dumb fucking dream
[22/07/18, 11:50:27 PM] Sush: and like why is that casual conversation lol
[22/07/18, 11:50:32 PM] Sush: whatever happened to books and movies
[22/07/18, 11:50:53 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah lol. It seems like that's all very intense topics only
[22/07/18, 11:51:04 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Just little bit chill and smoke a J or something people

[22/07/18, 11:55:35 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Maybe it'll help with the anxiety over the job stuff
[22/07/18, 11:55:46 PM] Sush: not really :/

[23/07/18, 11:30:21 PM] Pranathi Chicago: It's just annoying because he's been very vague about all this
[23/07/18, 11:30:34 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And now suddenly he's freaking about his deadline and realizes he didn't ask about map specifications before

[23/07/18, 11:35:40 PM] Pranathi Chicago: She's fine. I think we bore each other a little bit unless we're talking about food.
[23/07/18, 11:35:48 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I mean there's only so much we have to say to each other
[23/07/18, 11:35:56 PM] Sush: omg my Paati‚Äôs sister makes her grand kids call her ‚Äògrandma‚Äô instead of Paati
[23/07/18, 11:35:59 PM] Sush: Fair!

[23/07/18, 11:36:42 PM] Sush: Lolol no!
[23/07/18, 11:36:48 PM] Pranathi Chicago: We were talking about soaps our paatis watch and she says, "My grandmom watches the Bold and the Beautiful."
[23/07/18, 11:36:52 PM] Sush: But my sister and  I used to watch
[23/07/18, 11:36:53 PM] Sush: Hahahaha

[23/07/18, 11:52:14 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Fusion stuff basically
[23/07/18, 11:52:26 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I'm supposed to meet with a gaana singer but he's not really responding to texts
[23/07/18, 11:52:45 PM] Pranathi Chicago: HAHA hilarious tweet
[23/07/18, 11:53:09 PM] Sush: Ooh nice!

[23/07/18, 11:55:10 PM] Sush: So I preemptively texted him being like don‚Äôt worry
[23/07/18, 11:55:20 PM] Sush: He was like wtf when did I say I‚Äôm worried
[23/07/18, 11:55:33 PM] Sush: Which is relieving to hear
[23/07/18, 11:55:44 PM] Sush: What did he say re: caste?
[23/07/18, 11:56:59 PM] Pranathi Chicago: So nice that your dad is being chill about it!
[23/07/18, 11:57:04 PM] Pranathi Chicago: It must be such a relief no?
[23/07/18, 11:57:08 PM] Sush: Ya it isss
[23/07/18, 11:57:11 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Haven't spoken to the guy yet

[23/07/18, 11:57:38 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Lol yes
[23/07/18, 11:57:52 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I am feeling so lethargic
[23/07/18, 11:57:56 PM] Pranathi Chicago: This heat doesn't help
[23/07/18, 11:58:03 PM] Sush: I can imagine üò≠
[23/07/18, 11:58:15 PM] Sush: Plus Home is also such a borrowing time
[24/07/18, 12:01:10 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeahhh.
[24/07/18, 12:01:27 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I'm really ready to just have my own apartment back and start working
[24/07/18, 12:01:36 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I'm finding it soooo hard to work here
[24/07/18, 12:01:50 AM] Sush: Yaaa people interrupt so much also üòÖ
[24/07/18, 12:01:59 AM] Sush: and no quiet space
[24/07/18, 12:03:22 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah exactly
[24/07/18, 12:03:35 AM] Pranathi Chicago: My grandmother keeps barging in and she starts talking even if I'm doing something else
[24/07/18, 12:03:41 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And there's no way to get her to stop
[24/07/18, 12:49:31 AM] Sush: It‚Äôll be too much to postpone work till you return no? :(
[24/07/18, 1:06:55 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah. :( I have too many deadlines coming up
[24/07/18, 1:07:10 AM] Pranathi Chicago: This Nick thing from last year is really triggering me about coming back
[24/07/18, 1:07:15 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I know rationally it's not the same
[24/07/18, 1:07:24 AM] Pranathi Chicago: But I feel so much more depleted than I did a year ago
[24/07/18, 1:07:26 AM] Sush: I can understand :(
[24/07/18, 1:07:44 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Just exhausted and cynical and sad and betrayed still
[24/07/18, 1:07:48 AM] Sush: The last time must have been so traumatising
[24/07/18, 1:07:54 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Which I thought would go away after a year
[24/07/18, 1:08:06 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah, the dread at leaving and returning
[24/07/18, 1:08:19 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Felt very much like I was stuck in the cracks of movement
[24/07/18, 1:08:26 AM] Sush: It doesn‚Äôt get easier :/
[24/07/18, 1:08:59 AM] Pranathi Chicago: He keeps coming in my dreams after elaborate set ups where we finally meet. It feels like we're about to talk about what happened and then I wake up
[24/07/18, 1:09:06 AM] Sush: There‚Äôs a lot to look forward to? New project is going nicely, there‚Äôs no huge trauma to deal with upon your return
[24/07/18, 1:09:12 AM] Sush: Oh man :(
[24/07/18, 1:09:20 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah true. I think there's just a sense of lack of closure somehow
[24/07/18, 1:09:32 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Maybe you never really get it
[24/07/18, 1:09:35 AM] Sush: I can completely understand how triggering your impending return must be
[24/07/18, 1:09:53 AM] Sush: Probably not :/ at least until you fall in love again
[24/07/18, 1:10:02 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Thank you for understanding. It also makes me sad that my mom is being so fucking unreasonable with this period stuff
[24/07/18, 1:10:07 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Like she's gone berserk
[24/07/18, 1:10:23 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And it really sucks. I hate that she would be so stubborn about this one thing of all things
[24/07/18, 1:10:52 AM] Pranathi Chicago: She's been passive aggressively sending me blogs of women who say the kitchen being off limits thing is based on some pseudo Ayurveda crap
[24/07/18, 1:11:00 AM] Sush: Oh man why is she digging her heels in for this :/
[24/07/18, 1:11:11 AM] Sush: Abbas this internet pseudo science
[24/07/18, 1:11:16 AM] Sush: *abbah
[24/07/18, 1:11:57 AM] Sush: My dad‚Äôs SURGEON friend sent him a video about how drink gaumutra once a week is great for health
[24/07/18, 1:12:28 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I think she's being petulant because she doesn't see me resisting anything else this vehemently
[24/07/18, 1:12:43 AM] Pranathi Chicago: For the most part I've just been nodding along
[24/07/18, 1:12:56 AM] Sush: What does your dad say?
[24/07/18, 1:12:58 AM] Pranathi Chicago: This one thing she thinks is because of my radical sociology training lol
[24/07/18, 1:13:02 AM] Sush: ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
[24/07/18, 1:13:05 AM] Pranathi Chicago: My dad hasn't said a word to me
[24/07/18, 1:13:31 AM] Pranathi Chicago: But he's silently giving my mom his support while indicating to my BROTHER that he thinks it's stupid
[24/07/18, 1:13:43 AM] Sush: Ugh I hate that
[24/07/18, 1:13:50 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I talked to my brother and for once he's being fully onboard
[24/07/18, 1:14:02 AM] Sush: Oh good
[24/07/18, 1:14:02 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I told him he needs to stand up for me if he cares enough
[24/07/18, 1:14:12 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Like that's he least he could do because it doesn't affect him AT AL
[24/07/18, 1:14:14 AM] Pranathi Chicago: AL
[24/07/18, 1:14:17 AM] Pranathi Chicago: ALL
[24/07/18, 1:14:19 AM] Sush: True
[24/07/18, 1:14:19 AM] Pranathi Chicago: lol
[24/07/18, 1:14:25 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Which he did to his credit
[24/07/18, 1:14:35 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And got yelled at apparently
[24/07/18, 1:14:47 AM] Sush: Lol it‚Äôs ok he can get yelled at
[24/07/18, 1:14:59 AM] Sush: Part of the negotiation
[24/07/18, 1:14:59 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Anyway it's all messed up and my mom is being militant about this and I'm trying hard not to resent her
[24/07/18, 1:15:08 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah I don't really think he minded
[24/07/18, 1:15:21 AM] Sush: Good that he‚Äôs rallying!
[24/07/18, 1:15:23 AM] Pranathi Chicago: He's super shocked at my mom's treatment of me which infuriates me
[24/07/18, 1:15:34 AM] Pranathi Chicago: It means he's never received any of this in his life
[24/07/18, 1:15:40 AM] Sush: True he probably hasn‚Äôt
[24/07/18, 1:15:49 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And that sort of privilege just enrages me. It's not his fault
[24/07/18, 1:15:59 AM] Sush: True
[24/07/18, 1:16:07 AM] Pranathi Chicago: But I'm just so angry that these battles aren't even his to fight
[24/07/18, 1:16:31 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I think going away is probably good. My mom just feels like I'm too different from her and the rest of them for my own good
[24/07/18, 1:16:47 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And she doesn't mind what I do unless I'm actually physically in this house
[24/07/18, 1:16:56 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Which sucks because it means this house doesn't feel like home
[24/07/18, 1:17:11 AM] Sush: True it isn‚Äôt fair to do that :(
[24/07/18, 1:17:29 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Anyway, sorry for going off and thank you for listening
[24/07/18, 1:17:42 AM] Sush: No no I would be infuriated too
[24/07/18, 1:17:43 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I'm just at my wits' end with her because she chooses precisely the wrong battles to fight
[24/07/18, 1:17:55 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I told her to stand up for herself more generally
[24/07/18, 1:18:10 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And I meant with my thatha and household chores and the maids who keep bunking
[24/07/18, 1:18:15 AM] Sush: ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
[24/07/18, 1:18:23 AM] Pranathi Chicago: But she's taken it to mean she has to stand up to me
[24/07/18, 1:18:30 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Shot myself in the foot with this one lol
[24/07/18, 1:18:37 AM] Sush: Lolol
[24/07/18, 1:19:05 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Issok, I'm just trying to let the days roll by but it's hard to separate all this from how I interact with her otherwise
[24/07/18, 1:19:20 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Trying to separate the issues but I can't get past this somehow

[24/07/18, 7:19:35 AM] Sush: Sorry I fell asleep when we were talking!!
[24/07/18, 7:19:34 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Hiiii I thought you might want to bitch about Vinay Sridhar's article in the Indian Express so I am offering up my services
[24/07/18, 7:19:41 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Ugh eees hate them
[24/07/18, 7:19:45 AM] Sush: Hahahaha I just saw it tooooo
[24/07/18, 7:19:50 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Lol no worries I was anyway randomly whining
[24/07/18, 7:20:13 AM] Pranathi Chicago: My only thought reading it was, aren't you one of these people tho?
[24/07/18, 7:20:38 AM] Sush: Ya little bit
[24/07/18, 7:20:49 AM] Sush: He‚Äôs pretty well versed in like Karnataka politics tho
[24/07/18, 7:21:28 AM] Sush: He‚Äôs so obsessed with Harvard üòÖ
[24/07/18, 7:22:26 AM] Pranathi Chicago: He writes well too
[24/07/18, 7:22:44 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Although the end with the whole female underprivileged Barack Obama crap was so trite
[24/07/18, 7:22:49 AM] Sush: He does. I wanted to hate the article so much more üò≠üò≠
[24/07/18, 7:23:01 AM] Sush: Agree and it reinforces his complaint
[24/07/18, 7:23:04 AM] Pranathi Chicago: It's like he undid the US as a point of comparison
[24/07/18, 7:23:10 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Argument
[24/07/18, 7:23:12 AM] Sush: Absolutely
[24/07/18, 7:23:40 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I want to say that I hate Indians who exalt Barack Obama as the paragon of virtue in politics also
[24/07/18, 7:23:47 AM] Sush: Yesssss
[24/07/18, 7:24:11 AM] Pranathi Chicago: That whole Obama is a miracle man mentality is so white liberal
[24/07/18, 7:24:25 AM] Sush: We have Dalit president now - says v v little about Dalits in India
[24/07/18, 7:24:32 AM] Pranathi Chicago: He's a man who disowned his own community in many ways
[24/07/18, 7:24:57 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah exactly. It's not like his intersectionality draws from specifically Indian categories of inequality
[24/07/18, 7:25:16 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And chumma you put one female Indian Obama statement and wowow so feminist ah
[24/07/18, 7:25:18 AM] Sush: Obama is a loved black man like Kalam was a loved Muslim man
[24/07/18, 7:25:41 AM] Sush: Loved for behaving white / upper caste Hindu
[24/07/18, 7:25:47 AM] Sush: ‚ÄòNot like them‚Äô
[24/07/18, 7:25:56 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah exactly. Respectability politics
[24/07/18, 7:26:07 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Good Muslim
[24/07/18, 7:26:11 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Good black
[24/07/18, 7:26:20 AM] Sush: hau!

[24/07/18, 7:26:35 AM] Sush: Won‚Äôt stir shit up
[24/07/18, 7:26:45 AM] Sush: yeah ugh lol
[24/07/18, 7:27:02 AM] Sush: I wanted to retweet it but I didn‚Äôt because I‚Äôm petty
[24/07/18, 7:27:11 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Haha I think that's valid
[24/07/18, 7:27:15 AM] Pranathi Chicago: You don't owe it to him
[24/07/18, 7:27:27 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I didn't ask for Sneha's article on Facebook because I'm petty :P
[24/07/18, 7:27:39 AM] Sush: I also didn‚Äôt ask ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
[24/07/18, 7:27:52 AM] Sush: Mostly because I‚Äôd have to make up stuff about loving it
[24/07/18, 7:27:53 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Lolol I just don't want to read it
[24/07/18, 7:28:02 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah exactlyyyy
[24/07/18, 7:28:04 AM] Sush: (Or scarier - id love it)
[24/07/18, 7:28:20 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And I have no energy to be gushy towards her
[24/07/18, 7:28:35 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Mostly afraid I'll go down a rabbit hole of what am I doing with my life
[24/07/18, 7:28:46 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And how did she get so many articles published in such a short life
[24/07/18, 7:28:47 AM] Sush: Fair üòÖ
[24/07/18, 7:28:57 AM] Sush: I have no excuse - I‚Äôm just being a bad friend
[24/07/18, 7:29:33 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Lolol no man issok, I think you're allowed to not be cheering her on for every single thing she does
[24/07/18, 7:29:43 AM] Sush: true
[24/07/18, 7:29:45 AM] Pranathi Chicago: With Sneha that would require lots of effort
[24/07/18, 7:29:46 AM] Sush: Stupid Vinay
[24/07/18, 7:29:53 AM] Pranathi Chicago: She does so many things
[24/07/18, 7:30:01 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Ugh Vinay
[24/07/18, 7:30:01 AM] Sush: She truly does üòÖ
[24/07/18, 7:30:34 AM] Sush: His need to belong in this global educated elite is sooo transparent
[24/07/18, 7:30:47 AM] Sush: and that desire is perfectly valid
[24/07/18, 7:30:52 AM] Sush: but it bugs me üòÖ
[24/07/18, 7:31:10 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Haha to be bugged by it is also valid
‚Äé[24/07/18, 7:38:49 AM] Sush: ‚Äéimage omitted
[24/07/18, 7:41:49 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Hahaha yessss
[24/07/18, 7:47:03 AM] Sush: It‚Äôs so interesting that Modi‚Äôs having been a tea seller doesn‚Äôt get similar traction
[24/07/18, 7:47:32 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Maybe he doesn't peddle that as much?
[24/07/18, 7:47:39 AM] Sush: Obama went to _harvard_
[24/07/18, 7:47:43 AM] Sush: Maybe
[24/07/18, 7:47:52 AM] Sush: Which is also a curious choice
[24/07/18, 7:54:20 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah it is curious, very curious
[24/07/18, 8:40:17 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Hey so I have some bad news
[24/07/18, 8:40:32 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Lakme stopped making the Scarlet Drill line :(

[24/07/18, 10:38:52 AM] Sush: I hate Lakme!!!
[24/07/18, 10:38:59 AM] Sush: They did this to apricot nectar also!
[24/07/18, 10:39:18 AM] Sush: Which was my Favvv until they discontinued it
[24/07/18, 10:40:22 AM] Sush: Don‚Äôt worry about a different colour I‚Äôll find something here
[24/07/18, 10:40:27 AM] Sush: Thank you for trying üòò
‚Äé[24/07/18, 11:40:56 AM] Sush: ‚Äéimage omitted
[24/07/18, 1:40:25 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Hahahaha
[24/07/18, 1:40:27 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Omg so true
[24/07/18, 1:40:38 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Btw I just saw Raazi!
[24/07/18, 2:34:40 PM] Sush: ooh how was it?
[24/07/18, 6:21:52 PM] Sush: Riddhima and I want to start lunch dabba service
[24/07/18, 6:21:54 PM] Sush: üëª
[24/07/18, 11:11:01 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Hi
[24/07/18, 11:11:06 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Sorry! I just woke up
[24/07/18, 11:11:10 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Still awake? :)
[24/07/18, 11:11:20 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Ooh lunch dabba service would be so nice
[24/07/18, 11:11:27 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Dabbawalis!
[24/07/18, 11:12:05 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Movie was decent. It was well made and engaging, but I'm not such a big fan of the country and patriotism above all else business
[24/07/18, 11:22:30 PM] Sush: Hiii
[24/07/18, 11:22:58 PM] Sush: Agreee but I also wonder if it is privilege that allows us to have that stance
[24/07/18, 11:25:23 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I'm not saying that she's at fault individually. I know joining the armed forces isn't really a matter of ideology for most people
[24/07/18, 11:25:45 PM] Pranathi Chicago: But I don't know if privilege has everything to do with blaming the institutions that create pawns out of individuals
[24/07/18, 11:25:58 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And taking a generally pacifist stance about war
[24/07/18, 11:33:18 PM] Sush: True
[24/07/18, 11:33:59 PM] Sush: I guess once you‚Äôre _in_ the army you need to believe that there‚Äôs a higher purpose to what you‚Äôre doing etc
[24/07/18, 11:34:24 PM] Sush: South India also insulates us so much, no?
[24/07/18, 11:34:54 PM] Sush: It‚Äôs interesting how the absence of like, partition trauma in the family etc probably influences how we feel
[24/07/18, 11:36:03 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah, I guess that's true
[24/07/18, 11:36:37 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I don't feel as strongly about Pakistan as someone who's probably witnessed trauma like partition
[24/07/18, 11:36:45 PM] Sush: How was Alia?
[24/07/18, 11:36:52 PM] Sush: Yeah, same
[24/07/18, 11:37:34 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah she was really good
[24/07/18, 11:37:39 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I think she's very talented
[24/07/18, 11:37:55 PM] Sush: She‚Äôs so talented üòç
[24/07/18, 11:38:00 PM] Sush: Where you saw?
[24/07/18, 11:38:05 PM] Sush: It‚Äôs not on Netflix no?
[24/07/18, 11:38:06 PM] Pranathi Chicago: At home
[24/07/18, 11:38:10 PM] Sush: I also want to see
[24/07/18, 11:38:11 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Amazon prime
[24/07/18, 11:38:15 PM] Sush: Ohhh ok ok
[24/07/18, 11:38:28 PM] Sush: Hey you want to watch Charulata when you return?
[24/07/18, 11:38:36 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Sure!
[24/07/18, 11:38:51 PM] Sush: We‚Äôll do movie and pizza night!
[24/07/18, 11:39:04 PM] Pranathi Chicago: That sounds so funnnn
[24/07/18, 11:39:10 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yessss :)
[24/07/18, 11:39:12 PM] Sush: I also want to watch one tam movie with Revati about women in the workplace
[24/07/18, 11:39:21 PM] Sush: Trying to remember what it‚Äôs called
[24/07/18, 11:39:43 PM] Sush: Magalir Mattum
[24/07/18, 11:41:41 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Oh yeah let's watchhhhh
[24/07/18, 11:44:17 PM] Sush: üëØüëØ
[24/07/18, 11:44:27 PM] Sush: I slept off at 7 and woke up an hour ago
[24/07/18, 11:44:33 PM] Sush: So wide awake and ugh
[24/07/18, 11:48:24 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Haha I hear you. I was like that last night
[25/07/18, 12:02:16 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I'm meeting Oviya for lunch tomorrow!
[25/07/18, 12:14:42 AM] Sush: Niice!
[25/07/18, 12:14:46 AM] Sush: Where are you two going
[25/07/18, 12:14:53 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Anokhi!
[25/07/18, 12:15:00 AM] Sush: Cutiesüòç
[25/07/18, 12:15:16 AM] Sush: So FOMO haha
[25/07/18, 12:16:10 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Haha and then dinner with your sister on Friday
[25/07/18, 12:16:21 AM] Sush: ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
[25/07/18, 12:16:22 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Sorry I feel like I am intensifying fomo
[25/07/18, 12:16:29 AM] Sush: I‚Äôm VERY happy you‚Äôre meeting my sister
[25/07/18, 12:16:38 AM] Pranathi Chicago: ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§ ME TOO.
[25/07/18, 12:16:41 AM] Pranathi Chicago: She seems so kind and lovely!
[25/07/18, 12:16:49 AM] Sush: You both are!
[25/07/18, 12:17:02 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Aww
[25/07/18, 12:17:05 AM] Pranathi Chicago: You also are
‚Äé[25/07/18, 12:17:26 AM] Sush: ‚Äéimage omitted

[25/07/18, 12:17:43 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Haha hi selfie creature

[25/07/18, 12:17:56 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I am meeting TM Krishna today
[25/07/18, 12:18:00 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Give ideas for interview questions
[25/07/18, 12:18:06 AM] Sush: Omg!!!
[25/07/18, 12:18:08 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I don't want to ask him anything too obvious because of his temper
[25/07/18, 12:18:20 AM] Sush: That is VERY exciting
[25/07/18, 12:18:24 AM] Pranathi Chicago: But I also don't want to make him do my dissertation
[25/07/18, 12:18:25 AM] Pranathi Chicago: So trying to strike the right balance
[25/07/18, 12:18:34 AM] Pranathi Chicago: His PA still hasn't sent me the address though
[25/07/18, 12:18:44 AM] Sush: Ohh I wonder where he lives lol
[25/07/18, 12:18:53 AM] Sush: So curious to hear about his house also!
[25/07/18, 12:19:46 AM] Pranathi Chicago: We're not meeting at his house
[25/07/18, 12:19:51 AM] Pranathi Chicago: We're meeting somewhere in Mylapore
[25/07/18, 12:19:56 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And that's all the information I've gotten so far
[25/07/18, 12:19:57 AM] Pranathi Chicago: :P
[25/07/18, 12:20:04 AM] Pranathi Chicago: It's like meeting some top secret government dude
[25/07/18, 12:20:10 AM] Sush: üòÇ
[25/07/18, 12:20:16 AM] Sush: Big day today üëØüëØ
[25/07/18, 12:22:48 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah haha
[25/07/18, 12:22:51 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I am excited!
[25/07/18, 12:22:53 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I hope he doesn't cancel
[25/07/18, 12:22:56 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I'll be very upset
[25/07/18, 12:23:01 AM] Pranathi Chicago: But tell question ideas no!
[25/07/18, 12:23:03 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I am nervous :P
[25/07/18, 12:30:14 AM] Sush: Thinking!
[25/07/18, 12:30:47 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Hi! Sorry, I am helping mom with lunch
[25/07/18, 12:30:50 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I will call after?
[25/07/18, 12:30:54 AM] Sush: No worriessss
[25/07/18, 12:31:04 AM] Sush: No rush nothing important haha
[25/07/18, 12:31:10 AM] Sush: Just called to talk about tmk
[25/07/18, 12:58:26 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Hi!
[25/07/18, 12:58:33 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Sorry, just finished
[25/07/18, 12:58:36 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Still up?
[25/07/18, 1:05:01 AM] Sush: Hiii
[25/07/18, 1:05:05 AM] Sush: Yes unfortunately
[25/07/18, 1:05:12 AM] Sush: I am wide awake ü§¨
[25/07/18, 1:05:36 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Ughh bugging!
[25/07/18, 1:05:42 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Is it hot in your apartment also?
[25/07/18, 1:05:51 AM] Sush: It is but I have my new friend
[25/07/18, 1:06:06 AM] Sush: My little AC robot
[25/07/18, 1:07:40 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Oh this is true
[25/07/18, 1:07:44 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Ac-shay?
[25/07/18, 1:07:58 AM] Sush: Just AC-man
[25/07/18, 1:08:13 AM] Sush: ü§ñ
[25/07/18, 1:18:03 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Dude these gaana people keep canceling on me
[25/07/18, 1:18:09 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And I really need them to engageeee
[25/07/18, 1:20:40 AM] Sush: ayyo
[25/07/18, 1:20:54 AM] Sush: do you think it feels like they're going out of their way to meet you?
[25/07/18, 1:21:06 AM] Sush: like is there anything you can do to make it logistically easier
[25/07/18, 1:21:10 AM] Sush: for them
[25/07/18, 1:21:13 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I'm going to their area only
[25/07/18, 1:21:25 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Like the guy I was supposed to meet today says he lives in Mylapore
[25/07/18, 1:21:32 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And I said I'd go there, he can tell me the place and time
[25/07/18, 1:21:43 AM] Pranathi Chicago: He said 3 pm and he'd tell me where. But now he's not responding
[25/07/18, 1:21:47 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I wonder if it's intimidating them
[25/07/18, 1:21:56 AM] Sush: ayyo
[25/07/18, 1:21:58 AM] Pranathi Chicago: When I say interview. I explained that it would be me just learning about their art form
[25/07/18, 1:22:05 AM] Sush: ya i wonder what's happening
[25/07/18, 1:22:09 AM] Pranathi Chicago: That I'd ask questions about how they started playing, where they play
[25/07/18, 1:22:19 AM] Pranathi Chicago: But I wonder if saying interview is scaring them off
[25/07/18, 1:22:34 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Also this idea of committing to an "appointment" is hard I think. It's definitely a classed notion
[25/07/18, 1:22:40 AM] Pranathi Chicago: That you meet at 3 pm at a coffee shop
[25/07/18, 1:22:45 AM] Sush: but i imagine your irb wouldn't  be ok to phrase it as something else?
[25/07/18, 1:22:50 AM] Sush: ya so true!
[25/07/18, 1:23:07 AM] Pranathi Chicago: It's not like I have IRB for this phase
[25/07/18, 1:23:20 AM] Pranathi Chicago: So I can frame it however, but I feel weird saying anything but
[25/07/18, 1:23:26 AM] Sush: ohh okay okay
[25/07/18, 1:23:30 AM] Sush: ya i hear you
[25/07/18, 1:23:42 AM] Sush: esp to frame it as professional, not personal
[25/07/18, 1:23:42 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I could just say conversation, but I don't want them to mistake that as me coming onto them
[25/07/18, 1:23:53 AM] Sush: hau correct
[25/07/18, 1:23:57 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah, like let's get coffee and talk
[25/07/18, 1:24:01 AM] Pranathi Chicago: It's inviting trouble
[25/07/18, 1:24:12 AM] Sush: it is it is
[25/07/18, 1:24:20 AM] Sush: and this keeps what they say 'on the record'
[25/07/18, 1:24:31 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Like they seem to want to talk to me, because this one guy keeps sending me his videos
[25/07/18, 1:24:35 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And sending good morning good night messages
[25/07/18, 1:24:43 AM] Sush: lol those are so confuse
[25/07/18, 1:24:46 AM] Pranathi Chicago: But maybe the idea of actually answering a bunch of questions one on one is intimidating
[25/07/18, 1:24:48 AM] Sush: i used to get from my surveyors
[25/07/18, 1:24:54 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah?
[25/07/18, 1:24:58 AM] Sush: soo many good morning flowers
[25/07/18, 1:25:01 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I just don't respond when I get those
[25/07/18, 1:25:06 AM] Pranathi Chicago: So maybe I've offended them also
[25/07/18, 1:25:25 AM] Sush: maybe once in a while you can say 'beautiful messages' or something
[25/07/18, 1:25:54 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Lolol
[25/07/18, 1:25:56 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Good point
[25/07/18, 1:26:11 AM] Pranathi Chicago: It's hard to strike this balance of being professional but also not appearing cold
[25/07/18, 1:26:19 AM] Sush: but i also doubt those messages are meant to elicit replies
[25/07/18, 1:27:12 AM] Pranathi Chicago: That's true. I'm not sure if I'm doing something wrong in the general rules of conduct though
[25/07/18, 1:30:28 AM] Sush: you think sneha might have any insights?
[25/07/18, 1:30:33 AM] Sush: maybe oves will tomorrow
[25/07/18, 1:39:19 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah I'll talk to Oviya tomorrow
[25/07/18, 1:41:52 AM] Pranathi Chicago: We had this cat that kept coming around the house, and it had a litter of three kittens. We found out that some stray dogs snatched up two of the kittens last night and it's really sad. This cat's so disconsolate it breaks my heart. We saw the mom cat fight off the two dogs but they overpowered her. It's really so sad
[25/07/18, 1:46:51 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Actually I'm realizing it's not just these guys. Even some of the band guys I wanted to interview (F-16s, Non-violinists), they've also been flakes. I wonder how much of it is just the whole being a musician thing.
[25/07/18, 1:47:06 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Like they're hustling pretty hard and I have nothing to offer them in return, so it's probably easier to flake?
[25/07/18, 1:47:45 AM] Sush: oh my gosh!!!
[25/07/18, 1:47:51 AM] Sush: freaking dogs
[25/07/18, 1:48:02 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah, we saw the video on the security camera
[25/07/18, 1:48:09 AM] Pranathi Chicago: The mom cat was so scared paavam!
[25/07/18, 1:48:13 AM] Sush: possibly!
[25/07/18, 1:48:17 AM] Sush: paapa!!!!
[25/07/18, 1:49:10 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Sorry for going on about the musicians. It's probably annoying to hear my thought process right now lol
[25/07/18, 1:50:38 AM] Sush: pfft no not at all!
[25/07/18, 1:50:48 AM] Sush: this is a significant thing you're undertaking!
[25/07/18, 1:51:07 AM] Pranathi Chicago: ‚ù§ Thank youuuuu
[25/07/18, 1:51:15 AM] Pranathi Chicago: So okay I finally got the address
[25/07/18, 1:51:19 AM] Pranathi Chicago: So this is happening

[25/07/18, 1:51:22 AM] Sush: oooooh!!
[25/07/18, 1:51:24 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I think I'm going to his house
[25/07/18, 1:51:27 AM] Sush: what are you wearing!
[25/07/18, 1:51:27 AM] Pranathi Chicago: TMK I mean
[25/07/18, 1:51:31 AM] Pranathi Chicago: LOL
[25/07/18, 1:51:33 AM] Sush: sorry lol
[25/07/18, 1:51:39 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Probably kurta and leggings
[25/07/18, 1:51:40 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Hahaha
[25/07/18, 1:51:43 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Why are you saying sorry
[25/07/18, 1:51:46 AM] Sush: hahaha
[25/07/18, 1:51:50 AM] Pranathi Chicago: It's a good question. Hadn't thought about it :P
[25/07/18, 1:51:54 AM] Pranathi Chicago: What should I wear?
[25/07/18, 1:52:10 AM] Sush: kurta and leggings sounds good!
[25/07/18, 1:52:36 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Okay. I don't want to appear too TamBrahm also. In case he starts taking umbrage at that
[25/07/18, 1:52:50 AM] Sush: ya i was thinking :P

[25/07/18, 10:45:39 PM] Pranathi Chicago: She's so smart
[25/07/18, 10:45:45 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And unpretentious
[25/07/18, 10:45:45 PM] Sush: She is
[25/07/18, 10:45:59 PM] Sush: She played that Hrithik Roshan thing v weirdly tho
[25/07/18, 10:46:06 PM] Pranathi Chicago: What was that?
[25/07/18, 10:46:26 PM] Sush: She went on and on and on about how they had an affair and he broke up with her
[25/07/18, 10:46:44 PM] Sush: While he didn‚Äôt acknowledge anything and was like wtf are you talking about
[25/07/18, 10:47:04 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Weeeeird
[25/07/18, 10:47:11 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Do you think she was lying?
[25/07/18, 10:47:34 PM] Sush: Who knows :/
[25/07/18, 10:47:43 PM] Sush: He seems like an asshole so idk
[25/07/18, 10:48:09 PM] Sush: But it was like why you‚Äôre washing dirty laundry in public when the other person won‚Äôt acknowledge
[25/07/18, 10:48:22 PM] Sush: and it wasn‚Äôt assault or anything
[25/07/18, 10:48:51 PM] Sush: But it probably suuuuuucks to be in that place
[25/07/18, 10:49:03 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah for sure
[25/07/18, 10:49:10 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I guess eventually you get cynical and lack
[25/07/18, 10:49:12 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Pack
[25/07/18, 10:49:14 PM] Sush: Paapa
[25/07/18, 10:49:16 PM] Sush: Maybe
[25/07/18, 10:49:30 PM] Pranathi Chicago: But in the beginning it must suck to not have anyone take you seriously or to feel like no one will believe you
[25/07/18, 10:49:37 PM] Sush: Yeah!!
[25/07/18, 10:50:14 PM] Sush: And all these people closed ranks after she called them out on Koffee with Karan
[25/07/18, 10:50:37 PM] Sush: Horrid fellows
[25/07/18, 11:04:18 PM] Sush: can i tell you something????
[25/07/18, 11:04:21 PM] Sush: it is absurd

[25/07/18, 11:08:01 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Ohhh why are you worried about mercury retrograde?
[25/07/18, 11:08:26 PM] Sush: it is bad for scorpio career and finances it seems!
[25/07/18, 11:08:44 PM] Sush: like either of those could get ANY WORSE
[25/07/18, 11:09:04 PM] Sush: ofc my horoscope also said i'll FIND love last nov

[25/07/18, 11:11:07 PM] Sush: trooooo
[25/07/18, 11:11:09 PM] Pranathi Chicago: It's like WebMD with me
[25/07/18, 11:11:12 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Potent crap
[25/07/18, 11:11:14 PM] Sush: correct
[25/07/18, 11:11:31 PM] Pranathi Chicago: It's not a sign and a different website will probably tell you the opposite
[25/07/18, 11:11:41 PM] Pranathi Chicago: But the worry is real and I understand the anxiety üíï
[25/07/18, 11:11:56 PM] Pranathi Chicago: It's probably just projection though! Don't read too much into it
[25/07/18, 11:12:28 PM] Sush: you're right
[25/07/18, 11:16:05 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Sorry if I'm not being helpful
[25/07/18, 11:16:31 PM] Sush: no no it is such an irrational anxiety :P

[26/07/18, 2:10:46 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I once came the day it started and it took me three hours
[26/07/18, 2:10:58 PM] Sush: Ugh that sucks
[26/07/18, 2:11:01 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Nothing happened! Just feeling broody

[26/07/18, 2:11:18 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Wednesday morning
[26/07/18, 2:11:24 PM] Sush: The night can do that no? :/
[26/07/18, 2:11:30 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I think I'll take train till Jackson
[26/07/18, 2:11:39 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeahhhh something about night time
[26/07/18, 2:11:42 PM] Sush: Haan you‚Äôll beat the worst of it then
[26/07/18, 2:11:44 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I've been having such weird dreams also
[26/07/18, 2:11:57 PM] Sush: Oh man I‚Äôm sorry those are so disconcerting
[26/07/18, 2:12:07 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeahhh the Nick dream sort of messed me up
[26/07/18, 2:12:20 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I wish I could just ask him to get a cup of coffee with me to talk about some things
[26/07/18, 2:12:44 PM] Pranathi Chicago: But I know he'll ignore and I don't want to be in the position of asking or being rejected
[26/07/18, 2:12:47 PM] Sush: Will it help to articulate what you want from him?
[26/07/18, 2:13:02 PM] Sush: Like, to me or to yourself - not him
[26/07/18, 2:13:37 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I don't know. I think I just want some answers to stuff that I don't know. Like how did that happen with Lauren, how long had they been texting
[26/07/18, 2:13:47 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I don't know if it would make me feel better
[26/07/18, 2:13:58 PM] Pranathi Chicago: But it would make a year and a half ago me feel vindicated
[26/07/18, 2:14:01 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Like I wasn't crazy
[26/07/18, 2:14:13 PM] Sush: True - you‚Äôre definitely not crazy
[26/07/18, 2:14:30 PM] Sush: Whether it was two weeks or ten you were right to be suspicious
[26/07/18, 2:14:40 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And I think I want an apology. Like an honest to god apology just saying there were no excuses to be made
[26/07/18, 2:14:45 PM] Pranathi Chicago: It wasn't about my weight
[26/07/18, 2:15:16 PM] Pranathi Chicago: All that stuff he said, I want him to really feel like shit for ever letting me feel that way after being sneaky about this
[26/07/18, 2:15:38 PM] Pranathi Chicago: But I think this is all just about me, not about him
[26/07/18, 2:15:41 PM] Sush: God knows you deserve that
[26/07/18, 2:15:58 PM] Sush: But I wouldn‚Äôt hold my breath to hear an apology from him though :/
[26/07/18, 2:16:01 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Both him and Suraj. Neither has apologized to me
[26/07/18, 2:16:09 PM] Sush: It sounds like he‚Äôs rationalised it to himself somehow
[26/07/18, 2:16:13 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And I think I feel really sore about it
[26/07/18, 2:16:20 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Like didn't I even deserve that much
[26/07/18, 2:16:26 PM] Sush: And clearly the fact that he can‚Äôt even face you is proof of his cowardice
[26/07/18, 2:16:31 PM] Sush: You really do :(
[26/07/18, 2:17:04 PM] Sush: I feel like calling him and saying you asshole you owe her an apology
[26/07/18, 2:17:07 PM] Pranathi Chicago: It makes me feel so sad to think how naive I was. Like I want to hug earlier me and also give one proper tight slap
[26/07/18, 2:17:15 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Awwwww that is so so kind
[26/07/18, 2:17:22 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Just the sentiment means a lot to me
[26/07/18, 2:17:26 PM] Pranathi Chicago: üíïüíï
[26/07/18, 2:17:31 PM] Sush: Better to be naive that cynical and closed off ‚ù§Ô∏è
[26/07/18, 2:17:44 PM] Sush: I will HAPPILY do it if you say the word
[26/07/18, 2:17:48 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah but I think I've gotten cynical and closed off
[26/07/18, 2:18:08 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And I blame both of them for behaving in ways that make me trust men so little
[26/07/18, 2:18:13 PM] Sush: You‚Äôve also not met anyone worth buying into
[26/07/18, 2:18:40 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I would ask you to, but also I know he'd be an asshole to you and I couldn't bear to have that happen
[26/07/18, 2:18:49 PM] Pranathi Chicago: He'd probably hang up
[26/07/18, 2:19:17 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Or if he was Suraj, he'd call me and yell at me for disturbing his domestic bliss
[26/07/18, 2:19:22 PM] Sush: Hanging up is the worst he can do to me! He barely knows he he has no power to hurt my feelings
[26/07/18, 2:19:30 PM] Sush: Lol I can‚Äôt believe Suraj did that
[26/07/18, 2:19:51 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Lol yeah. He did that after he heard from Manasa that I bitched about Samvita
[26/07/18, 2:19:57 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And asked me to stop spreading slander lolol
[26/07/18, 2:20:02 PM] Sush: Ugh
[26/07/18, 2:20:06 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Asked no, yelled
[26/07/18, 2:20:09 PM] Sush: Suraj is such a WEAK person
[26/07/18, 2:20:24 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah, but I think if I get an apology from him, I want it to be from his own remorse
[26/07/18, 2:20:34 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I think he knows what he's done is shit but will never admit to it
[26/07/18, 2:20:34 PM] Sush: Entirely fair
[26/07/18, 2:20:39 PM] Sush: True
[26/07/18, 2:20:45 PM] Pranathi Chicago: It's not like he has to realize, he knows and he just can't own up to it
[26/07/18, 2:20:54 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Because like Suraj, he is also weak
[26/07/18, 2:20:59 PM] Sush: And he‚Äôs rolling around in $ to convince himself he‚Äôs fine
[26/07/18, 2:21:04 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I dated two cowards, yuck
[26/07/18, 2:21:07 PM] Sush: Yak
[26/07/18, 2:21:18 PM] Sush: Statistically overwhelmingly likely tho
[26/07/18, 2:21:25 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah I saw his new girlfriend's profile picture because I have a death wish
[26/07/18, 2:21:28 PM] Sush: Given that you date men
[26/07/18, 2:21:32 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And she is in golf clothes
[26/07/18, 2:21:38 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Lolol sadly too true
[26/07/18, 2:21:42 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Golf clothes ughhh
[26/07/18, 2:21:54 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Only rich people unironically wear golf clothes
[26/07/18, 2:21:59 PM] Sush: Lolol true
[26/07/18, 2:22:06 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And he must love that whole glitzy life
[26/07/18, 2:22:17 PM] Pranathi Chicago: He even told me how her dad owns some hotel in the Gold Coast
[26/07/18, 2:22:30 PM] Pranathi Chicago: It gives me acid to think of the two of them together
[26/07/18, 2:22:38 PM] Sush: So lame they sound
[26/07/18, 2:22:38 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Sorry I am going off about this
[26/07/18, 2:22:43 PM] Sush: How can we reduce acid?
[26/07/18, 2:22:49 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I just haven't thought about it in a while and that dream made me feel baaaaf
[26/07/18, 2:22:51 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Baaaad
[26/07/18, 2:23:02 PM] Sush: Ultimately acid erodes us only. How shall we neutralise?
[26/07/18, 2:23:09 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Be basic?
[26/07/18, 2:23:13 PM] Pranathi Chicago: See what I did there?
[26/07/18, 2:23:14 PM] Sush: üòÇüòò
[26/07/18, 2:23:29 PM] Sush: this is why we are friends
[26/07/18, 2:23:40 PM] Sush: because I‚Äôll laugh at all this
[26/07/18, 2:23:45 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Lol issok, I think I should interpret that dream as me coming to grips with never having that closure and still being able to do cult level magic
[26/07/18, 2:23:54 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Awww that is true friendship üòòüòç
[26/07/18, 2:24:01 PM] Sush: You are a magical person!

[28/07/18, 12:40:47 PM] Sush: ok this recipe look good
[28/07/18, 12:40:50 PM] Sush: we should tryy
[28/07/18, 12:40:53 PM] Sush: The small sized eggplants are halved and slit and then you sprinkle salt and red chili powder and leave for at least 15 minutes, max for an hour. This time the baingan I used was not too fresh, was apprehensive of using them but went ahead and removed the stalks and quartered them lengthwise. 
In the mean while you roast some fenugreek seeds, fennel seeds and red chilies over low flame till they get fragrant but don't let them get too dark. Cool.and powder coarsely. 
Now heat mustard oil in a shallow pan and arrange the brinjal wedges all over. Let them brown on one side and turn them to brown on all sides. Now sprinkle the ground masala generousely, some amchoor powder and some jaggery powder. For about 250 gm I used 1 tbsp of jaggery powder, note that they key is to make the chili heat, amchoor and jaggery well balanced. 
Toss well and serve hot.
[28/07/18, 12:41:12 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Is this baingan bhaja?
[28/07/18, 12:41:15 PM] Sush: khatta meetha baingan

[29/07/18, 9:48:46 AM] Sush: The other was going to some video game place???
[29/07/18, 9:49:02 AM] Sush: Except you have to get there in a bus that‚Äôs hauled up by a rope

[29/07/18, 11:58:21 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Also realized that he really did the whole "you made me want to break up with you" thing so well that deep down I really believed I deserved all of it and even with Nick I subconsciously felt like it was all my doing
[29/07/18, 1:36:07 PM] Sush: Oh my god

[29/07/18, 10:54:46 PM] Sush: Ya chee for his face
[29/07/18, 10:54:57 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Why should I handle anything with poise after his bad behavior?

[29/07/18, 10:55:43 PM] Sush: Be quiet and thankful I even gave you the time of day
[29/07/18, 10:55:45 PM] Pranathi Chicago: If I wasn't so hopping mad at his entitlement
[29/07/18, 10:55:48 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah exactly.
[29/07/18, 10:55:59 PM] Pranathi Chicago: He made me feel so deranged after that
[29/07/18, 10:56:17 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Like I was completely not understanding what a crazy person I was
[29/07/18, 10:56:19 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Gross

[30/07/18, 5:58:27 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I was reading and left phone charging
[30/07/18, 5:58:32 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I hope you got some sleep
[30/07/18, 5:58:36 AM] Pranathi Chicago: üòò

[30/07/18, 7:52:57 AM] Sush: So trueee
[30/07/18, 7:54:04 AM] Sush: Are you all packed?
[30/07/18, 7:54:11 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Noooo I'm working lol
[30/07/18, 7:54:46 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I have to pack. I haven't bought a lot of things I wanted to buy also
[30/07/18, 7:54:53 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Whatever, it's not like I can't get there I guess!
[30/07/18, 7:55:01 AM] Pranathi Chicago: When did you end up sleeping?
[30/07/18, 7:55:11 AM] Sush: True - like what?
[30/07/18, 7:55:25 AM] Sush: Like 2:30 ish I think
[30/07/18, 7:55:38 AM] Sush: also I think my NW won‚Äôt work out :/
[30/07/18, 7:55:49 AM] Sush: He said he‚Äôll keep digging with HR and get back to me
[30/07/18, 7:56:01 AM] Sush: But it sounds like bad news
[30/07/18, 7:56:04 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I wanted to get some spices and all
[30/07/18, 7:56:10 AM] Pranathi Chicago: But issok, Metro is there
[30/07/18, 7:56:18 AM] Sush: Fair. Soooo much cheaper
[30/07/18, 7:56:33 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Ugh, I'm sorry to hear that. :( That's really shitty. Especially since you liked the guy so much!
[30/07/18, 7:56:38 AM] Sush: I‚Äôm feeling slightly bitter about it
[30/07/18, 7:56:50 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah, as you should. The Visa thing is such BULLSHIT
[30/07/18, 7:56:57 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I can't believe that's a consideration over fit and expertise
[30/07/18, 7:57:19 AM] Sush: I probably made a huge mistake turning down a stable offer that came months ago
[30/07/18, 7:57:35 AM] Sush: I‚Äôm paying for my arrogance or whatever now
[30/07/18, 7:58:03 AM] Pranathi Chicago: No, it just feels that way now because you haven't struck gold yet. But I'll remind you that you were *very* happy after you turned them down and you said you'd have been miserable if you'd worked for them
[30/07/18, 7:58:29 AM] Sush: that is true but if I‚Äôd known I‚Äôd have no other options
[30/07/18, 7:58:45 AM] Sush: Way less misery than unemployment or returning to India and spending 15 years in debt
[30/07/18, 7:59:03 AM] Sush: I‚Äôm feeling v defeated
[30/07/18, 7:59:05 AM] Pranathi Chicago: We don't know that that's the only option left!
[30/07/18, 7:59:13 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I definitely think it's more of the waiting game
[30/07/18, 7:59:14 AM] Sush: like all I know how to do is be the right man for a job
[30/07/18, 7:59:19 AM] Pranathi Chicago: But I can tooootaally understand
[30/07/18, 7:59:25 AM] Sush: If that‚Äôs not enough idk how to navigate this
[30/07/18, 7:59:35 AM] Pranathi Chicago: It must feel so so so harrowing to deal with this uncertainty

[29/08/18, 11:21:28 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Was it an accident?
[29/08/18, 11:21:34 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Or a fight broke out?
[29/08/18, 11:25:13 PM] Sush: i think a fight maybe
[29/08/18, 11:25:19 PM] Sush: there were some 5 police cars
[29/08/18, 11:25:24 PM] Sush: and general shouting
[29/08/18, 11:27:29 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Man

[30/08/18, 2:09:18 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Whoa! That escalated quickly
[30/08/18, 2:09:31 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I don't get why the anger?
[30/08/18, 2:09:49 AM] Sush: Right?!
[30/08/18, 2:09:52 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Maybe it's one of those tone things
[30/08/18, 2:10:02 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Like she misunderstood what you were saying because of text
‚Äé[30/08/18, 2:10:07 AM] Sush: ‚Äéimage omitted
[30/08/18, 2:10:07 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And then overreacted maybe?
[30/08/18, 2:10:29 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Ugh that's horrible though
[30/08/18, 2:10:31 AM] Sush: again I‚Äôm apologising lol
[30/08/18, 2:10:40 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Hmmmm
[30/08/18, 2:10:47 AM] Pranathi Chicago: You shouldn't have to apologize tho
[30/08/18, 2:10:54 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I don't think you were being rude or anything
[30/08/18, 2:11:04 AM] Sush: ya and like so much aggression
[30/08/18, 2:10:59 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Or not letting her share her opinion
[30/08/18, 2:11:08 AM] Sush: I was like peace out
[30/08/18, 2:11:10 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah that's a lot a lot
[30/08/18, 2:11:22 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Maybe she's taking something else out on you
[30/08/18, 2:11:40 AM] Sush: ‚ÄòI will not tolerate this‚Äô is hearing my opinion
[30/08/18, 2:11:44 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Like needing you to be a lot of things because of loneliness, new place etc. etc
[30/08/18, 2:11:50 AM] Sush: but me saying eh peace out is not hearing her opinion
[30/08/18, 2:11:56 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And then getting frustrated when you obviously can't be her everything
[30/08/18, 2:12:10 AM] Sush: ya idk how to be there for her rn
[30/08/18, 2:12:24 AM] Sush: She is struggling to let me in and resenting me for not pushing harder
[30/08/18, 2:12:41 AM] Sush: I am struggling to push also
[30/08/18, 2:12:51 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I think she's crafted the perfect reaction and needs you to match it, but you never will
[30/08/18, 2:13:07 AM] Sush: because I have been rejected by jobs boyfriends best friends literally everything this past year
[30/08/18, 2:13:41 AM] Sush: I know this is a huge transition for her
[30/08/18, 2:13:48 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah. Maybe you should tell her all this? I feel like she's maybe pushing you to be real with her
[30/08/18, 2:13:55 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Even if it results in some yelling matches
[30/08/18, 2:13:57 AM] Sush: Maybe I should just be more patient or something
[30/08/18, 2:14:06 AM] Sush: ya maybe
[30/08/18, 2:14:16 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I dunno obviously, all conjecture here
[30/08/18, 2:14:17 AM] Sush: I think she felt bad I didn‚Äôt tell her about SF etc
[30/08/18, 2:14:28 AM] Sush: I told her just now
[30/08/18, 2:14:48 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I don't think you have to feel as though you owe anyone every little detail
[30/08/18, 2:15:02 AM] Pranathi Chicago: It's a slippery slope to codependency and hurt feelings from there on out
[30/08/18, 2:15:06 AM] Sush: like she felt bad I didn‚Äôt each out when I was obviously struggling
[30/08/18, 2:15:13 AM] Sush: *reach
[30/08/18, 2:15:26 AM] Pranathi Chicago: But I can also see how she's flailing and probably feels like you're both unable to connect
[30/08/18, 2:15:32 AM] Sush: idk anything anymore ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
[30/08/18, 2:15:39 AM] Sush: Ya we are struggling to connect
[30/08/18, 2:15:55 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Don't question the whole relationship and all. I think it's just a matter of talking about it
[30/08/18, 2:16:06 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Just because some relationships have failed doesn't mean they'll all fail
[30/08/18, 2:16:07 AM] Sush: True
[30/08/18, 2:16:27 AM] Sush: Did you suddenly wake up paapa?
[30/08/18, 2:16:41 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Each person is so complex and each person in your life will invariably end up having different paths in their relationship with you
[30/08/18, 2:16:49 AM] Pranathi Chicago: They won't all just leave
[30/08/18, 2:16:50 AM] Sush: Yeah üò≠
[30/08/18, 2:16:55 AM] Sush: I hope so
[30/08/18, 2:16:55 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Nope lol
[30/08/18, 2:16:59 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I have been crying
[30/08/18, 2:17:02 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And feeling sorry for self
[30/08/18, 2:17:10 AM] Sush: Oh no! Why, love?
[30/08/18, 2:17:16 AM] Sush: Movie was triggering? :(
[30/08/18, 2:17:16 AM] Pranathi Chicago: It's Nick's birthday today
[30/08/18, 2:17:23 AM] Sush: Ohhh
[30/08/18, 2:17:31 AM] Sush: When you guys spoke last?
[30/08/18, 2:17:39 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And I realized this day last year was the last time we spoke
[30/08/18, 2:17:42 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah
[30/08/18, 2:17:53 AM] Sush: Ayy I‚Äôm sorry :(
[30/08/18, 2:17:59 AM] Sush: It really sucks how that went down
[30/08/18, 2:18:00 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And I'm like sitting here marking time in how many days it's been since we last spoke
[30/08/18, 2:18:26 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And he's probably thinking, oh I started a relationship with this woman I'm in bed with a year ago
[30/08/18, 2:18:53 AM] Sush: He‚Äôs probably just thinking about his own dick face :/
[30/08/18, 2:19:04 AM] Pranathi Chicago: It's funny how we each have our own personal calendars marking anniversaries of trauma and joy
[30/08/18, 2:19:12 AM] Sush: yeahhh
[30/08/18, 2:19:23 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I think it just sucks because I think he really did love me
[30/08/18, 2:19:25 AM] Sush: makes calendar years seem so arbitrary
[30/08/18, 2:19:30 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And I think I really did love him
[30/08/18, 2:19:38 AM] Sush: it does suck a lot :(
[30/08/18, 2:19:52 AM] Sush: and it‚Äôs totally understandable and valid to feel sad about it
[30/08/18, 2:19:57 AM] Pranathi Chicago: We almost moved in, we talked about getting married and all
[30/08/18, 2:20:00 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Like wtf
[30/08/18, 2:20:13 AM] Sush: incredible how that can just...change
[30/08/18, 2:20:15 AM] Pranathi Chicago: You don't just do that and then dump someone on their sorry ass
[30/08/18, 2:20:25 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah
[30/08/18, 2:20:51 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Sorry, there isn't much to say, I know. That's why I didn't text because there isn't much to say
[30/08/18, 2:20:57 AM] Pranathi Chicago: It's the same thing all over again
[30/08/18, 2:21:06 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And I'm just bummed I'm still thinking about it a year later
[30/08/18, 2:21:12 AM] Sush: No no, I can 100% understand!
[30/08/18, 2:21:32 AM] Sush: It feels annoying also, on top of feeling sad, no?
[30/08/18, 2:21:48 AM] Sush: Like ugh FEELING I have felt you so often and for so long why can‚Äôt you just leave
[30/08/18, 2:22:06 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And tomorrow is the jazz festival, where I met that dumbass Andrew. Which wasn't even close to being the same thing, but I was so NAIVE to try and do it again with that fuckwad
[30/08/18, 2:22:27 AM] Sush: that was probably a coping mechanism no?
[30/08/18, 2:22:31 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And Andrew was the last time I felt invested in any sort of romantic relationship
[30/08/18, 2:22:33 AM] Sush: chew toying
[30/08/18, 2:22:40 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Like a whole goddamn year ago now
[30/08/18, 2:22:56 AM] Sush: find a boy less painful than nick to fixate on?
[30/08/18, 2:23:04 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah you're right
[30/08/18, 2:23:18 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Although Andrew ended up tearing that wound open
[30/08/18, 2:23:23 AM] Sush: It was probably sooo many nick feelings being projected onto him
[30/08/18, 2:23:40 AM] Sush: and a different dude being the subject of it feels like moving on from nick also
[30/08/18, 2:23:41 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Ghosting me like a total twat
[30/08/18, 2:23:49 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah true
[30/08/18, 2:24:03 AM] Sush: what an immature little gnat
[30/08/18, 2:24:06 AM] Pranathi Chicago: We both were projecting a bunch of shit onto each other
[30/08/18, 2:24:18 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Anyway, Nick is the real annoyance
[30/08/18, 2:24:24 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I wish he'd really just go away
[30/08/18, 2:24:39 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I was thinking about how like in March last year
[30/08/18, 2:24:46 AM] Pranathi Chicago: He said he was going to move to Minneapolis
[30/08/18, 2:24:52 AM] Pranathi Chicago: For some job he got
[30/08/18, 2:25:00 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And then he asked if I could go with him
[30/08/18, 2:25:10 AM] Sush: oh man
[30/08/18, 2:25:15 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I said I couldn't quit PhD and just leave, especially since I'd get deported
[30/08/18, 2:25:32 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And then he asked what if we got married, since he'd been thinking about it forever anyway
[30/08/18, 2:25:36 AM] Pranathi Chicago: WTF
[30/08/18, 2:25:44 AM] Sush: whoaaaa
[30/08/18, 2:25:45 AM] Pranathi Chicago: While he was texting that woman
[30/08/18, 2:26:07 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah. So when he said that, and he was going to meet my parents and all, I got way ahead of myself
[30/08/18, 2:26:23 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And clearly thought he was in a totally different place than he actually was
[30/08/18, 2:26:47 AM] Sush: he gave you every reason to think so
[30/08/18, 2:26:49 AM] Pranathi Chicago: It just really sucks to remember it all over again. Like really, really sucks.

[30/08/18, 2:27:00 AM] Sush: I can imagine :(
[30/08/18, 2:27:12 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Texting some random boys on Tinder who I have no intention of actually seeing ever
[30/08/18, 2:27:28 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And it feels worse off than all of that I had with Nick by far
[30/08/18, 2:27:50 AM] Sush: Online dating sucks so much :/
[30/08/18, 2:27:54 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I know that's not true, because we had plenty of messed up shit, but it feels this way when I have my rose tinted retrospecs on
[30/08/18, 2:28:09 AM] Sush: modern society hasn‚Äôt figured out a way to match up its single young people

[30/08/18, 2:29:13 AM] Pranathi Chicago: It hasn't been this bad in a long time.
[30/08/18, 2:29:27 AM] Pranathi Chicago: But I had that crushing feeling on my chest that I get sometimes when I'm really sad
[30/08/18, 2:29:41 AM] Sush: Movie + birthday must have been triggering :/
[30/08/18, 2:29:45 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Like it hurts to breathe and move my ribcage

[04/09/18, 9:21:42 PM] Sush: ü§£
[04/09/18, 9:57:54 PM] Sush: sorry, i didn't mean to snap
[04/09/18, 9:59:51 PM] Sush: i think i bristled slightly earlier when you said it was sad to say that i felt like having put on weight was 'depressing' - like  i know it isn't ideal, but i guess it is kinda how it is for me as things stand atm
[04/09/18, 9:59:58 PM] Sush: i was misplacing that
[04/09/18, 10:00:24 PM] Sush: i should've just brought it up like a grown-up than hold on to that stress
[04/09/18, 10:05:15 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I know you're stressed, and I empathize and can only imagine. You're under a lot of pressure. It's just that I'm at a loss for words sometimes when you talk about it. I feel like I'm endlessly saying things that aren't going to land well. I feel like I'm hurting you by saying something that in my head sounds innocuous. I don't mean you any harm and I didn't mean to make you upset by saying any of that.
[04/09/18, 10:07:45 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I didn't think that the sadness comment would strike such a nerve because I guess I didn't realize it was actually a problem you're still contending with. I'm sorry if it came across wrong when I said I'm sad. What I think I meant to say is that I care.
[04/09/18, 10:11:52 PM] Sush: No, I know you don't intend any harm whatsoever! I'm not doing the best job of handling this whole time of my life also - it's scary and isolating - I'm spending so much energy trying not freak out, I end up reacting to innocuous things and that's not fair to you. I know you feel at a loss for words also - I guess I just feel the need to say it out loud and just have someone hear me say it. I don't feel like I can talk to my parents about it because they'll ask three million questions.
[04/09/18, 10:15:25 PM] Sush: I know what you mean. I was feeling silly to bring it up because I knew your intentions were good, that it struck a nerve is more reflective of my lifelong insecurities about weight than anything else.
[04/09/18, 10:20:55 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I hear you and want you to know that I understand it's scary and isolating. But you'll have to tell me what I can say to let you know I'm listening and I care. Right now, I feel like I'm walking on eggshells, and I feel as though a lot of the things I'm saying in this gush of eagerness to comfort are just triggering you.
[04/09/18, 10:22:43 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I really don't want to be one more stressor in your life, and none of the stuff I'm saying is really more than a lame effort to comfort you and let you know I'm there.
[04/09/18, 10:23:17 PM] Sush: No, you're a giant source of comfort in my life!
[04/09/18, 10:23:27 PM] Sush: like, big fat
[04/09/18, 10:26:30 PM] Sush: I don't want you to feel wary around me also. I guess I just don't want to hear that other people get through it / it happens all the time. I know that in theory, it just doesn't really mitigate the fear I'm low-key feeling constantly. I know it isn't your intention to suggest that I'm freaking out over nothing, but maybe some words suggest that and I have to remind myself that that isn't your intention.
[06/09/18, 1:10:25 AM] Pranathi Chicago: That sounds like 99 bottles on the wall
[06/09/18, 1:10:31 AM] Pranathi Chicago: 99 bottles of beer on the wall

[06/09/18, 1:23:45 AM] Pranathi Chicago: That's so refreshing
[06/09/18, 1:24:46 AM] Pranathi Chicago: An alliance of churches and a Christian group Trust of God Ministries have opposed scrapping of the colonial-era law.

[09/10/18, 8:10:22 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Dude, I had the scariest experience with Loren. We were supposed to go to the Moth today. We got here and he was behaving sort of weirdly. Then when they announced the first storyteller, he ran up on stage. So I ran behind him. He tried to wrestle the microphone from the host's hand. And the lady was telling him to back off. I had to physically wrestle him off stage, and then he refused to go. So they called security and we both had to physically drag him off. He tried to take off his shirt.
[09/10/18, 8:11:41 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Then as we were going to call him an Uber, he tried to touch me. He touched my butt and then aggressively tried to hold my hand. I freaked out and yelled at him, but he couldn't leave because he left his phone upstairs and so I had to go get it. The security didn't want him back inside. I called him an Uber on his phone and he left. I am shook.
[09/10/18, 8:14:22 PM] Sush: wtf!!
[09/10/18, 8:14:38 PM] Sush: you're home now?
[09/10/18, 8:14:40 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I'm back at the show
[09/10/18, 8:14:48 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I didn't want to leave, I paid money for this ticket
[09/10/18, 8:15:02 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And I thought maybe listening to the stories would be like healing or whatever
[09/10/18, 8:15:05 PM] Sush: oh my god! i'm so sorry this happened - that sounds so scary!!
[09/10/18, 8:15:36 PM] Pranathi Chicago: He just texted me saying "I guess that was the wrong way to ask you out"
[09/10/18, 8:15:43 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Is there something wrong with em?
[09/10/18, 8:15:44 PM] Sush: WTF
[09/10/18, 8:15:44 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Me?
[09/10/18, 8:15:48 PM] Sush: No!!
[09/10/18, 8:15:54 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Am I inviting people to touch me?
[09/10/18, 8:15:54 PM] Sush: you are PERFECT
[09/10/18, 8:16:11 PM] Pranathi Chicago: How did I get into this situation? I feel so naive and stupid :(((((
[09/10/18, 8:16:14 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And embarrassed
[09/10/18, 8:16:18 PM] Sush: this avalanche of people getting called out now also should make it so clear that it isn't about you!
[09/10/18, 8:16:21 PM] Pranathi Chicago: There are so many people here from UChicago
[09/10/18, 8:16:30 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I know it isn't. :( It just feels terrible
[09/10/18, 8:16:38 PM] Sush: It _is_ so awful!
[09/10/18, 8:16:46 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And I know I have no reason to be embarrassed, he's responsible for his own actions
[09/10/18, 8:16:51 PM] Sush: what's with all the aggression also?!
[09/10/18, 8:16:57 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I can't hold responsibility for it
[09/10/18, 8:17:04 PM] Sush: not at all
[09/10/18, 8:17:07 PM] Pranathi Chicago: But the organizers here were clearly pissed
[09/10/18, 8:17:10 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Of course
[09/10/18, 8:17:12 PM] Sush: was he on drugs or drunk or something
[09/10/18, 8:17:17 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And I felt so guilty for bringing him to this space
[09/10/18, 8:17:35 PM] Sush: he hasn't behaved like this before, you had zero way of foreseeing this!
[09/10/18, 8:17:45 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I was smoking and we've done that before and it's been fine. But I think this time he had a psychotic break
[09/10/18, 8:17:48 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I feel so guilty
[09/10/18, 8:17:52 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I shouldn't have let him smoke
[09/10/18, 8:18:12 PM] Pranathi Chicago: But again, I couldn't have known this would happen and he does it a lot. It's not like this is his first time
[09/10/18, 8:18:27 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I think he's bipolar so I think it triggered a manic episode
[09/10/18, 8:18:37 PM] Sush: it sounds like such a scary episode!!
[09/10/18, 8:18:42 PM] Pranathi Chicago: But he tells me he smokes with his friends and we've also smoked and this has never happened
[09/10/18, 8:18:44 PM] Sush: you're not his parent also
[09/10/18, 8:18:54 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And getting touched by him made me almost black out with rage
[09/10/18, 8:18:55 PM] Sush: doesn't sound like even he could have foreseen it
[09/10/18, 8:19:05 PM] Pranathi Chicago: So it was hard to act with empathy
[09/10/18, 8:19:15 PM] Sush: that is very very fair
[09/10/18, 8:19:56 PM] Sush: tell me if you want me to call you ‚ù§

Deprived of alcohol, some brahmin temple cooks thought they could get high on fermented rice. Kinda like saki. But their experiment failed. To salvage it one of them made fried crepes out of it

[16/10/18, 1:58:19 PM] Sush: it's that whole 'why did you break this glass?' vs 'why did you leave it here where it can be broken?'

[22/10/18, 12:41:42 PM] Pranathi Chicago: If the city is the theater for national politics, then the streets are its stage.
[22/10/18, 12:42:03 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Then I go on to talk about how people immolated themselves on the streets during Mandal protests
[22/10/18, 12:42:09 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Is it too cheesy?

[22/10/18, 12:51:12 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Dude this is so hard
[22/10/18, 12:51:17 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I deleted seven pages and I'm starting again
[22/10/18, 12:51:30 PM] Sush: Oh man! Why did you delete
[22/10/18, 12:52:11 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Because I realized it was a lot of blah blah without getting to my research design
[22/10/18, 12:52:23 PM] Pranathi Chicago: But also it's so hard to set context and provide research design stuff within 10 double spaced pages
[22/10/18, 12:52:30 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Especially since these fools don't know anything about caste
[22/10/18, 12:52:53 PM] Pranathi Chicago: It's so easy to just start talking about methods and design if you're doing something like "masculinity" in America. You can assume there's some shared understanding.
[22/10/18, 12:53:00 PM] Sush: True :( it really is an extra burden placed on non-America scholars no
[22/10/18, 12:53:05 PM] Sush: Yeah :/
[22/10/18, 12:53:07 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah!! It's so unfair to me.
[22/10/18, 12:53:25 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Like if I don't do context-setting, I run the risk of being taken less seriously because they just don't get the relevance of my project
[22/10/18, 12:53:38 PM] Sush: True :/
[22/10/18, 12:53:39 PM] Pranathi Chicago: But if I do, I have way less space to show them I know what I want to do and I have a research plan
[22/10/18, 12:54:03 PM] Sush: it's a little bit like in insti how we had to preface everything with 'why are SS important'
[22/10/18, 12:54:24 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Lol exactly. It's exhausting to have to constantly make a case for self
[22/10/18, 12:54:29 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Especially when running low on confidence haha
[22/10/18, 12:54:34 PM] Sush: True :(

[22/10/18, 9:25:32 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I was like ew, that's not even what I am.

[22/10/18, 9:27:26 PM] Pranathi Chicago: But he said he'd take me to go eat tacos for dinner.
[22/10/18, 9:27:38 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Which sounds decidedly non-work. But also knowing my luck he's probably gay.
[22/10/18, 9:28:28 PM] Sush: He‚Äôs cute!!
[22/10/18, 9:28:28 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Or is already dating someone who is like a Victoria's Secret model.

[23/10/18, 12:31:01 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And poke them where it hurts
[23/10/18, 12:31:17 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Like singing is such a vulnerable thing to do first of all, then to share. Just don't even say anything if you can't be nice.
[23/10/18, 12:31:28 AM] Sush: Fair :/
[23/10/18, 12:31:35 AM] Sush: Distancing is better really
[23/10/18, 12:31:44 AM] Sush: Engage superficially
[23/10/18, 12:31:52 AM] Sush: Too keep civility
[23/10/18, 12:32:02 AM] Pranathi Chicago: She does weird overtures of friendship and I got briefly bamboozled again
[23/10/18, 12:32:08 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Today she gushed about how happy she is that I'm here and all
[23/10/18, 12:32:13 AM] Sush: I totally hear ya
[23/10/18, 12:32:18 AM] Pranathi Chicago: But it's only because she's feeling distanced by those catty white women in Kristen's group
[23/10/18, 12:32:23 AM] Sush: That‚Äôs where This gets tricky
[23/10/18, 12:32:24 AM] Pranathi Chicago: So she's back to being nice.
[23/10/18, 12:32:34 AM] Sush: Very hard to negotiate

[24/10/18, 1:54:23 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And what happened? Why did you feel off?
[24/10/18, 1:55:13 PM] Sush: i can't tell from the text tbh! but take him up on that - we will gather more cues!

[27/10/18, 10:41:42 AM] Pranathi Chicago: No one would have any use for your passport to try and steal it. I'm sure it'll be around. Just give it an hour or so. Maybe you'll remember if there was some spot you chose to keep it

[16/11/18, 1:39:14 PM] Sush: Riddhima said she will confirm in the morning

[16/11/18, 1:57:07 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I had to do emails in the morning, then sexual harassment training. The irony of which nearly killed me
[16/11/18, 1:57:10 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Now doing IRB training
[16/11/18, 1:57:13 PM] Pranathi Chicago: It all feels very infuriating

[19/11/18, 3:15:28 PM] Sush: duuude
[19/11/18, 3:15:32 PM] Sush: i snapped at erin
[19/11/18, 3:15:51 PM] Sush: i was initially annoyed and i thought i'd just let it go because she's having a rough week
[19/11/18, 3:16:01 PM] Sush: because of school work
[19/11/18, 3:16:11 PM] Sush: then she caught me at a time i was VERY hungry
[19/11/18, 3:16:18 PM] Sush: and i snapped offü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄ
[19/11/18, 3:16:49 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Ayyo :(
[19/11/18, 3:16:57 PM] Pranathi Chicago: What did she do?
[19/11/18, 3:17:13 PM] Sush: first at the lab meeting she was like 'i have some thoughts on what you're doing, i'll tell you'
[19/11/18, 3:17:17 PM] Sush: like whether i asked????
[19/11/18, 3:17:55 PM] Sush: and then she wrote those thoughts down on our project management thing saying v obvious things and being like why don't you google 'event disambiguation'
[19/11/18, 3:18:20 PM] Sush: idk - i feel like for andy to see her telling me to try these obvious things (that i've already tried) makes it look like i'm slacking
[19/11/18, 3:18:55 PM] Sush: when i saw her something she was saying and i was like erin OF COURSE I GOOGLED IT
[19/11/18, 3:18:57 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah that's fair. It's definitely not flattering
[19/11/18, 3:19:15 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Caps = yelling?
[19/11/18, 3:19:17 PM] Sush: and like why are you even giving me suggestions
[19/11/18, 3:19:25 PM] Sush: i said it with an edge
[19/11/18, 3:19:35 PM] Sush: and she was like oh of course of course sorry i was being a jerk
[19/11/18, 3:19:42 PM] Sush: but wanted to say JUST IN CASE
[19/11/18, 3:19:50 PM] Sush: like, wtf
[19/11/18, 3:19:57 PM] Sush: how stupid am i? that i won't GOOGLE MY TASK?
[19/11/18, 3:20:09 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Ughhhh do you think she is wanting to impress Andy?
[19/11/18, 3:20:15 PM] Sush: maybe??
[19/11/18, 3:20:21 PM] Sush: and like, why are you telling me what to try
[19/11/18, 3:20:22 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Like acting oversmart just so he'll notice
[19/11/18, 3:20:26 PM] Sush: i never asked you
[19/11/18, 3:20:37 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah it's very undermining!
[19/11/18, 3:20:38 PM] Sush: not to pull rank, but like, this is my JOB
[19/11/18, 3:20:49 PM] Sush: you do this when your school schedule allows it
[19/11/18, 3:21:16 PM] Sush: within the structure of the lab, technically, she reports to me
[19/11/18, 3:21:25 PM] Sush: she's an intern on my project
[19/11/18, 3:21:44 PM] Pranathi Chicago: She must be super insecure about that
[19/11/18, 3:21:59 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Not that it excuses her adhikaprasangithanam
[19/11/18, 3:22:00 PM] Sush: and i don't want to play it like that - i want to be collaborative about it - but don't tell me what to do :/
[19/11/18, 3:22:20 PM] Sush: ya and like she desperately wanted the phd and she's gotten her fav program
[19/11/18, 3:22:21 PM] Sush: be happy no
[19/11/18, 3:23:23 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah I would just tell her like, didn't mean to snap but maybe don't undercut me like that at meetings
[19/11/18, 3:26:00 PM] Sush: yeah :/
[19/11/18, 3:26:10 PM] Sush: Andy will see and be like Sush didn‚Äôt google it???
[19/11/18, 3:26:15 PM] Sush: Lol
[19/11/18, 3:26:43 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Lolol I'm sure he knows you googled it
[19/11/18, 3:27:03 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Honestly this probably makes Erin look stupid more than you
[19/11/18, 3:27:47 PM] Sush: üòÖü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
[19/11/18, 3:27:53 PM] Sush: I was so hangry and irritated
[19/11/18, 3:28:07 PM] Sush: Now I ate lunch and I‚Äôm feeling less annoyed
[19/11/18, 3:28:11 PM] Sush: How are you my love

[19/11/18, 3:32:04 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I am fine!
[19/11/18, 3:32:13 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Just made myself a little snack which I shouldn't have
[19/11/18, 3:32:17 PM] Pranathi Chicago: It is basically mug cake lol
[19/11/18, 3:32:22 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Why such indulgence!
[19/11/18, 3:32:40 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I am glad you're feeling less annoyed! Your face is shining!
[19/11/18, 3:36:50 PM] Sush: That sounds delicious
[19/11/18, 3:42:24 PM] Sush: What mug cake was it?
[19/11/18, 3:51:57 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Peanut butter!
[19/11/18, 3:52:07 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I chose that one because you don't need eggs and I don't have eggs.
[19/11/18, 3:53:04 PM] Pranathi Chicago: It's super easy. Just two tbsps of peanut butter, tea tbsps of flour, one tbsp sugar, two tbsps milk (I used vanilla creamer for vanilla flavor), and a quarter tsp baking powder. Just mix it all up in a mug and stick it in the microwave for 1 minute.
[19/11/18, 3:53:08 PM] Pranathi Chicago: It was so nice with coffee.
[19/11/18, 3:53:23 PM] Sush: Yumm!!
[19/11/18, 3:53:38 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah, it's quite surprising how easy these mug cakes are.
[19/11/18, 3:53:50 PM] Sush: I‚Äôm going to make this with almond butter
[19/11/18, 3:53:58 PM] Sush: I ‚ù§Ô∏è almond butter
[19/11/18, 3:53:59 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And perfect portion size unlike this bloody country where everything is ridiculously large
[19/11/18, 3:54:00 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah make!
[19/11/18, 3:54:04 PM] Sush: Correct!
[19/11/18, 3:54:05 PM] Pranathi Chicago: That would be so nice
[19/11/18, 3:54:11 PM] Sush: I like almond butter so much
[19/11/18, 3:54:22 PM] Sush: My stupid mother loves
[19/11/18, 3:54:50 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Haha I don't think I've ever tried it tbh
[19/11/18, 3:55:01 PM] Sush: Ohh I think you‚Äôll like
[19/11/18, 3:55:13 PM] Sush: Esp if you generally like almonds
[19/11/18, 3:55:36 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I loooove almonds
[19/11/18, 3:56:02 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Actually the year I went to Nick's parents' for Christmas, we made almond marzipan cookies together to take them as a gift
[19/11/18, 3:56:12 PM] Pranathi Chicago: We put it in mason jars and tied it with twine. It was really cute
[19/11/18, 3:56:42 PM] Sush: cuuute
[19/11/18, 3:57:04 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Ofc it was all my idea. But Nick was a great companion for cooking/baking projects
[19/11/18, 3:57:19 PM] Pranathi Chicago: He was always enthu to give it a go and was actually good at cooking stuff, so I didn't have to worry about him being a buffoon in the kitchen
[19/11/18, 3:57:31 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I think it's a real turnoff to me when men are terrible at cooking or say they can't do it...
[19/11/18, 3:58:13 PM] Sush: Agreeee
[19/11/18, 3:58:33 PM] Sush: it‚Äôs almost always gendered socialisation that makes them say that
[19/11/18, 4:00:08 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Agreed
[19/11/18, 4:00:21 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Dude I am feeling like I've put on a ton of weight recently
[19/11/18, 4:00:57 PM] Sush: same :(
[19/11/18, 4:01:13 PM] Sush: I checked my weight on Sunday and cried lol Rodrigo was startled
[19/11/18, 4:01:51 PM] Sush: If it helps at all - you look ü§©
[19/11/18, 4:02:13 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Aww thank you
[19/11/18, 4:02:33 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I try not to bring it up around you because you've mentioned before that it feels triggering. But today I think I am feeling worse than usual for some reason
[19/11/18, 4:02:38 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Sorry if this is annoying :(
[19/11/18, 4:02:58 PM] Sush: No no it‚Äôs not - I can fully empathise
[19/11/18, 4:03:13 PM] Sush: the nature of winter clothes also doesn‚Äôt help that feeling AT ALL
[19/11/18, 4:03:38 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah and I checked my weight and it's gone up. Plus I spent all morning around Rebecca who was describing her eating disorder thoughts
[19/11/18, 4:04:00 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And I just felt really bad about how I've been treating my body. Not eating "healthy" or whatever plus not exercising.
[19/11/18, 4:04:42 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I don't think she meant it to throw shade on my eating/exercise habits, but it definitely felt like I was being criticized because of my own insecurity I guess.
[19/11/18, 4:04:49 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And yeah, bloody FAT ass jacket.
[19/11/18, 4:05:53 PM] Sush: That sucks man :( it‚Äôs easy to feel attacked when someone is self-hating about something you‚Äôre already stressed about
[19/11/18, 4:06:12 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah... And saying they're not doing things that I definitely don't do.
[19/11/18, 4:06:25 PM] Pranathi Chicago: She said she exercised only 4 instead of 5 times this week and I felt VERY UPSET
[19/11/18, 4:06:49 PM] Pranathi Chicago: But that's really on me, so I'm over it. I clearly made mug cake to inure myself with all that sugar lol
[19/11/18, 4:07:43 PM] Sush: hahaha
[19/11/18, 4:07:54 PM] Sush: yeah that's hard for both of you :(
[19/11/18, 4:08:46 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah, I don't blame her for it. I know that's coming from a place she can't control. But it's still hard to hear
[19/11/18, 4:08:58 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And even harder not to take personally.
[19/11/18, 4:09:18 PM] Sush: that's fair!
[19/11/18, 4:09:37 PM] Sush: what do you think will make you feel stronger / healthier in your own body?
[19/11/18, 4:11:22 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Maybe working out, but I know I shouldn't do that as a response to this stimulus. I will only do it reactively and it'll fizzle out
[19/11/18, 4:11:31 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I really want to go to dance class again when I'm back in Chennai
[19/11/18, 4:11:46 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And meanwhile maybe I should just go to the gym 2-3 times a week
[19/11/18, 4:11:49 PM] Sush: that's a great idea!
[19/11/18, 4:12:15 PM] Sush: i really think something that is FUN to us and happens to be good for the body is only sustainable
[19/11/18, 4:13:37 PM] Sush: idk if this will help - but you sounded like you were enjoying the weights stuff at the gym last year
[19/11/18, 4:14:01 PM] Pranathi Chicago: It was fun. But now I know so many people that are there all the time, like that bloody Brandon
[19/11/18, 4:14:16 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And he made some comment once about how he was laughing at someone who was using the weights incorrectly or something
[19/11/18, 4:14:20 PM] Sush: lol 2 TRUE
[19/11/18, 4:14:29 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I realized that it's made me super self conscious now to go and just mess around
[19/11/18, 4:14:37 PM] Sush: ugggh brandon you're so lame people must laugh at you all the time just walking
[19/11/18, 4:14:43 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Because I don't want people like Brandon to be thinking shit about me as I work out and feel so vulnerable
[19/11/18, 4:14:54 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah! And Brandon's probably one of the nicer gym rats.
[20/11/18, 3:11:42 PM] Pranathi Chicago: ‚ÄéMissed voice call
[20/11/18, 6:34:41 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Dude, can you call me? I am bleeding when I poop and my abdomen is hurting
[20/11/18, 6:35:00 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And I feel like I am wanting to go more than normal
[20/11/18, 6:35:08 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Do you think I have colon cancer?
[20/11/18, 6:35:12 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Or intestinal bleeding?

[27/11/18, 11:05:22 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I AM CRYING
[27/11/18, 11:05:28 AM] Sush: beautiful sentence - Like patriarchy, Brahminism is a social system that reflects not just oppression by the group at the top of the ritualistic structure (Brahmins or men), but the violence engendered by its categorical inequalities.
[27/11/18, 11:05:51 AM] Sush: hahaha ofc you are!
[27/11/18, 11:06:05 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Ugh thank you. I only put in categorical inequalities part
[27/11/18, 11:06:08 AM] Pranathi Chicago: So flattered
[27/11/18, 11:06:14 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Hahaha ey don't make fun of my tear ducts
[27/11/18, 11:06:32 AM] Sush: love how this stops JUST short of snark - Moreover, by brushing over the attempted genocide and mass extermination, the parallels between anti-Brahminism and anti-Semitism stretch beyond acceptable hyperbole.
[27/11/18, 11:06:50 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Haha that was all Liza. She's such a badass man
[27/11/18, 11:07:05 AM] Pranathi Chicago: She emailed me today saying this is the most reception she's ever had for anything she's ever written lol

[27/11/18, 11:11:11 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I am proud of my ancestors and what they did to conquer India. Then Conquest was the way of life. My parents and Original Brahmins like M. S Golwalkar call other Indians as 'Mool Nivasi'. He called Aryan was Iran and rightly so, for Iran means 'Land of Aryans' according to Iranians. Before the Aryan conquest Iranians looked like south Indians.

[03/12/18, 7:45:56 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I have an ideaaaaa
[03/12/18, 7:48:58 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Wouldn't it be interesting to see what comes up on google when you type in the name of a country? For example, type in Switzerland or Chile or Portugal, and Google tells you "things to do" in these countries. They seem to be categorized as these sexy tourist destinations with no real news of "global importance" to boast of. But if you google China or India or Turkey, Google tells you latest news items. Either they're always under scrutiny because they could be potentially problematic for the powers that be, or they're places that are newsworthy in a way that the Switzerland touristy types are not. And then if you google like, East Timor, it shows you Wikipedia first because they *expect* you to not know much about it anyway. It would be a sort of fun project to see which countries are categorized as which Google item as a reflection on geopolitics I think!
[03/12/18, 11:31:36 PM] Sush: That‚Äôs a great idea!
[04/12/18, 11:37:08 AM] Sush: hi friend

[24/12/18, 3:42:59 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I hate him so much
[24/12/18, 3:43:13 PM] Sush: Ugh I hate that you might have to see him :(

[28/12/18, 9:21:16 AM] Sush: Like, why
[28/12/18, 9:23:27 AM] Pranathi Chicago: What are they being mean about!!
[28/12/18, 9:23:31 AM] Pranathi Chicago: She's such a lovely human
[28/12/18, 9:23:47 AM] Sush: She‚Äôs gone out of her way to entertain these assholes
[28/12/18, 9:24:05 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Then what's their problem!
[28/12/18, 9:24:53 AM] Sush: Easy prey I guess idk
[28/12/18, 9:24:59 AM] Sush: Paavam!
[28/12/18, 9:25:05 AM] Sush: I want her to just not be around them
[28/12/18, 9:25:25 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Ugh disgusting
[28/12/18, 9:25:30 AM] Sush: I‚Äôm feeling bad I didn‚Äôt speak up more
[28/12/18, 9:26:17 AM] Pranathi Chicago: :(( Can you tell them something now?
[28/12/18, 9:26:22 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I'm in the middle of class reunion
[28/12/18, 9:26:27 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And I feel slightly meh
[28/12/18, 9:26:36 AM] Sush: Ayyo!
[28/12/18, 9:26:45 AM] Sush: I hope that Mukesh isn‚Äôt there
[28/12/18, 9:26:55 AM] Pranathi Chicago: No he isn't
[28/12/18, 9:27:02 AM] Pranathi Chicago: But even Swetha and Tara are being kinda mean and weird
[28/12/18, 9:27:52 AM] Sush: Like distant?
[28/12/18, 9:28:23 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Just like, being condescending about things. And nobody has asked me about fieldwork or what I do or anything yet
[28/12/18, 9:28:37 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And literally Swetha sat with her body positioned away from me the whole time
[28/12/18, 9:28:59 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Then she said something about some makeup and I asked what that was and she looked at me like I was so basic for not knowing something so obvious
[28/12/18, 9:29:02 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Just dumb shit
[28/12/18, 9:29:11 AM] Pranathi Chicago: But it adds up in these contexts I feel
[28/12/18, 9:29:58 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Cause already everyone is trying to figure out how to be around either
[28/12/18, 9:30:04 AM] Pranathi Chicago: *each other
[28/12/18, 9:30:07 AM] Sush: Uuuuggghhh
[28/12/18, 9:30:12 AM] Sush: That sounds so annoying
[28/12/18, 9:30:29 AM] Sush: Is there someone who‚Äôs an ally?
[28/12/18, 9:30:35 AM] Sush: Whom can we enlist?
[28/12/18, 9:30:38 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Manasa is sweet
[28/12/18, 9:30:45 AM] Pranathi Chicago: She is very cute and nice
[28/12/18, 9:30:54 AM] Sush: That‚Äôs a relief
[28/12/18, 9:30:54 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I felt very fondly
[28/12/18, 9:31:07 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I was trying to express affection to Swetha and she visibly pulled away and went UGH
[28/12/18, 9:31:24 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I get she's not super PDA but it was very awkward
[28/12/18, 9:31:35 AM] Sush: Ugh
[28/12/18, 9:31:58 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And I said something about some movie in Kannada and said it was good, and she goes "Ew Kannada movies"
[28/12/18, 9:32:05 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Just being really neg-y
[28/12/18, 9:32:09 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And not pleasant
[28/12/18, 9:32:32 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And that's a super uncomfortable context to be in for a reunion
[28/12/18, 9:32:45 AM] Pranathi Chicago: We aren't close enough for her to be taking these liberties I feel
[28/12/18, 9:32:55 AM] Pranathi Chicago: But maybe I'm just being overly sensitive
[28/12/18, 9:33:02 AM] Pranathi Chicago: When are coconuts leaving?
[28/12/18, 9:33:44 AM] Sush: Reunions are emotionally draining also
[28/12/18, 9:33:58 AM] Sush: So many people trying to renegotiate these equations
[28/12/18, 9:34:16 AM] Sush: It‚Äôs not the place to be randomly rude
[28/12/18, 9:34:33 AM] Sush: I hate this idea also that it‚Äôs ok to be rude to ‚Äòclose‚Äô people
[28/12/18, 9:35:18 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah for sure. I tripped or something and she goes "What are you even doing?!"
[28/12/18, 9:35:32 AM] Pranathi Chicago: It was so aggro for no real reason and it was so weird
[28/12/18, 9:35:38 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I also hate that idea!
[28/12/18, 9:35:44 AM] Pranathi Chicago: What you did today?
[28/12/18, 9:36:48 AM] Sush: I took my cousin shopping
[28/12/18, 9:36:54 AM] Sush: and coconuts arrived
[28/12/18, 9:37:02 AM] Sush: They‚Äôve been coconuting
[28/12/18, 9:37:13 AM] Sush: My cousin Deepak and his daughter are sweethearts
[28/12/18, 9:37:30 AM] Sush: She calls me chittu buaüòç she‚Äôs a precious little thing
[28/12/18, 9:38:47 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Awww that's so cute!!

[29/12/18, 10:47:43 PM] Sush: my cousin and his daughter are here till 2nd tho
[29/12/18, 10:47:46 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I'm good! Just some anxiety over not doing enough, not getting enough material for fieldwork stuff. But also it's been less than three weeks, so trying not to beat myself up.
[29/12/18, 10:47:46 PM] Sush: but they're sweet
[29/12/18, 10:48:28 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I was supposed to go to some panel discussion this morning by Swarnamalya, but it was in T. Nagar at 9 and I ended up sleeping in. So feel a little annoyed at myself for that...
[29/12/18, 10:48:44 PM] Sush: ayyo! you've been running so hard this month
[29/12/18, 10:48:57 PM] Pranathi Chicago: But whatever. I keep feeling FOMO but there's no way I can possibly attend the million things going on all at once.
[29/12/18, 10:49:11 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah, trying to go easy on myself. It's hard especially without a vehicle in the city
[29/12/18, 10:49:22 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Aww. The daughter is the one that calls you chitthi bua?
[29/12/18, 10:49:23 PM] Sush: true! you can literally only be in one place at a time also
[29/12/18, 10:49:29 PM] Sush: chittu bua!

[29/12/18, 10:51:07 PM] Sush: we need to make plan
[29/12/18, 10:51:15 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Well there are times when I'm not in any place but my bed also, but I guess those moments of downtime also are necessary
[29/12/18, 10:51:25 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I miss you too! It's been forever since we spoke I feel :(
[29/12/18, 10:51:42 PM] Sush: for sure - esp because you have to engage so much!
[29/12/18, 10:51:45 PM] Sush: how to recharge
[29/12/18, 10:51:53 PM] Sush: it HAS been forever -_-
[29/12/18, 10:52:03 PM] Sush: my house has been bursting at its seams
[29/12/18, 10:52:15 PM] Sush: dude my cousin asked my father for coconut oil
[29/12/18, 10:52:18 PM] Sush: he burst out laughing
[29/12/18, 10:52:33 PM] Sush: 'coconut oil! srikant ku coconut, i mean coconut oil!'
[29/12/18, 10:52:50 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah that's why I also figured we'd talk when things calm down a little for you too. So much family time! Must have been exhausting to deal with those mean coconut cousins that were rude to your sister.
[29/12/18, 10:52:53 PM] Pranathi Chicago: HAHAHA.
[29/12/18, 10:53:07 PM] Pranathi Chicago: OMG. Does Srikant understand the coconut moniker?
[29/12/18, 10:53:16 PM] Sush: üòÇüòÇ idk!
[29/12/18, 10:53:29 PM] Sush: but he wouldn't think it applies to him because him, brown outside? what?
[29/12/18, 10:53:47 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Lololol
[29/12/18, 10:54:32 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Coconut reunion sounds damn stressful
[29/12/18, 10:54:40 PM] Sush: very annoying
[29/12/18, 10:54:45 PM] Pranathi Chicago: What are you doing for New Year's Eve?
[29/12/18, 10:54:48 PM] Sush: and i was so jet-lagged also
[29/12/18, 10:55:14 PM] Sush: just chilling at home i think - my dad is paranoid about safety on the streets on NYE and i think he's passed it on to us lol
[29/12/18, 10:55:18 PM] Sush: Nee?

[30/12/18, 11:37:08 PM] Sush: he used to be corrupt
[30/12/18, 11:37:57 PM] Sush: then a woman he considers a 'sister' gets raped and murdered
[30/12/18, 11:38:02 PM] Sush: then he turns it around

[01/01/19, 9:06:10 AM] Sush: Mr. Grumps got more grumps at all the mess
[01/01/19, 9:06:30 AM] Pranathi Chicago: That's so cool! Lol at Mr. Grumps
[01/01/19, 9:06:42 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Show candles

[02/01/19, 1:47:15 AM] Sush: I‚Äôm out!
[02/01/19, 1:47:14 AM] Pranathi Chicago: On my Indian number
[02/01/19, 1:47:28 AM] Sush: Otherwise wifi would have been good
[02/01/19, 1:47:36 AM] Sush: On my way to lunch
[02/01/19, 1:47:37 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Ohhh now I'm understanding
[02/01/19, 1:47:38 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Ok ok
[02/01/19, 1:47:50 AM] Sush: Yaa even yesterday I was on the road :P
[02/01/19, 1:47:43 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Want to just do T-Mobile then?
[02/01/19, 1:47:52 AM] Pranathi Chicago: We'll do kyook call!
[02/01/19, 1:47:57 AM] Sush: Haan!
[02/01/19, 1:48:10 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Okay hold on
[02/01/19, 1:48:48 AM] Pranathi Chicago: It's not going through. You try calling me?
[02/01/19, 2:02:11 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Sorry. My mom is super pissed at me too
[02/01/19, 2:02:17 AM] Pranathi Chicago: She thinks I have an attitude problem it seems
[02/01/19, 2:02:23 AM] Sush: ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
[02/01/19, 2:02:45 AM] Pranathi Chicago: She and I argued today because she got annoyed at my tone. Something I said that sounded rude it seems
[02/01/19, 2:02:51 AM] Pranathi Chicago: So she chased me down the hall to make me apologize
[02/01/19, 2:02:55 AM] Sush: Ayyo!
[02/01/19, 2:03:08 AM] Pranathi Chicago: It's exhausting being around them all the time
[02/01/19, 2:03:12 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And they're all like the opposite of chill
[02/01/19, 2:03:14 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Even my brother
[02/01/19, 2:03:21 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Being so fucking sanctimonious all the time
[02/01/19, 2:03:32 AM] Sush: So annoying that your brother defended that rando!
[02/01/19, 2:03:52 AM] Pranathi Chicago: He's trying to hold me accountable for getting annoyed at some random stranger's condescending questions!
[02/01/19, 2:04:03 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Why the fuck does he even care?
[02/01/19, 2:04:24 AM] Sush: Men simply don‚Äôt comprehend the irritation of being condescended to all the damn time
[02/01/19, 2:04:34 AM] Pranathi Chicago: There's this sentiment in my family that I'm the sort of brash, aggressive, asshole of a human that needs to be chastised for bad behavior
[02/01/19, 2:04:50 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And if it's not bad enough that my parents do it, my brother thinks he can take on the mantle of correcting my behavior
[02/01/19, 2:04:51 AM] Pranathi Chicago: It infuriates me
[02/01/19, 2:05:10 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah!! He doesn't know what that feels like because he's probably the one doing the condescending most of the time
[02/01/19, 2:05:54 AM] Sush: Not even unlikely
[02/01/19, 2:06:22 AM] Sush: I don‚Äôt know where to draw that line also
[02/01/19, 2:06:57 AM] Pranathi Chicago: What line?
[02/01/19, 2:07:03 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah he's gotten so uncle
[02/01/19, 2:07:05 AM] Sush: Like sometimes I feel if a social situation is about my parents
[02/01/19, 2:07:28 AM] Sush: Am I supposed to suck it up for them or am I allowed to respond authentically
[02/01/19, 2:09:18 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah it's interesting. I don't think I'm allowed to respond authentically tbh
[02/01/19, 2:09:24 AM] Pranathi Chicago: It would just drive us too far apart
[02/01/19, 2:09:34 AM] Sush: Yeah idk
[02/01/19, 2:09:45 AM] Sush: With family situations I feel entitled to respond
[02/01/19, 2:09:49 AM] Sush: Because it‚Äôs my family
[02/01/19, 2:09:52 AM] Sush: Not theirs also
[02/01/19, 2:09:56 AM] Sush: *theirs alone
[02/01/19, 2:10:43 AM] Sush: and like, we have repeated contact with family
[02/01/19, 2:11:34 AM] Sush: But these asshole boys get to come and antagonise us repeatedly and walk away happily
[02/01/19, 2:12:07 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah true
[02/01/19, 2:12:39 AM] Pranathi Chicago: True
[02/01/19, 2:13:03 AM] Pranathi Chicago: My brother and I had a conversation last week
[02/01/19, 2:13:10 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I can't remember if I told you, but I told him why he was upsetting me
[02/01/19, 2:13:29 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And I had to frame it in a way that didn't offend his ego, and tiptoe around his dumbass masculinity
[02/01/19, 2:13:38 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And he took it okaaay. But it's exhausting to do that work also
[02/01/19, 2:14:27 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I want to because I care about him and I don't want him to turn out like every other male moron
[02/01/19, 2:14:42 AM] Sush: Fair
[02/01/19, 2:14:54 AM] Sush: That careful framing is so annoying lol
[02/01/19, 2:15:01 AM] Sush: But glad he took it ok!
[02/01/19, 2:16:16 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah. It took some time, but we got there
[02/01/19, 2:16:26 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I can't do this every time he exhibits prototypical male behavior though
[02/01/19, 2:16:30 AM] Pranathi Chicago: There aren't enough hours in the day
[02/01/19, 2:16:39 AM] Pranathi Chicago: He was mansplaining soooo much to be about Carnatic music
[02/01/19, 2:16:55 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Now every time I hear him speak about some kutcheri he went to, I have to walk away for my own sanity and for the sake of my research
[02/01/19, 2:18:12 AM] Sush: That is exhausting!
[02/01/19, 2:18:43 AM] Sush: I blame my dad like that for anything literally about indian politics triggering mine and my sister‚Äôs anxiety
[02/01/19, 2:19:10 AM] Sush: ‚ÄòModi should get leprosy‚Äô is the new refrain
[02/01/19, 2:19:50 AM] Sush: Raafia is sooo late
[02/01/19, 2:20:01 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Omg you're still waiting?
[02/01/19, 2:20:03 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Ayyooo
[02/01/19, 2:20:06 AM] Sush: Yaaaa
[02/01/19, 2:20:10 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Is it a lunch date?
[02/01/19, 2:20:15 AM] Sush: Yep!
[02/01/19, 2:20:17 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Modi should get leprosy lolol WHY
[02/01/19, 2:20:20 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Why so hateful!
[02/01/19, 2:20:25 AM] Sush: Seriously!
[02/01/19, 2:20:29 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Of all things, leprosy that too hahaha
[02/01/19, 2:20:36 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Like that's a very specific curse
[02/01/19, 2:21:04 AM] Sush: Ya!!
[02/01/19, 2:21:11 AM] Sush: My dad is very scared of skin issues
[02/01/19, 2:21:18 AM] Sush: ‚ÄòAyyo sori Varun‚Äôs
[02/01/19, 2:21:23 AM] Sush: *varum
[02/01/19, 2:21:24 AM] Sush: Lol
‚Äé[02/01/19, 2:21:35 AM] Sush: ‚Äéimage omitted
[02/01/19, 2:22:39 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Hahahaha
[02/01/19, 2:22:55 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Is he also hypochondriac
[02/01/19, 2:24:06 AM] Sush: My sister is
[02/01/19, 2:24:34 AM] Sush: She is convinced her fungal infection is leprosy
[02/01/19, 2:24:43 AM] Sush: This leprosy obsession idk
[02/01/19, 2:24:46 AM] Sush: Both of them
[02/01/19, 2:25:03 AM] Sush: Once one man was begging and he touched her arm
[02/01/19, 2:25:13 AM] Sush: His fingers were malformed or something
[02/01/19, 2:25:20 AM] Sush: She was convinced he gave her leprosy
[02/01/19, 2:25:39 AM] Sush: And came home and bawled
[02/01/19, 2:25:40 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Hahaha oh nooooo
[02/01/19, 2:25:48 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I would sort of be the same way
[02/01/19, 2:25:50 AM] Pranathi Chicago: You know this
[02/01/19, 2:25:59 AM] Sush: I know I told her üòÖüòÖ
[02/01/19, 2:26:34 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I googled "how do you get leprosy"
[02/01/19, 2:26:42 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And Google suggested "how do you get leprosy from an armadillo"
[02/01/19, 2:26:44 AM] Sush: NoooüòÇ
[02/01/19, 2:26:46 AM] Sush: Omg
[02/01/19, 2:26:50 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Apparently half of the armadillos carry leprosy!
[02/01/19, 2:27:00 AM] Sush: Weird things!
[02/01/19, 2:27:02 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Amazonian armadillos jk
[02/01/19, 2:27:10 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Guess which animal I'm avoiding
[02/01/19, 2:27:17 AM] Sush: üòÇüòÇ
[02/01/19, 2:27:17 AM] Pranathi Chicago: This is why it is best to avoid unknown animals I feel
[02/01/19, 2:27:20 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And known animals also
[02/01/19, 2:27:31 AM] Sush: Correct just all animals
[02/01/19, 2:27:52 AM] Pranathi Chicago: she has arrived?
[02/01/19, 2:28:02 AM] Sush: Noü§¨

[02/01/19, 2:29:30 AM] Pranathi Chicago: You were supposed to meet at 1:30?
[02/01/19, 2:30:22 AM] Sush: Yeah!
[02/01/19, 2:30:49 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Uh oh did she text saying she's on her way?
[02/01/19, 2:31:05 AM] Sush: Ya child care delays
[02/01/19, 2:32:53 AM] Sush: What is this full tablet menu trend
[02/01/19, 2:33:41 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I just snuck into this kitchen and ate a kaju katli
[02/01/19, 2:33:43 AM] Pranathi Chicago: What tablet?
[02/01/19, 2:33:49 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Like ipad level situation?
[02/01/19, 2:34:39 AM] Pranathi Chicago: OMG
[02/01/19, 2:34:45 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Damini Gandham married Ninad Shahane?!
[02/01/19, 2:34:50 AM] Pranathi Chicago: HOW?!
[02/01/19, 4:06:26 AM] Sush: WhaAat
[02/01/19, 4:06:31 AM] Sush: Sorry
[02/01/19, 4:06:58 AM] Sush: Raafia and baby arrived
[02/01/19, 4:07:11 AM] Sush: who is Ninad shahane???
[02/01/19, 4:08:05 AM] Sush: Also the waiter at sigree gave me his phone number on a chit!!!
[02/01/19, 4:08:11 AM] Sush: Like, wtf.
[02/01/19, 4:08:29 AM] Sush: Is it classist of me to see that as v different from piccolo mondo???
[02/01/19, 4:08:42 AM] Sush: But v different culture!!!
[02/01/19, 4:11:22 AM] Sush: Ammu ate a handful of saunf and threw up alsoü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
[02/01/19, 4:14:47 AM] Sush: Ammu is Raafia‚Äôs daughter
[02/01/19, 4:28:26 AM] Pranathi Chicago: He is one fellow
[02/01/19, 4:28:39 AM] Pranathi Chicago: You google him, or look at Damini's photos on Facebook
[02/01/19, 4:30:12 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And maybe a little, but also not wrong to not feel great about it! Plus with Piccolo Mondo guy you reached out to him first which feels less threatening somehow. Particularly because in this context we've always been socialized to shun unwanted advances from men
[02/01/19, 4:31:01 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Oh noooo hahaha what a silly goose. Do you feel affectionately towards Ammu?
[02/01/19, 4:31:41 AM] Sush: that's true!
[02/01/19, 4:32:22 AM] Sush: will go home and google!
[02/01/19, 4:33:23 AM] Sush: i felt very irritated by it
[02/01/19, 4:33:30 AM] Sush: i didn't say thank you while leaving
[02/01/19, 4:35:02 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Naturally. There's something off putting about it when you have to continue to be around him also
[02/01/19, 4:35:13 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Like I don't want you to serve me after you've hit on me
[02/01/19, 4:35:15 AM] Pranathi Chicago: How awkward
[02/01/19, 4:36:15 AM] Sush: yaaa!
[02/01/19, 8:38:07 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I'm at one place called Pumpkin Tales in Alwarpet
[02/01/19, 8:38:19 AM] Pranathi Chicago: It is so fancy
[02/01/19, 8:38:29 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Chennai has so so many new places to eat at
[03/01/19, 12:27:17 AM] Pranathi Chicago: ‚ÄéMissed voice call

[03/01/19, 5:31:36 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I called because I wanted to check in about Hyderabad plans. I'm starting to schedule interviews plus there are some events I can't miss, so I wanted to ask if you're still up for it, whether I should book tickets etc.
[03/01/19, 5:34:19 AM] Sush: Helloo! I‚Äôll call in twenty?
[03/01/19, 5:34:39 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Okay. I'll be leaving soon after for a kutcheri so I won't be able to talk for long!
[03/01/19, 5:34:45 AM] Pranathi Chicago: But yes, 20 sounds good
[03/01/19, 5:34:46 AM] Pranathi Chicago: :)
[03/01/19, 5:34:49 AM] Sush: üíïüòò
[03/01/19, 5:34:59 AM] Pranathi Chicago: ‚ù§
[03/01/19, 5:51:48 AM] Sush: Friend
[03/01/19, 5:51:56 AM] Sush: Would Pongal time work for you?
[03/01/19, 5:51:57 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yesss
[03/01/19, 5:52:13 AM] Sush: I‚Äôm going to thanjavur for a day and working from home this week üò≠üò≠
[03/01/19, 5:52:39 AM] Sush: But Pongal time my cousin will be there as well - he‚Äôs great but we won‚Äôt have as much alone time :(
[03/01/19, 5:53:03 AM] Sush: This trip has been so chaotic - im sorry I‚Äôve been so bad with planning!
[03/01/19, 5:53:07 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I think I will have to be here for Pongal. :(
[03/01/19, 5:53:27 AM] Pranathi Chicago: It's the first time I've been here since I've left no?
[03/01/19, 5:53:54 AM] Sush: Makes sense that‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt ask before examining every other date ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
[03/01/19, 5:53:59 AM] Pranathi Chicago: So I think parents will get senti if I go away for Pongal. Especially with puja and visitors at home to the koil and all, I think they'll appreciate the help
[03/01/19, 5:54:14 AM] Sush: Fair fair
[03/01/19, 5:54:14 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Maybe we wait till Chicago then? ‚ù§
[03/01/19, 5:54:19 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I understand this trip has been chaotic!
[03/01/19, 5:54:23 AM] Sush: Uuuugh I miss you so much tho
[03/01/19, 5:54:25 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And I don't want to be another claimant on your time
[03/01/19, 5:54:35 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Esp since you have such limited time here with family
[03/01/19, 5:54:38 AM] Sush: I feel irritated that I had to hang with randos in Hyd instead of you
[03/01/19, 5:54:41 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I miss you tooooo
[03/01/19, 5:54:48 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Soooooo much

[13/01/19, 1:47:07 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Ugh that sounds very messy!!
[13/01/19, 1:47:31 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I hope they eventually get over it, but it sucks your mom is upset. :(
[13/01/19, 1:47:38 AM] Pranathi Chicago: How's your dad?
[13/01/19, 1:47:49 AM] Sush: Yeah :( i feel a little guilty also
[13/01/19, 1:47:58 AM] Sush: You think I was selfish?
[13/01/19, 1:48:24 AM] Sush: Old people are saying they want to come visit me and I turned them away
[13/01/19, 1:49:23 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Btw remember that book we saw? Daughters of the Sun by Ira Mukhoty about Mughal royal women? I'm at a panel and she's saying very interesting things!
[13/01/19, 1:49:37 AM] Pranathi Chicago: No I don't think you were selfish at all
[13/01/19, 1:49:44 AM] Sush: Oooh yes! Did you get the book?
[13/01/19, 1:49:50 AM] Pranathi Chicago: You're not selfish to want to be around your immediate family
[13/01/19, 1:49:59 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I am going to get the book!
[13/01/19, 1:50:18 AM] Sush: V cool!
[13/01/19, 1:50:32 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And maybe the lying is just complicated, but that was also to spare their feelings. So don't feel too guilty!
[13/01/19, 1:50:50 AM] Sush: I think they kinda saw through it
[13/01/19, 1:51:03 AM] Sush: Because they came home that day and no one was there
[13/01/19, 1:51:14 AM] Sush: and now also my parents are saying dumb lies
[13/01/19, 1:51:16 AM] Sush: Ugh
[13/01/19, 1:51:26 AM] Sush: I‚Äôm also resentful that I‚Äôm losing time to this!
[13/01/19, 1:52:34 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Oh noooo. Maybe that day you should've asked Sneha to come lol
[13/01/19, 1:53:18 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah I guess now it's too late to take back the lie also :(
[13/01/19, 1:53:54 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Don't be too sad lovebug. You can't keep everyone happy also
[13/01/19, 2:17:18 AM] Sush: Lol yaa
[13/01/19, 2:17:30 AM] Sush: I think mom is also slightly resentful
[13/01/19, 2:17:34 AM] Sush: Which annoys me a bit
[13/01/19, 2:17:47 AM] Sush: Like she‚Äôs saying ammo akka would have thrown a tantrum
[13/01/19, 2:18:06 AM] Sush: Which completes erases the way my uncle treats my sister
[13/01/19, 2:18:30 AM] Sush: that‚Äôs not fair no?
[13/01/19, 2:18:54 AM] Sush: It‚Äôs gaslighting to say you will throw tantrum if a person who actively causes you harm continues to cause you harm
[13/01/19, 8:24:42 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah it's definitely not fair :(
[13/01/19, 8:24:45 AM] Pranathi Chicago: That breaks my heart
[13/01/19, 8:25:25 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I think maybe your mom doesn't want to acknowledge it because then it would bring up all the guilt and worry and anger that she probably can't deal with retrospectively
[13/01/19, 8:25:37 AM] Pranathi Chicago: It would be world view shattering for her to see people in her own family that way
[13/01/19, 8:25:50 AM] Pranathi Chicago: But I totally get your annoyance too.
[13/01/19, 8:25:55 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Sorry for the late response

[17/01/19, 10:51:03 AM] Sush: Ohmygosh! What happened?
[17/01/19, 10:52:07 AM] Pranathi Chicago: This guy who's a Tamil Muslim filmmaker
[17/01/19, 10:52:21 AM] Pranathi Chicago: He basically told me I need to unlearn all my Brahminness if I can even hope to do this research on gaana
[17/01/19, 10:52:30 AM] Pranathi Chicago: He told me I need to change the way I speak, and he said it's a pity I'm fair, because it'll give me away.
[17/01/19, 10:52:38 AM] Pranathi Chicago: He also gave me a bunch of "tips" like "dress more modestly". (I was wearing pants and a shirt today to go to Amethyst.)
[17/01/19, 10:52:57 AM] Pranathi Chicago: He gave me "primers" like "don't say 'avaa', say 'avanga'." As though I don't know...
[17/01/19, 10:53:17 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And basically made a lot of assumptions about how I would act... And told me I should expect people to treat me like "a Brahmin bitch".
[17/01/19, 10:53:45 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And that I should ask for forgiveness where possible...
[17/01/19, 11:00:31 AM] Sush: Oh my god!
[17/01/19, 11:00:35 AM] Sush: That sounds awful!!!
[17/01/19, 11:00:43 AM] Sush: I‚Äôm so sorry you had to listen to all that!
[17/01/19, 11:01:03 AM] Sush: Wtf
[17/01/19, 11:01:08 AM] Pranathi Chicago: It feels really discouraging and painful
[17/01/19, 11:01:15 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I try to be as reflexive as possible
[17/01/19, 11:01:20 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And I think seriously about my positionality
[17/01/19, 11:01:35 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I'm trying to make sure I don't rub anyone the wrong way or be oblivious to my privilege
[17/01/19, 11:01:45 AM] Pranathi Chicago: But I honestly don't know if "asking for forgiveness" is the way to go forward
[17/01/19, 11:02:18 AM] Sush: It‚Äôs almost like he‚Äôs asking you be self loathing
[17/01/19, 11:02:21 AM] Sush: No need uncle
[17/01/19, 11:14:53 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah exactly
[17/01/19, 11:14:58 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And it's also disingenuous
[17/01/19, 11:15:01 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Anyway...
[17/01/19, 11:15:14 AM] Pranathi Chicago: How are you making the most of your time at home?

[21/02/19, 2:08:36 PM] Pranathi Chicago: *and all
[21/02/19, 2:08:45 PM] Sush: True!
[21/02/19, 2:08:49 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Plus in two years who knows where I'll be
[21/02/19, 2:08:54 PM] Sush: correct
[22/02/19, 8:43:28 AM] Pranathi Chicago: So it's not a meniscus tear, but it is a "moderate" ligament sprain. It's not bad enough to require surgery, but it is distressed enough to mean I have to wear this brace for another two weeks at least. I can go out and stuff, but I shouldn't walk around too much and put pressure on my knee.
[22/02/19, 3:25:55 PM] Sush: Paavam!!
[22/02/19, 3:26:07 PM] Sush: I hope the pain isn't too bad?
[22/02/19, 8:25:14 PM] Pranathi Chicago: No it's not too bad
[22/02/19, 8:25:32 PM] Pranathi Chicago: More of an annoyance that I have to wear this brace for two weeks. It severely hampers movement
[22/02/19, 8:25:39 PM] Pranathi Chicago: So I can go out but I can't walk around much
[22/02/19, 10:51:04 PM] Sush: ayyo!
[22/02/19, 10:51:13 PM] Sush: glad it's not too painful though!
[24/02/19, 10:13:41 PM] Sush: how is your knee?

[11/03/19, 12:51:54 PM] Pranathi Chicago: He was acting so stressed out thinking his friends know or have guessed or something. And I was just a little annoyed about the drama
[11/03/19, 12:52:11 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Like so what if they know? I mean what could they know? It's not like we've done anything more than talk
[11/03/19, 12:52:32 PM] Sush: fair! Not like there‚Äôs anything major for other people to know also - you‚Äôre just talking no
[11/03/19, 12:52:47 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And he kept saying oh I don't want them to know, what if they say something about you and that makes me feel weird about meeting you
[11/03/19, 12:53:11 PM] Pranathi Chicago: That was weird because I was like hmm, what is a dealbreaker? And why do you care what people I haven't met in ten years since school would have to say about me

[11/03/19, 12:57:37 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I said I'm going to meet one guy, and he didn't stop at saying be safe, which itself was disproved soooo much because this guy I met there and his family were so so lovely to me
[11/03/19, 12:57:55 PM] Pranathi Chicago: But even with the warning he could've stopped. He *wanted* me to take pepper spray or some guy with me
[11/03/19, 12:58:05 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And I just didn't want to hear random advice on how to do my research

[11/03/19, 1:01:35 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And he was like, I know but just be careful. You don't know how they'll see you or what they could do
[11/03/19, 1:02:20 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I said I don't like walking around the world thinking people are going to attack me in broad daylight. Especially because he was like oh, North Madras you have to be careful
[11/03/19, 1:02:33 PM] Pranathi Chicago: It's so casteist and classist

[07/04/19, 10:20:29 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Wow yeah I can't imagine having that kind of guilt also
[07/04/19, 10:20:46 PM] Sush: i suddenly heard the word ‚Äòadultery‚Äô in my head and freaked out slightly
[07/04/19, 10:21:00 PM] Sush: I mentioned it to Siddhartha yday when we talked

[07/04/19, 10:25:45 PM] Sush: Lolol
[07/04/19, 10:25:47 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I basically rolled my eyes
[07/04/19, 10:25:53 PM] Pranathi Chicago: He doesn't want to meet
[07/04/19, 10:26:05 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Because he thinks it'll complicate the situation and he'll fall for me it seems
[07/04/19, 10:26:17 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I was like ya ya k whatevs tc bye
[07/04/19, 10:26:22 PM] Sush: How to tell someone don‚Äôt worry I‚Äôm not falling for u
[07/04/19, 10:26:26 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I'm paraphrasing but
[07/04/19, 10:26:37 PM] Pranathi Chicago: lol yeah how to say don't be so presumptuous
[07/04/19, 10:26:45 PM] Sush: correct
[07/04/19, 10:27:00 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Then Tejas called and said he will come next weekend
[07/04/19, 10:27:04 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And I said please don't
[07/04/19, 10:27:09 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Or two weekends from now
[07/04/19, 10:27:13 PM] Sush: Omg!!
[07/04/19, 10:27:15 PM] Sush: Why not
[07/04/19, 10:27:21 PM] Sush: It‚Äôll help you figure out no
[07/04/19, 10:27:33 PM] Sush: and then you can chill in sf depending
[07/04/19, 10:27:40 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah but I'm worried about him being too intense
[07/04/19, 10:28:02 PM] Sush: I wonder if you‚Äôll feel more in control in your space?
[07/04/19, 10:28:05 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Already it seems like this is why he wants to come. He's freaking out about the conversation we had I think
[07/04/19, 10:28:14 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Ooh this is true.
[07/04/19, 10:28:31 PM] Sush: but also maybe more obligated?
[07/04/19, 10:28:46 PM] Sush: Engendho he‚Äôs come means
[07/04/19, 10:29:03 PM] Pranathi Chicago: But next weekend is too close he says. And the weekend after that is maybe Cleveland, but also may not go. Then the weekend after that is the weekend right before I go
[07/04/19, 10:29:19 PM] Sush: Ohhh fair
[07/04/19, 10:29:30 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah. This month is actually really busy with work and I don't know if I have the energy to hang out for two whole days and figure out how I feel and all
[07/04/19, 10:29:44 PM] Sush: That makes a lot of sense
[07/04/19, 10:29:43 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Even if I have the time, I feel like this situation is so so so much energy
[07/04/19, 10:30:01 PM] Sush: plus if it‚Äôs at his space you can LEAVE
[07/04/19, 10:30:15 PM] Sush: but you can‚Äôt kick him out if things don‚Äôt go well
[07/04/19, 10:30:25 PM] Pranathi Chicago: He called this evening and he was just so annoyingly upbeat and I've been feeling massive Monday blues. So I had to tell him I'll talk tomorrow and I might just need this evening to be quiet and chill
[07/04/19, 10:30:43 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And he goes "But I have 30 mins free now"
[07/04/19, 10:30:54 PM] Sush: ayyo why he‚Äôs not hearing u
[07/04/19, 10:30:56 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah exactly
[07/04/19, 10:31:13 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Then he sent me pictures of puppies to cheer me up and said he'd send some every hour
[07/04/19, 10:31:21 PM] Sush: omg
[07/04/19, 10:31:26 PM] Sush: has he literally met u
[07/04/19, 10:31:32 PM] Pranathi Chicago: He said you don't have to apologize for not responding, but he wants to cheer me up
[07/04/19, 10:31:40 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Literally no
[07/04/19, 10:31:48 PM] Sush: ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
[07/04/19, 10:31:50 PM] Pranathi Chicago: He has no clue who I am tho
[07/04/19, 10:32:07 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And doesn't give a shit what I'm literally going on about
[07/04/19, 10:32:17 PM] Pranathi Chicago: ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄ
[07/04/19, 10:32:27 PM] Sush: Ayyo :/
[07/04/19, 10:32:49 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I think I just have to deescalate so that I don't feel annoyed when I meet him
[07/04/19, 10:33:09 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I think this talking less, like maybe once every couple days instead of every couple of hours
[07/04/19, 10:33:13 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Might be one way
[07/04/19, 10:33:22 PM] Sush: correct
[07/04/19, 10:33:32 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Anyway, I haz to sleep soon and men are so bore

[07/04/19, 10:35:26 PM] Sush: and the nature of these things is like someone needs my outputs next week
[07/04/19, 10:35:28 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Especially since you worked today
[07/04/19, 10:35:47 PM] Sush: Ya but he doesn‚Äôt know that haha he will just see unfinished tasks from last week
[07/04/19, 10:35:56 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Ugh that sounds stressful
[07/04/19, 10:36:28 PM] Pranathi Chicago: But I have confidence in yew, and let me know if you want to do a work date at any point
[07/04/19, 10:36:31 PM] Sush: I mean it‚Äôs ok I really did slack off a lot and I‚Äôm lucky I can catch up - a lot of jobs have shorter turnaround times
[07/04/19, 10:36:42 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I also feel very stressed about the stuff I have to do this month

[07/04/19, 10:40:20 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Thank you, and good luck to you too! Have a great week ahead love
[07/04/19, 10:40:31 PM] Sush: üòòüòò
[07/04/19, 10:40:33 PM] Pranathi Chicago: üå∏üå∫üçÉ
[08/04/19, 11:38:35 AM] Sush: 'it was amazing to see Pranathi also! she‚Äôs really grown into herself over doing fieldwork in the last few months and is so so brave and forthright and aware knowledgable of herself and her work!!'
[08/04/19, 12:31:32 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Awwww
[08/04/19, 12:31:36 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Who is thissssss
[08/04/19, 12:31:39 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Oviya?

[08/04/19, 12:32:31 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Free to talk?
[08/04/19, 12:32:51 PM] Sush: in 2 mins?
[08/04/19, 12:32:55 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yessss
[08/04/19, 12:32:58 PM] Sush: going to heat up lunch
[08/04/19, 12:33:23 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I am walking to Roti for lunch
[08/04/19, 12:33:39 PM] Sush: UGH TAKE ME BACK TO HP
[08/04/19, 3:38:38 PM] Sush: all ok friend?
[08/04/19, 3:38:44 PM] Sush: i figured your phone died
[08/04/19, 3:38:51 PM] Sush: but slightly worried now
‚Äé[08/04/19, 7:22:14 PM] Pranathi Chicago: ‚Äéimage omitted
[08/04/19, 8:19:33 PM] Pranathi Chicago: ‚ÄéMissed voice call
[08/04/19, 8:20:31 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Hi! Are you able to reach me? I feel like my phone is being weird
[09/04/19, 1:11:14 PM] Sush: Hey, I was thinking about our conversation and I can't stop feeling annoyed. You could've stopped with saying you're disillusioned about marriage relationships men or whatever. I don't care about discussing the institution of marriage and I'm perfectly capable of critical thinking about my choices without needing to discuss it with you.  Honestly no one makes me have a conversation like this on their terms. 

You knew enough to say something seemingly self aware like "I shouldn't be talking to you about this". That's not the point- you shouldn't be making this about me when it's about your situation. 

But most of all it's not okay that you went on to insist on talking about how "nobody is above doing this". I don't know why you think it's ok to make me put my relationship through the very narrow and specific lens that you came up with for yourself. I'm glad none of this bothers me the way it would've if we were closer. But that doesn't change the fact that it's not done. 

For comparison- I do not believe in this even 1% but if I were to come to you and say "hey Sush isn't it kind of weird to be in any kind of casual relationship? I know I shouldn't be talking to you about this but you know...and well you can't deny that it is pretty meaningless after a point" Would it be a neutral intellectual discussion? I don't think we'd be exaggerating by calling it twisted af. 

Hope you see my point.
[09/04/19, 1:11:22 PM] Sush: Oviya
[09/04/19, 1:11:37 PM] Sush: Sorry should have led with that
[09/04/19, 1:11:48 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Oh shit
[09/04/19, 1:11:51 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I thought you were saying this to me
[09/04/19, 1:12:07 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And I felt my stomach clench with panic because I couldn't remember this conversation
‚Äé[09/04/19, 1:35:59 PM] Sush: ‚Äéimage omitted
[09/04/19, 1:42:48 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Hahaha yeah exactly
[09/04/19, 1:42:58 PM] Pranathi Chicago: The devil is definitely waiting to pounce
[09/04/19, 1:44:29 PM] Sush: Like what is this :/
[09/04/19, 1:44:38 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Too fucking much
[09/04/19, 1:44:54 PM] Sush: What is honestly no one makes me have a conversation like this on their terms
[09/04/19, 1:45:37 PM] Pranathi Chicago: What does that even mean?!
[09/04/19, 1:45:43 PM] Sush: I have no clue
[09/04/19, 1:45:49 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I don't understand what she's saying only
[09/04/19, 1:45:54 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I'm so confused by what she's mad at exactly
[09/04/19, 1:47:23 PM] Sush: I bet she and cheth and are talking about how terrible I am
[09/04/19, 1:48:02 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Don't let it bother you, even though that seems like a silly thing to say
[09/04/19, 1:48:03 PM] Pranathi Chicago: It is bothering you
[09/04/19, 1:48:18 PM] Pranathi Chicago: But also, that's probably why she's being this way in the first place
[09/04/19, 1:48:31 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Her opinion of you will never be unfiltered of Chet's opinion of you
[09/04/19, 1:48:37 PM] Sush: Am I such a toxic person???
[09/04/19, 1:48:42 PM] Pranathi Chicago: NO
[09/04/19, 1:48:55 PM] Sush: do you feel like I push my viewpoint down your throat?
[09/04/19, 1:48:57 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Stop letting how people who don't have your best intentions at heart define your sense of self
[09/04/19, 1:49:35 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Hardly. I think we're both as capable of saying what we want without taking offense if the other were to disagree
[09/04/19, 1:50:08 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And I imagine Oviya is too, especially with her line of work. People probably state their opinions emphatically to her all the time, so I don't know why she's targeting her own friend for saying something about her own life
[09/04/19, 1:50:36 PM] Sush: what is you knew enough to say something seemingly self aware
[09/04/19, 1:50:54 PM] Sush: And what I‚Äôm hearing from this is - leave me alone bitch don‚Äôt need u in my life
[09/04/19, 1:53:06 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah, so pay  heed and run the fuck away
[09/04/19, 1:53:14 PM] Pranathi Chicago: You don't need someone who's literally shouting at you like that
[09/04/19, 1:53:20 PM] Pranathi Chicago: It's dehumanizing and has so little to do with you
[09/04/19, 1:53:38 PM] Pranathi Chicago: She's reacting as though she's hurt for something that I can't really understand why she's mad at
[09/04/19, 1:53:55 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Weird sentence construction, sorry. Trying to write my special field and I hate academic writing
[09/04/19, 1:54:21 PM] Sush: More than hurt she‚Äôs talking to me like she‚Äôs disgusted with who I am and everything I‚Äôm about
[09/04/19, 2:16:00 PM] Pranathi Chicago: She has to do that in order to believe that she's justified in speaking to you this way
[09/04/19, 7:30:57 PM] Sush: Hey, I was not talking critically about any institutions or attempting to have an intellectually neutral conversation - I was in a vulnerable place, hurting and confused, and talked about how I was feeling. I felt like ranting about wtf are men and why can‚Äôt they ever keep it in their pants was not very nice to say to someone who‚Äôs about to get married, so I said maybe I shouldn‚Äôt be talking to you about it - I did not and do not suggest that my disillusionment had anything to do with your choices at all. My disillusionment has nothing to do with your choices and your choices have nothing to do with how I feel about anything.
[09/04/19, 7:31:07 PM] Sush: Sorry this is for oviya
[09/04/19, 7:31:19 PM] Sush: Again I did alarmist text
[09/04/19, 7:32:22 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Hahaha
[09/04/19, 7:32:27 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Sorry dude my landlord came over
[09/04/19, 7:32:40 PM] Pranathi Chicago: My bathtub is leaking so they have to replace it
[09/04/19, 7:33:04 PM] Sush: No worries!
[09/04/19, 7:33:04 PM] Pranathi Chicago: The text is very cogent
[09/04/19, 7:33:08 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I like it
[09/04/19, 7:33:16 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I also like that you didn't try to apologize
[09/04/19, 7:33:34 PM] Pranathi Chicago: The clarification is important and necessary tho. Because her attack on you was vitriolic
[09/04/19, 7:34:38 PM] Sush: Clearly, we are no longer in a place to talk about anything that‚Äôs actually going on in ourselves. You‚Äôve been saying in many ways (and on twitter) that you want out - I hear you. Message received.
[09/04/19, 7:34:45 PM] Sush: *in our lives
[09/04/19, 7:35:07 PM] Sush: Or is that unnecessary
[09/04/19, 7:35:23 PM] Sush: I want to call out the slytweeting crap
[09/04/19, 7:35:38 PM] Sush: Devil looming over her
[09/04/19, 7:35:52 PM] Pranathi Chicago: That feels a bit unnecessary because she might think you're writing that stuff in the first text only because you're upset about the slytweeting
[09/04/19, 7:36:05 PM] Sush: True
[09/04/19, 7:36:12 PM] Sush: But I want to say fuck you
[09/04/19, 7:36:12 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Although I don't think that comes across like that to me, I can see how she might ignore your first text
[09/04/19, 7:36:27 PM] Pranathi Chicago: So I would wait for her to respond to that and then tell her to fuck the fuck off
[09/04/19, 7:36:53 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah the slytweeting is so passive aggressive
[09/04/19, 7:37:01 PM] Pranathi Chicago: But also like, send off both texts
[09/04/19, 7:37:06 PM] Pranathi Chicago: If you just want to be done with her
[09/04/19, 7:37:15 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I would just hate if she was like
K bye
[09/04/19, 7:37:21 PM] Sush: Yeah
[09/04/19, 7:37:35 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Without engaging at all on how her message was totally inappropriate and needlessly aggressive
[09/04/19, 7:38:06 PM] Sush: I‚Äôm over being chastised constantly. You‚Äôve been communicating in several ways that I‚Äôm not very welcome in your life - I hear you.
[09/04/19, 7:39:26 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah perfect
[09/04/19, 7:39:35 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I'm sorry you have to send this text even
[09/04/19, 7:39:37 PM] Pranathi Chicago: It's so painful
[09/04/19, 7:42:17 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Sorry to randomly digress but see this:

[09/04/19, 7:44:38 PM] Pranathi Chicago: But I feel like tweetiquette demands I don't retweet although some academics I respect who follow me would see and that might be the "smart" move not that anyone cares ofc but still this is the kind of thing "successful" grad students tweet
[09/04/19, 7:45:01 PM] Sush: Totally retweet it
[09/04/19, 7:45:19 PM] Sush: That‚Äôs obnoxious when you retweet 50 things about yourself
[09/04/19, 7:45:29 PM] Sush: One is totally normal and lovely üíï
[09/04/19, 7:46:01 PM] Sush: That tweetiquette is for celebrities
[09/04/19, 7:46:05 PM] Sush: Not ya
[09/04/19, 7:46:07 PM] Sush: *us
[09/04/19, 7:46:15 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Hahaha okay
[09/04/19, 7:46:33 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Will do and thanks for teaching me tweetiquette
[09/04/19, 7:46:38 PM] Pranathi Chicago: ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄ
[09/04/19, 7:47:25 PM] Sush: üíïüòò
[09/04/19, 7:48:43 PM] Sush: It‚Äôs fairly twisted to decide to attribute the worst imaginable motives to anything I say or do and then go on to chastise me for it. You‚Äôre saying I‚Äôm not welcome in your life - Im hearing you.
[09/04/19, 7:48:47 PM] Sush: Sorry lol
[09/04/19, 7:48:56 PM] Sush: Multiple iterations of that message #2
[09/04/19, 7:52:31 PM] Sush: It‚Äôs fairly twisted actually to decide to attribute the worst imaginable motives to anything I say or do and then go on to chastise me harshly for it. You‚Äôre saying I‚Äôm not welcome in your life, and you‚Äôve probably been communicating some version of that for a while - and I hear you.
[09/04/19, 7:52:34 PM] Sush: Sent!
[09/04/19, 7:54:26 PM] Sush: should I also play twitter and change my bio to ‚Äòtwisted af‚Äô
[10/04/19, 9:26:53 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Sorry I didn't reply last night
[10/04/19, 9:26:57 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I ended up getting konjam blazed and then had no ability to deal with my phone lol
[10/04/19, 9:27:10 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Did she reply to you?
[10/04/19, 9:27:28 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Twisted like a Twister champion
[10/04/19, 9:27:36 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Twisted like the whomping willow
[10/04/19, 9:27:55 AM] Pranathi Chicago: So many nice parallels you could make with a twisted af bio haha
[10/04/19, 9:28:13 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Screw that though. I hate that she made you feel like it was on you.
[10/04/19, 2:06:11 PM] Sush: ‚ù§

[14/04/19, 3:17:41 PM] Sush: i know himmmm
[14/04/19, 3:17:48 PM] Sush: means we've met
[14/04/19, 3:17:53 PM] Sush: i don't *know* him
[14/04/19, 3:17:58 PM] Pranathi Chicago: What did you think?
[14/04/19, 3:18:07 PM] Pranathi Chicago: He seems to annoy me a little but that could just be because he's Tam
[14/04/19, 3:18:10 PM] Sush: he seemed very young
[14/04/19, 3:18:24 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I think I am prejudiced against Tam guys
[14/04/19, 3:20:37 PM] Sush: me too i think
[14/04/19, 3:20:52 PM] Sush: idk
[14/04/19, 3:20:58 PM] Sush: maybe just all guys lol
[14/04/19, 3:21:09 PM] Sush: u are 100000x cooler than vishruth tho
[14/04/19, 3:21:40 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I know I'm way too cool for him lol he's also explaining to me his entire family history all of a sudden
[14/04/19, 3:21:47 PM] Sush: hahaha
[14/04/19, 3:21:52 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I am sometimes shocked at my lack of interest in people and their lives
[14/04/19, 3:21:58 PM] Sush: lolol!
[14/04/19, 3:22:04 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Then again, did I ask?
[14/04/19, 3:22:22 PM] Sush: once u find someone attractive the minutiae of their lives are sooo fascinating lol
[14/04/19, 3:22:38 PM] Pranathi Chicago: If not, stop making this sound like jadagam matching
[14/04/19, 3:22:41 PM] Pranathi Chicago: what your appa does, what your thatha did
[14/04/19, 3:22:47 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I knowwww it's been so long since I felt that
[14/04/19, 3:22:56 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I think I am broken
[14/04/19, 3:23:07 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Like the feelings part
[14/04/19, 3:23:08 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Not the rest of me
[14/04/19, 3:23:10 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I am whole and well
[14/04/19, 3:23:17 PM] Pranathi Chicago: But I am finding it hard to catch feelings
[14/04/19, 3:23:21 PM] Sush: it just needs to be triggered by someone
[14/04/19, 3:23:41 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Where are all the people I might find attractive?
[14/04/19, 3:23:45 PM] Sush: i think catching feelings is a function of two people
[14/04/19, 3:23:49 PM] Pranathi Chicago: It's like there's another Twitter they're not telling us about
[14/04/19, 3:23:53 PM] Pranathi Chicago: *Tinder
[14/04/19, 3:23:57 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Lol
[14/04/19, 3:23:59 PM] Sush: edge property, not a node property
[14/04/19, 3:24:00 PM] Sush: hahaha
[14/04/19, 3:24:02 PM] Sush: maybeeee
[14/04/19, 3:24:17 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Edge propertyyyy
[14/04/19, 3:24:30 PM] Pranathi Chicago: We have that in spatial data science also edge effects
[14/04/19, 3:24:36 PM] Sush: ya these network analogies are blowing my mind
[14/04/19, 3:24:44 PM] Sush: even 'interesting' is an edge property
[14/04/19, 3:24:57 PM] Sush: no one is interesting or boring by themselves!
[14/04/19, 3:24:59 PM] Sush: or attractive
[14/04/19, 3:25:00 PM] Sush: or fun
[14/04/19, 3:25:02 PM] Sush: or anything lol
[14/04/19, 3:25:09 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah correct
[14/04/19, 3:25:23 PM] Pranathi Chicago: It is constructed interactionally
[14/04/19, 3:25:33 PM] Sush: yaaaa!
[14/04/19, 3:25:40 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Anyway, I just need to touch someone
[14/04/19, 3:25:45 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I miss touching
[14/04/19, 3:25:48 PM] Sush: (riddhima is coming - should i be mad at her? she's bringing ice cream)
[14/04/19, 3:25:52 PM] Sush: that's v fair
[14/04/19, 3:26:18 PM] Pranathi Chicago: You react to how she's treating you. If she is being aware of how hurtful that might've been, forgive, otherwise you tell her how you're feeling
[14/04/19, 3:26:26 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I hope she apologizes
[14/04/19, 3:26:37 PM] Sush: correct
[14/04/19, 3:27:28 PM] Pranathi Chicago: There is a guy on Tinder who juggles
[14/04/19, 3:27:31 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And is a grad student
[14/04/19, 3:27:39 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And all his pics are of him juggling
[14/04/19, 3:37:44 PM] Sush: Hahaha
[14/04/19, 3:37:46 PM] Sush: I like that
[14/04/19, 11:01:04 PM] Pranathi Chicago: [5:43 PM, 4/14/2019] Tejas Rao: Ok cool, I'll be up for a bit, so can talk anytime after also, when you're free.
[9:00 PM, 4/14/2019] Tejas Rao: Hola, just got home, free the rest of the evening. Let me know when you are free to talk.
[15/04/19, 8:59:00 AM] Sush: omg i can't stand this meghan
[15/04/19, 8:59:43 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Who's Meghan?
[15/04/19, 9:24:03 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Tejas' text after I told him I'd like to reduce the frequency of our talking: Yeah, but some of that is a consequence of us having busy/changing schedules, but also wanting to make some time for each other. I agree that spontaneity is important, but finding time to talk isn't intended to be cumbersome/take away from that.
[15/04/19, 9:24:12 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Why is he talking like we've been in a five year relationship
[15/04/19, 9:25:27 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I said: [11:41 PM, 4/14/2019] Pranathi Diwakar: While I'm excited about our potential connection, I would like to reduce the frequency of our calls and communication
[11:43 PM, 4/14/2019] Pranathi Diwakar: But I am excited to hang out in person and spend time together. I am sure that will be meaningful and interesting and such a relief
[15/04/19, 9:26:03 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Also me: I'm not saying we shouldn't talk at all obviously. But just, the past few days, it seems like it's always about trying to find a time to talk instead of letting it be a little more spontaneous
[15/04/19, 11:34:37 AM] Sush: Ayyo!
[15/04/19, 11:34:46 AM] Sush: Good you said what you needed to tho
[15/04/19, 11:34:55 AM] Sush: hopefully he'll back down slightly?
[15/04/19, 11:35:37 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Hopefully! I think he's very hurt though
[15/04/19, 11:35:45 AM] Pranathi Chicago: He was quite curt, understandably, and I think he thinks it's a sign I'm no longer interested
[15/04/19, 11:35:54 AM] Sush: Ayy :(
[15/04/19, 11:36:23 AM] Sush: Paavam, it makes sense but really can't be helped also
[15/04/19, 11:36:33 AM] Sush: and it's better than leaving him on read
[15/04/19, 11:38:43 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah true
[15/04/19, 11:38:49 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I hate that feeling of being left on read
[15/04/19, 11:38:54 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Not fair to do it to someone else
[15/04/19, 11:39:08 AM] Pranathi Chicago: But I tried to be kind, I think. I told him I'm eager to see how it goes when we see each other in person
[15/04/19, 11:41:37 AM] Sush: That's very reasonable!
[15/04/19, 11:51:16 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I matched with someone on Bumble who is so hot
[15/04/19, 11:51:24 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And his arms are... divine
[15/04/19, 11:51:28 AM] Sush: meet himmmmm
[15/04/19, 11:51:30 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Also he offered me free tennis lesson
[15/04/19, 11:51:37 AM] Pranathi Chicago: He's the UChicago tennis coach
[15/04/19, 11:51:40 AM] Sush: üòÇ
[15/04/19, 11:51:43 AM] Sush: oooh!
[15/04/19, 11:52:15 AM] Sush: very nice first date idea
‚Äé[15/04/19, 11:52:19 AM] Pranathi Chicago: ‚Äéimage omitted
[15/04/19, 11:52:30 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah but then if I suck I will be embraaace
[15/04/19, 11:52:54 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Also built like he is, he'll probably laugh if I can't get the ball over the net. Which I def won't be able to do
[15/04/19, 11:53:11 AM] Sush: hahaha fairrr i'd worry about that too
[15/04/19, 11:55:28 AM] Sush: meet off otherwise!
[15/04/19, 11:55:44 AM] Sush: pic not loading, bad connection
[15/04/19, 11:55:55 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yes yes I shall meet
[15/04/19, 11:56:02 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Dude I am struggling to finish this essay
[15/04/19, 11:56:04 AM] Pranathi Chicago: It is so boring
[15/04/19, 11:56:12 AM] Sush: üò≠
[15/04/19, 11:56:18 AM] Sush: i had to email patrick today -_-
[15/04/19, 11:56:26 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Ughh about work?
[15/04/19, 11:56:30 AM] Sush: and then he texted me something casual with a gif about the email
[15/04/19, 11:56:36 AM] Sush: like DON'T
[15/04/19, 11:56:41 AM] Sush: it felt a bit hurtful
[15/04/19, 11:56:59 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Soooo hurtful
[15/04/19, 11:57:14 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Like it hurts to be in touch with someone you're trying to get over
[15/04/19, 11:57:18 AM] Pranathi Chicago: But I guess he's also hurting
[15/04/19, 11:57:37 AM] Sush: this makes him looks like he's not!
[15/04/19, 11:57:47 AM] Pranathi Chicago: It's the machoness man
[15/04/19, 11:57:53 AM] Pranathi Chicago: He probably wants to play it "casual"
[15/04/19, 11:58:15 AM] Sush: ü§¨
[15/04/19, 11:58:23 AM] Sush: or he's just COMPLETELY over me
[15/04/19, 12:00:00 PM] Pranathi Chicago: No way
[15/04/19, 12:00:01 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Lol
[15/04/19, 12:00:18 PM] Pranathi Chicago: You don't get over someone so quickly after cheating on your wife for them, and you know that
[15/04/19, 12:00:28 PM] Sush: also i think he thought i was thinner than i am
[15/04/19, 12:00:51 PM] Sush: and when he discovered otherwise he's like eh
[15/04/19, 12:01:47 PM] Sush: i hear myself
[15/04/19, 12:02:02 PM] Sush: but also idk i'm feeling hurt!
[15/04/19, 12:11:55 PM] Pranathi Chicago: It's normal to feel hurt
[15/04/19, 12:11:55 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And I would also feel so so so hurt in your position
[15/04/19, 12:12:24 PM] Pranathi Chicago: He saw your body before at work also no? It's not like there was anything new. So the thinness stuff sounds less like it's coming from him
[15/04/19, 12:13:21 PM] Sush: but i conceal it more in clothes
[15/04/19, 12:15:19 PM] Sush: probably partly me
[15/04/19, 12:16:14 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah but I think he's really into you
[15/04/19, 12:16:44 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And I don't have to convince you because the point is that we're also not wanting him to be into you because then it'll make you want to be with him more sighhhh
[15/04/19, 12:18:33 PM] Sush: üò≠
[15/04/19, 12:18:41 PM] Sush: why can't he just be into me tho
[15/04/19, 12:18:43 PM] Sush: ugh
[15/04/19, 12:18:46 PM] Sush: something
[15/04/19, 12:18:52 PM] Sush: how's your monday shaping up friend
[15/04/19, 12:21:24 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Hahaha
[15/04/19, 12:21:27 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I hear you
[15/04/19, 12:21:33 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Monday is fine
[15/04/19, 12:21:35 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I wrote some 2000 words
[15/04/19, 12:21:39 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I think I am hitting my limit
[15/04/19, 12:21:48 PM] Sush: awesome! ‚ù§
[15/04/19, 12:21:52 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Writing is just spurts of productivity for me. And then I do nothing the rest of the day
[15/04/19, 12:21:58 PM] Pranathi Chicago: But I think it's okay
[15/04/19, 12:24:20 PM] Sush: 2000 words is great progress!
[15/04/19, 12:24:27 PM] Sush: takes a ton of energy no
[15/04/19, 12:51:26 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeahhh it's exhausting
[15/04/19, 12:51:30 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Okay 2.5k and I'm calling it a day
[15/04/19, 12:51:36 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Should I go to the gym today?
[15/04/19, 1:14:38 PM] Sush: go off!

[16/04/19, 3:43:25 PM] Sush: i like how she talks
[16/04/19, 3:43:30 PM] Sush: ew fuckoff woobens
[16/04/19, 3:43:36 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And I said, "Does it count as a humblebrag if I'm actually bragging?"
[16/04/19, 3:43:48 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I don't think so. Fucking idiot
[16/04/19, 3:43:55 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah even I like how Sharvari talks
[16/04/19, 3:43:58 PM] Pranathi Chicago: She writes really well also

[16/04/19, 3:46:27 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Then came home and I'm trying to write but it's boring
[16/04/19, 3:50:38 PM] Sush: lovely!
[16/04/19, 3:50:45 PM] Sush: why is all work fundamentally dull lol
[16/04/19, 3:52:04 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Haha I just want to be lazy

[16/04/19, 3:53:26 PM] Sush: sameeeeeee
[16/04/19, 3:53:31 PM] Sush: i miss the point
[17/04/19, 7:56:59 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Hi we're working at Chicago Athleic Center today no?
[17/04/19, 10:02:47 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Hi don't tell paws that you're going downtown today
[17/04/19, 10:03:12 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I told her I'm working downtown w Bindu
[17/04/19, 10:03:18 AM] Sush: ooh ok!
[17/04/19, 10:03:23 AM] Sush: haven't talked to it
[17/04/19, 10:14:57 AM] Pranathi Chicago: ETA?
[17/04/19, 10:15:15 AM] Sush: 10:56
[17/04/19, 10:15:28 AM] Sush: Aap kidhar ?
[17/04/19, 10:16:22 AM] Sush: bus randomly stopped on sheridan for like ten mins
[17/04/19, 10:27:24 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I reached off
[17/04/19, 10:27:28 AM] Pranathi Chicago: No worries
[18/04/19, 10:31:42 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Hi! I feel like I struck a wrong chord with you on the phone last night about the MBA thing. I could tell that it annoyed you, but I was obviously being flippant and ofc they value what they do and I'm no one to sit judgment on it. I said it somewhat cavalierly, and I hope you're not still annoyed.
[18/04/19, 12:42:17 PM] Sush: Hii was in a meeting
[18/04/19, 12:43:08 PM] Sush: I'm not annoyed! I just disagreed, I wasn't annoyed :)
[18/04/19, 12:43:27 PM] Sush: Didn't intend to come off as annoyed
[18/04/19, 12:43:31 PM] Sush: How was your datee
[18/04/19, 12:43:42 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Okay! üíïüíï
[18/04/19, 12:43:49 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Date was good. We had sex
[18/04/19, 12:43:57 PM] Pranathi Chicago: He was really hot and funny and interesting
[18/04/19, 12:44:05 PM] Sush: so niiiiiice
[18/04/19, 12:44:10 PM] Pranathi Chicago: But now he's sort of awol, it's only been a few hours tho
[18/04/19, 12:44:19 PM] Pranathi Chicago: But still I get the sense he might be a flake
[18/04/19, 12:51:12 PM] Sush: what is his name?
[18/04/19, 12:51:57 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Kris
[18/04/19, 12:52:02 PM] Sush: JENNER
[18/04/19, 12:52:08 PM] Pranathi Chicago: He was way too hot for me
[18/04/19, 12:52:17 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Like his body was rock solid and he had those pelvic abs
[18/04/19, 12:52:21 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I felt so dumpy
[18/04/19, 12:52:38 PM] Sush: hahaha noo he was clearly with you because he was attracted to you!
[18/04/19, 12:52:57 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah I guess. We had sex twice but then he didn't want to stay over
[18/04/19, 12:53:10 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Which might be heightening my feelings of vulnerability atm
[18/04/19, 12:53:41 PM] Sush: that does suck!
[18/04/19, 12:53:50 PM] Sush: i hear you - it makes me feel vulnerable too
[18/04/19, 12:54:48 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And he hasn't responded to my text ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄ
[18/04/19, 12:54:58 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Who knows, that might be the last we hear of him
[18/04/19, 12:55:07 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Men set a low bar so I'm fully preparing to be ghosted
[18/04/19, 12:55:10 PM] Sush: it's still morning! doesn't mean anything
[18/04/19, 12:55:24 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah haha that's true
[18/04/19, 12:56:44 PM] Sush: dude
[18/04/19, 12:56:46 PM] Sush: til
[18/04/19, 12:56:56 PM] Sush: you're supposed to store nut butter jars upside down
[18/04/19, 12:57:10 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Whaaa why so?

[16/05/19, 10:36:40 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Can you bliw?

[16/05/19, 10:37:40 PM] Pranathi Chicago: You know that day Mike and I were supposed to go to the show but missed it? Andrew would've been there for sure
[16/05/19, 10:37:49 PM] Pranathi Chicago: It felt very symbolic somehow
[16/05/19, 10:37:53 PM] Sush: hahaha
[16/05/19, 10:38:08 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah I should ignore Mike
[16/05/19, 10:38:11 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I won't text him until Sunday

[16/05/19, 10:38:22 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Because I like her v much
[16/05/19, 10:38:29 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Although I should just keep working instead of going out for ice cream
[16/05/19, 10:39:39 PM] Sush: no ice cream is an unequivocally good thing
[16/05/19, 10:39:43 PM] Sush: i told my mom this today
[16/05/19, 10:39:48 PM] Sush: and she laughed in my face
[16/05/19, 10:39:50 PM] Sush: idk
[16/05/19, 10:41:26 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Hahaha
[16/05/19, 10:41:32 PM] Pranathi Chicago: She probably was tickled at your eloquence

[16/05/19, 10:42:56 PM] Pranathi Chicago: LOL
[16/05/19, 10:43:00 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Is it because she ate rajma
[16/05/19, 10:43:01 PM] Sush: srsly

[16/05/19, 10:44:27 PM] Sush: i asked off
[16/05/19, 10:44:48 PM] Pranathi Chicago: She keeps saying she has made nice rajma for dinner
[16/05/19, 10:44:58 PM] Pranathi Chicago: My brother also said he is gassy, or was like two days ago
[16/05/19, 10:45:06 PM] Pranathi Chicago: But then he said "with time difference and distance it adds up"
[16/05/19, 10:45:11 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I think he will make a fine scientist
[16/05/19, 10:46:11 PM] Sush: hahaha

[23/05/19, 11:09:43 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Got itttt
[23/05/19, 11:09:57 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I just wanted to talk about Mike but feel like that would be boring anyway lol
[23/05/19, 11:10:09 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I feel like maybe I've been talking about him too much lately?
[23/05/19, 11:10:12 AM] Sush: noo tell me heeere
[23/05/19, 11:10:26 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Okay!
[23/05/19, 11:10:32 AM] Pranathi Chicago: He's been very very very sweet
[23/05/19, 11:10:48 AM] Pranathi Chicago: But he's clearly going to see other people
[23/05/19, 11:11:38 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And I think I'm okay with it but sometimes I'm not sure I have the lack of jealousy that he seems to miraculously possess
[23/05/19, 11:11:38 AM] Sush: that's so nice! I love how you sound genuinely excited about him!
[23/05/19, 11:12:08 AM] Sush: Fair! I guess see how you feel as things unfold?
[23/05/19, 11:12:07 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yesterday some guy was hitting on me and Mike was encouraging me to like hit on him and I am not sure I could be so chill if it was him and some girl
[23/05/19, 11:12:28 AM] Pranathi Chicago: So I feel like I am not woke enough to have poly type relationship
[23/05/19, 11:12:48 AM] Sush: It's woke to listen to your feelings, don't fall into this trap!
[23/05/19, 11:13:11 AM] Sush: It's 100% valid if you're ok with it and 100% valid if you're not
[23/05/19, 11:13:23 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I really am. He's got this amazing way of being entirely empathetic and open to communicating about anything. Also I love that he's such a good friend to his friends, and he's deeply intelligent
[23/05/19, 11:13:39 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Also the sex is the best I think
[23/05/19, 11:13:51 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah you're right. What is wokeness after all
[23/05/19, 11:14:17 AM] Sush: those are all wonderful things!
[23/05/19, 11:14:23 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Also, is Uday okay? Did he tell you or did you only glean from Sneha? I don't know whether to text him about it because I don't want to be condescending
[23/05/19, 11:14:37 AM] Sush: ya fuck all this woke. un-woke is if you're like eww poly that's BS
[23/05/19, 11:15:08 AM] Sush: and again, like marriage, it's kinda moot to talk about whether you're into it or not in general
[23/05/19, 11:15:22 AM] Sush: you can only think about is THIS relationship with THIS person working for me
[23/05/19, 11:16:55 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah true
[23/05/19, 11:17:02 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I like the way you think
[23/05/19, 11:17:10 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I feel very into him though
[23/05/19, 11:17:22 AM] Sush: so nice!!!
[23/05/19, 11:17:25 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I sense that this could be either a very very beautiful thing or like a mess
[23/05/19, 11:17:35 AM] Sush: hahaha
[23/05/19, 11:18:33 AM] Sush: i hear you
[23/05/19, 11:18:51 AM] Sush: but does it feel nice to feel this way instead of meh..?
[23/05/19, 11:19:09 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah for sure :(
[23/05/19, 11:19:11 AM] Pranathi Chicago: :)
[23/05/19, 11:19:28 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I am genuinely excited about a male instead of being like yuck
[23/05/19, 11:19:36 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Which is surprising
[23/05/19, 11:19:52 AM] Sush: yes!!

[23/05/19, 11:20:32 AM] Sush: then i can put a face to the name
[23/05/19, 11:21:00 AM] Pranathi Chicago: He is veeeery different from who I think you will expect to see haha
[23/05/19, 11:21:05 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Fair warning

[10/06/19, 11:31:52 AM] Sush: uuuugh
[10/06/19, 11:31:55 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I hate that she's telling stories about *my* life to people. And like I was saying yesterday, it's just a "story" for her
[10/06/19, 11:32:03 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Like a fun, awkward, sad, can-you-believe type thing
[10/06/19, 11:32:19 AM] Sush: ugh i feel like we need to bring this up
[10/06/19, 11:32:23 AM] Pranathi Chicago: It's my goddamn life and I'm sad and I don't want her telling random people like I'm some sort of loser that didn't even see it coming

[10/06/19, 11:37:26 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I don't know whether she will go tell off to P
[10/06/19, 11:38:08 AM] Sush: true
[10/06/19, 11:38:43 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I decided to do a thing but now I'm feeling really silly for doing it
[10/06/19, 11:38:53 AM] Sush: kya sis
[10/06/19, 11:39:28 AM] Sush: say 2 me
[10/06/19, 11:39:38 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I am feeling very embarrassed and pathetic
[10/06/19, 11:40:05 AM] Sush: don't be! #safespace
[10/06/19, 11:40:17 AM] Pranathi Chicago: So I was telling Mike about how I found these jazz maps of Chicago from the 1920s like a month ago, and he was so excited by the idea. He asked if I can show him some time. So I requested it from special collections and thought I'd walk over with him during our coffee meet and show, as like birthday gift. But now it seems so cheesy and OTT and he will clearly know I am pathetic at the core
[10/06/19, 11:40:17 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Should I just cancel it
[10/06/19, 11:40:28 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Like I should be ANGRY no?
[10/06/19, 11:40:37 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Instead of bending over backwards like some lame female
[10/06/19, 11:40:48 AM] Sush: that's so sweet
[10/06/19, 11:41:05 AM] Sush: it's not lame or pathetic at all!
[10/06/19, 11:41:32 AM] Pranathi Chicago: But what if he's like "oh i'm too busy?" or he thinks, "oh wow what a loser I dumped her, and she's still so into me that she went to all this trouble... she must be despo"
[10/06/19, 11:41:32 AM] Sush: but it's vulnerable and you need to decide if you're ok with being vulnerable (and it's 100% ok to choose either way)
[10/06/19, 11:41:58 AM] Sush: it's really sweet and thoughtful and you requested it when you were dating
[10/06/19, 11:42:08 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah the vulnerability seems dumb considering I paid a penalty just now for being vulnerable.
[10/06/19, 11:42:12 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Lol no I requested it this morning
[10/06/19, 11:42:15 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I AM SO PATHETIC

[10/06/19, 11:42:35 AM] Sush: you're not pathetic!!! you're kind
[10/06/19, 11:42:53 AM] Pranathi Chicago: I think it's a sign of real dumbness.
[10/06/19, 11:43:04 AM] Pranathi Chicago: If you broke up with someone, but wanted to still be friends, and they did this for you - how would you react?
[10/06/19, 11:43:10 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Would you think "how lame?" be honest
[10/06/19, 11:43:17 AM] Sush: and it's like you had all these warm feelings and the receptacle of those feelings withdrew for some random reason but those feelings are still there
[10/06/19, 11:43:22 AM] Sush: no it's not lame at all
[10/06/19, 11:43:37 AM] Pranathi Chicago: But what if he is grossed out by my feelings?
[10/06/19, 11:43:39 AM] Sush: newsid put fight to see if he could come to chicago a few months ago when he was in america
[10/06/19, 11:43:43 AM] Sush: and i thought it was sweet
[10/06/19, 11:43:44 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Why am I this oozing wound of gushing feelings
[10/06/19, 11:43:57 AM] Sush: he won't be grossed out i promise
[10/06/19, 11:44:04 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Aww that is sweet
[10/06/19, 11:44:23 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Sigh, okay. I'll decide while we're having coffee. If he's being nice, I'll take him. Otherwise I'll pack and pretend I didn't do that
[10/06/19, 11:44:24 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Lol

[14/06/19, 1:01:26 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Why?
[14/06/19, 1:01:39 PM] Sush: I was feeling very low and I called

[14/06/19, 1:02:04 PM] Sush: So I said nothing I don‚Äôt want to talk
[14/06/19, 1:02:11 PM] Sush: I mean she apologised immediately
[14/06/19, 1:02:29 PM] Sush: Saying she had been up for some twenty hours and exhausted
[14/06/19, 1:02:49 PM] Sush: and after that we keep missing each other
[14/06/19, 1:03:03 PM] Sush: So I think that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm also placing more weight more on it
[14/06/19, 1:05:39 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Don't be stressed friend

[15/06/19, 7:47:55 PM] Sush: No babe of course you‚Äôre having feelings
[15/06/19, 7:48:20 PM] Pranathi Chicago: :( I think I am saddest because at least with Nick, I knew that we already tried to make things work and still they failed miserably
[15/06/19, 7:48:23 PM] Pranathi Chicago: So no regrets
[15/06/19, 7:48:33 PM] Sush: That‚Äôs true :(

[15/06/19, 7:49:15 PM] Pranathi Chicago: What kind of friendship is that!
[15/06/19, 7:49:35 PM] Sush: You probably need some space before you can be friends no?
[15/06/19, 7:49:42 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah, that's true
[15/06/19, 7:49:49 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I really need to just let it go and not text him for like a week
[15/06/19, 7:49:54 PM] Pranathi Chicago: It's just so hard
[15/06/19, 7:49:58 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I have zero will power as a person
[15/06/19, 7:50:00 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Like ZERO

[30/06/19, 6:51:15 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yay for naps!
[30/06/19, 6:51:37 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I just got the feeling that maybe you were trying to avoid me, so I thought I'll tell you off instead of wondering
[30/06/19, 6:51:44 PM] Pranathi Chicago: But it could also just be totally in my head
[30/06/19, 6:52:47 PM] Sush: Not at all!

[01/07/19, 2:18:37 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Did you watch Aus Bachelor?
[01/07/19, 2:18:43 PM] Sush: literally can't stop watching
[01/07/19, 2:18:46 PM] Sush: no :(
[01/07/19, 2:18:56 PM] Sush: i can't watch the US one also by myself
[01/07/19, 2:19:00 PM] Sush: it's too sordid
[01/07/19, 2:19:06 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Dude, how to tell this Woobens I don't want to hang out?
[01/07/19, 2:19:09 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Like at all.
[01/07/19, 2:19:17 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Every week he texts me and I've sort of been curt/ignored him
[01/07/19, 2:19:23 PM] Pranathi Chicago: But he's not getting the hint at all.
[01/07/19, 2:19:45 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I don't want to hurt his feelings, but it's also getting sort of painful
[01/07/19, 2:20:17 PM] Sush: oh man :(
[01/07/19, 2:20:22 PM] Sush: he sounds like he's flailing
[01/07/19, 2:21:03 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah. :( He said he restarted therapy which I think is good
[01/07/19, 2:22:27 PM] Sush: oh good!
[01/07/19, 2:22:38 PM] Sush: tell you're busy for a few weeks
[01/07/19, 2:23:50 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah I'm saying like that
[01/07/19, 2:24:03 PM] Pranathi Chicago: do you think this is how Mike feels about me?
[01/07/19, 2:24:22 PM] Sush: Not parallel situations!
[01/07/19, 2:25:13 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Okay, you're right
[01/07/19, 2:25:21 PM] Pranathi Chicago: How's your Monday going?
[01/07/19, 2:25:31 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I just read a lot of Bourdieu who writes like a dumb Parisian prick
[01/07/19, 2:25:34 PM] Pranathi Chicago: But he has some good points
[01/07/19, 2:26:02 PM] Sush: i am reading a pair of germans today
[01/07/19, 2:26:19 PM] Sush: writing about how to isolate cohesive subgroups in graph structures
[01/07/19, 2:26:45 PM] Sush: they are also fairly obtuse and resort to math when they can't explain intuition which is v annoying
[01/07/19, 2:28:11 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Ugh that sounds frustrating
[01/07/19, 2:28:22 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I feel like reading academics is an exercise in learning how not to write
[01/07/19, 2:28:45 PM] Sush: srsly! Andy was talking about that today
[01/07/19, 2:28:49 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Also, I read this article and I'm just going to leave it here if at all you want to access it, but I should also offer cw: loss of a loved one - https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/07/08/the-lingering-of-loss
[01/07/19, 2:28:50 PM] Sush: i think he writes really well
[01/07/19, 2:29:02 PM] Pranathi Chicago: But also feel free to ignore if you don't want to go down that path
[01/07/19, 2:29:12 PM] Sush: thank you friend ‚ù§ i will bookmark
[01/07/19, 2:29:25 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I've never read his work actually. I should read something he's written!
[01/07/19, 2:29:33 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I also love how Marco writes
[01/07/19, 2:29:38 PM] Pranathi Chicago: He writes so simply but so elegantly
[01/07/19, 2:29:52 PM] Sush: yeah? that's such a rare combination
[01/07/19, 2:31:12 PM] Sush: i like how thoughtful marco sounds
[01/07/19, 2:31:55 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah, even the way he speaks and teaches exemplifies his modest genius
[01/07/19, 2:32:02 PM] Pranathi Chicago: He's so modest
[01/07/19, 2:32:07 PM] Pranathi Chicago: So brilliant
[01/07/19, 2:32:16 PM] Sush: avp isn't modest at alllll lol
[01/07/19, 2:32:34 PM] Sush: like, he's not a dick
[01/07/19, 2:32:37 PM] Sush: but he's a showman
[01/07/19, 2:32:45 PM] Sush: *andy
[01/07/19, 2:32:53 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Hahaaa but that's also attractive in its own way
[01/07/19, 2:33:12 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Sometimes I wish Marco wasn't so modest
[01/07/19, 2:33:21 PM] Pranathi Chicago: It would be so much. Enter for his career
[01/07/19, 2:33:31 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Better
[01/07/19, 2:33:36 PM] Sush: over the last two months i've seen him narrate this story - about how JUST YESTERDAY his journal app (üôÑ) showed him a photo of his moving truck from *exactly* one year ago
[01/07/19, 2:33:56 PM] Sush: he has done this on 5 different occasions
[01/07/19, 2:34:00 PM] Pranathi Chicago: What's the point of this story haha?
[01/07/19, 2:34:00 PM] Sush: over the course of TWO MONTHS
[01/07/19, 2:34:08 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Where did he move from?

[01/07/19, 2:34:54 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Did he realize?
[01/07/19, 2:35:05 PM] Sush: it's actually kinda funny how everyone in the lab makes jokes about andy performing
[01/07/19, 2:35:17 PM] Sush: ya i told him later and laughed
[01/07/19, 2:35:21 PM] Sush: he was like story still works!!!

[01/07/19, 2:36:05 PM] Pranathi Chicago: They take themselves way too seriously
[01/07/19, 2:36:13 PM] Sush: i'm sure your paths will cross!
[01/07/19, 2:36:20 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Meanwhile Marco explains Netflix shows' plots to me

[15/07/19, 4:12:57 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And there seems to be no feminist way of saying that
[15/07/19, 4:13:06 PM] Sush: That's entirely fair
[15/07/19, 4:13:10 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Like it is a fundamentally lame thing to say I wish I had someone to carry my groceries for me
[15/07/19, 4:13:22 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Or to veg out and watch tv with
[15/07/19, 4:13:41 PM] Sush: It's not lame at all to express what you authentically desire

[15/07/19, 4:15:14 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Like the dishes
[15/07/19, 4:15:27 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Nick always did them lol
[15/07/19, 4:15:45 PM] Sush: it all comes at a cost though
[15/07/19, 4:16:01 PM] Sush: if someone's planning your trips, you're also not in charge of it anymore
[15/07/19, 4:16:17 PM] Sush: but there is a nice sharing of burdens to it
[15/07/19, 4:16:34 PM] Pranathi Chicago: True
[15/07/19, 4:16:51 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I guess if I had money I wouldn't even need a boyfriend hahah
[15/07/19, 4:16:57 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I could pay someone to do these tasks
[15/07/19, 4:17:02 PM] Sush: correct!

[15/07/19, 4:17:15 PM] Pranathi Chicago: So either money or a boyfriend
[15/07/19, 4:17:19 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Prefer money tbh
[15/07/19, 4:17:41 PM] Sush: and idk, i feel like research has shown overwhelmingly that married women actually carry more domestic responsibility
[15/07/19, 4:18:02 PM] Pranathi Chicago: That's true for sure
[15/07/19, 4:18:03 PM] Sush: not just than married men, but than single women
[15/07/19, 4:18:27 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah and also having to deal with the marriage penalty
[15/07/19, 4:18:34 PM] Sush: yeah
[15/07/19, 4:18:36 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Men get a marriage premium at work
[15/07/19, 4:18:43 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Women take a marriage penalty
[15/07/19, 4:18:48 PM] Sush: always
[15/07/19, 4:18:57 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Ugh
[15/07/19, 4:19:14 PM] Sush: i think companionship is the only problem it actually kinda solves
[15/07/19, 4:19:24 PM] Sush: apart from reproductive things
[15/07/19, 4:19:47 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah and if they're a shitty companion then it's more of a cognitive and emotional load than being single and not having to be responsible for someone else's emotional well being
[15/07/19, 4:20:05 PM] Pranathi Chicago: So the question is how to know how things will turn out with someone
[15/07/19, 4:20:07 PM] Sush: absolutely
[15/07/19, 4:20:15 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I really wish I had a crystal ball
[15/07/19, 4:20:17 PM] Sush: i think we can't know also fully
[15/07/19, 4:20:22 PM] Sush: a good part of it is luck
[15/07/19, 4:20:29 PM] Sush: and ofc listening to some red flags
[15/07/19, 4:20:44 PM] Pranathi Chicago: If I could know for certain that I'll be single and happy 60% of the time at 40, I'd take it
[15/07/19, 4:20:57 PM] Sush: i hear ya
[15/07/19, 4:21:11 PM] Sush: unfortunately i think there are significant network effects to this
[15/07/19, 4:21:22 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah, I seem to be incredibly bad at reading these haha
[15/07/19, 4:21:23 PM] Sush: or at least that's what i'd hypothesize, with zero evidence to back me
[15/07/19, 4:21:44 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Haha every good hypothesis is backed up with some experiential knowledge
[15/07/19, 4:21:52 PM] Sush: i imagine that single women with some minimum threshold of single friends are happier
[15/07/19, 4:21:59 PM] Sush: than single women with no single friends
[15/07/19, 4:22:10 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah, 100% agree with this
[15/07/19, 4:22:29 PM] Sush: just the degree to which you can offset the absence of a spousal reservoir of emotional reserves with friends
[15/07/19, 4:22:44 PM] Sush: reservoir of reserves it seems lmao
[15/07/19, 4:22:45 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I spoke with Tanvi today about Meera's wedding and I think that might have something to do with how im feeling
[15/07/19, 4:23:00 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I like it haha, very lyrical
[15/07/19, 4:23:21 PM] Sush: i think the only people who are 'good' at reading these are people who lucked out the first time and didn't need to respond to red flags
[15/07/19, 4:23:29 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Tanvi is lovely but has very square notions about companionship and marriage and all
[15/07/19, 4:23:51 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I was telling her how far off I am from all the wedding stuff, and she felt like she had to console me
[15/07/19, 4:24:03 PM] Sush: ayy
[15/07/19, 4:24:04 PM] Pranathi Chicago: She was like "don't worry you'll find someone"
[15/07/19, 4:24:35 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Paavam it's not her fault because what is there to say to that, but it totally rubbed me the wrong way
[15/07/19, 4:25:02 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And I was like you don't know that and also it shouldn't be what is offered as the balm to loneliness
[15/07/19, 4:25:02 PM] Sush: true :( and with someone who's far away it's hard to also know that's the wrong thing to say
[15/07/19, 4:25:27 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah, what I wanted to say is that I would like to have more reliable friendships
[15/07/19, 4:25:39 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Tanvi and I talk once every few months
[15/07/19, 4:25:46 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I wish we talked more and shared more
[15/07/19, 4:25:51 PM] Pranathi Chicago: She's so closed off though
[15/07/19, 4:26:10 PM] Sush: is she more of an in-person sharer?
[15/07/19, 4:26:18 PM] Pranathi Chicago: She doesn't say anything about work or her boyfriend and it's this very Tambrahm reluctance to talk about anything good
[15/07/19, 4:26:31 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Sometimes but not really
[15/07/19, 4:26:36 PM] Pranathi Chicago: She's just very closed off as a person
[15/07/19, 4:26:46 PM] Sush: aaah
[15/07/19, 4:27:21 PM] Sush: my friend vaishnavi is like that
[15/07/19, 4:27:30 PM] Sush: i like her a lot and it's always great to see her in hyd
[15/07/19, 4:27:37 PM] Sush: but we can't have like a CONVERSATION ever
[15/07/19, 4:27:42 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Anyway, I feel mostly okay but I think I just have too much time lately to dwell in my misery and loneliness
[15/07/19, 4:27:58 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah? I wonder what it is about some people
[15/07/19, 4:28:14 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I feel like that with Tanvi too
[15/07/19, 4:28:33 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I also end up sharing less as a result which is probably not the best thing for a relationship
[15/07/19, 4:28:42 PM] Sush: something must have made them wary
[15/07/19, 4:29:05 PM] Pranathi Chicago: True
[15/07/19, 4:29:13 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Done with work for the day?
[15/07/19, 4:29:28 PM] Pranathi Chicago: ‚ÄéThis message was deleted.
[15/07/19, 4:29:51 PM] Sush: omgg
[15/07/19, 4:29:56 PM] Sush: nahiiii

[15/07/19, 4:30:39 PM] Sush: how to get any work done???
[15/07/19, 4:30:42 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Omg howww
[15/07/19, 4:30:48 PM] Pranathi Chicago: That's so many meetings
[15/07/19, 4:30:53 PM] Sush: all between 9 and 4
[15/07/19, 4:31:30 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Meetings with the same people?
[15/07/19, 4:31:49 PM] Sush: no, all different
[15/07/19, 4:31:57 PM] Sush: i guess andy will be at two of them
[15/07/19, 4:33:01 PM] Sush: follow @ind0ctrination on insta!
[15/07/19, 4:33:09 PM] Sush: she's a trans medical student in manipal
[15/07/19, 4:33:21 PM] Sush: posts about her journey / life a lot
[15/07/19, 4:33:31 PM] Sush: smart and thoughtful woman!
[15/07/19, 4:33:48 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Ooh will do!
[15/07/19, 4:34:57 PM] Sush: she even posts like the cost of her hormones / surgeries etc
[15/07/19, 4:34:58 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Oooh she's so pretty
[15/07/19, 4:35:19 PM] Sush: and talks about how it's a privilege to be able to go through the transition process like this etc
[15/07/19, 4:35:24 PM] Sush: she is, no??
[15/07/19, 4:36:12 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Wow, yeah
[15/07/19, 4:36:17 PM] Pranathi Chicago: The post about self love also
[15/07/19, 4:36:22 PM] Pranathi Chicago: So vulnerable and so true
[15/07/19, 4:36:28 PM] Sush: i feel so happy to see all these young people
[15/07/19, 4:36:30 PM] Sush: ya!!
[15/07/19, 4:36:33 PM] Pranathi Chicago: There's no post-op self love unit
[15/07/19, 4:36:37 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Wow so true
[15/07/19, 4:36:42 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Aww truly
[15/07/19, 4:36:50 PM] Pranathi Chicago: It is so nice to see!!
[15/07/19, 4:37:06 PM] Sush: 'A month (?) old me. Mom wanted a daughter. Thought she didn't have one. Had one anyway. :P'
[15/07/19, 4:37:09 PM] Sush: lol she's so chill
[15/07/19, 4:37:33 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Hahaha amazing
[15/07/19, 4:37:52 PM] Sush: i'm sure having supportive parents like she seems to is soooo important
[15/07/19, 4:37:59 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I like this sort of fierce but vulnerable social media presence
[15/07/19, 4:38:03 PM] Pranathi Chicago: It is very inspiring
[15/07/19, 4:38:22 PM] Sush: some time she said 'whatever shit my parents get from others, they can still say beti doctor, beta engineer'
[15/07/19, 4:38:29 PM] Sush: it is!!!!
[15/07/19, 4:38:38 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah for suuuure. I have never heard of anyone in my family's circles even supporting their kids like this
[15/07/19, 4:38:40 PM] Sush: it's such a shift from the prev 'gen' of feminism
[15/07/19, 4:38:48 PM] Sush: ya!
[15/07/19, 4:39:02 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Hahaha so funny and so cute
[15/07/19, 4:39:26 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah, I'm so curious to see what our generation's kids will turn out to be
[15/07/19, 4:39:34 PM] Sush: ya!!
[15/07/19, 4:39:47 PM] Sush: i have to remind myself not to be resentful of younger people sometimes
[15/07/19, 4:40:00 PM] Sush: of the increased opportunities / awareness they have
[15/07/19, 4:40:16 PM] Sush: sometimes i feel competitive and have to be like no back the f up
[15/07/19, 4:40:53 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Same
[15/07/19, 4:41:02 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Especially with the opportunities around learning
[15/07/19, 4:41:15 PM] Pranathi Chicago: But it's also hard not to compare sometimes and I think it's okay
[15/07/19, 4:41:40 PM] Sush: correct
[15/07/19, 4:41:42 PM] Pranathi Chicago: We're recognizing structural or systemic problems and I think that's fine as long as it's not resentful or covetous towards the people who can have it now
[15/07/19, 4:41:47 PM] Sush: true!
[15/07/19, 4:41:56 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Like with insti
[15/07/19, 4:42:00 PM] Sush: ugh yes
[15/07/19, 4:42:03 PM] Sush: god forbid
[15/07/19, 4:42:04 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I still can't get over how shitty that system was
[15/07/19, 4:42:25 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And that's a problem with *them*, not with the undergrads here who don't even have that frame of reference
[15/07/19, 4:42:36 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I hate insti so much sometimes
[15/07/19, 4:42:48 PM] Sush: i knowwww
[15/07/19, 4:43:08 PM] Sush: i harbour an almost corrosive resentment towards it
[15/07/19, 4:43:29 PM] Sush: need to figure out how to let it go - harming precisely just myself lol
[15/07/19, 4:43:42 PM] Sush: they are happily setting
[15/07/19, 4:43:44 PM] Sush: *sitting
[15/07/19, 4:43:52 PM] Sush: entrenched and content in their mediocrity
[15/07/19, 4:44:15 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah this is true. Maybe offsetting that with the education you had at UChicago? I think of people like Arya Murali
[15/07/19, 4:44:22 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Who have had nothing but insti after
[15/07/19, 4:44:38 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And I think that leaves them in a much more disadvantaged position
[15/07/19, 4:44:52 PM] Pranathi Chicago: So disgusting
[15/07/19, 4:44:54 PM] Sush: true but it's hard not to immediately shift the baseline to people who have had uchicago AND not-insti
[15/07/19, 4:45:32 PM] Sush: i actually have a bit of extra resentment for economics vs DS/eng
[15/07/19, 4:46:13 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Like the way Econ was taught there you mean?
[15/07/19, 4:46:13 PM] Sush: literally not 1 person across like 10 batches of pretty damn smart people was tooled to go into a phd program (in econ or even anything quant) without another degree
[15/07/19, 4:46:42 PM] Sush: unless it was like at IIT bombay which idk if that counts
[15/07/19, 4:46:45 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah so true. It was really such a sham
[15/07/19, 4:46:46 PM] Sush: basically a top 20 program
[15/07/19, 4:47:09 PM] Pranathi Chicago: That's so frustrating
[15/07/19, 4:47:33 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Would you still be interested in getting an Econ PhD?
[15/07/19, 4:47:39 PM] Sush: Nah
[15/07/19, 4:48:07 PM] Sush: I think the moment I discovered other things I realized my interests / curiosities are not aligned really with the questions that econ asks
[15/07/19, 4:49:52 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Haha yeah. Wish I'd had some more of this perspective before I jumped into mine, but I don't feel like it rips me apart in the same way it seems to does P
[15/07/19, 4:50:19 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I am like 70% on board with sociology, which is not a terrible place to be at
[15/07/19, 4:50:45 PM] Sush: that's a pretty great place to be at!
[15/07/19, 4:51:26 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah for sure
[15/07/19, 4:51:50 PM] Sush: i  think i feel that way with 'data science' in general
[15/07/19, 4:52:08 PM] Sush: like i think it has room for the things i want to do
[15/07/19, 4:52:32 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I think that's a really good thing to know
[15/07/19, 4:52:41 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Like where in the world you can see yourself fitting
[15/07/19, 4:53:42 PM] Pranathi Chicago: In other news, I really like the word "chutzpah"
[15/07/19, 4:53:47 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I want to be described as someone with chutzpah
[15/07/19, 4:55:34 PM] Sush: ok i will say at your birthday party next year
[15/07/19, 4:55:39 PM] Sush: donezo
[15/07/19, 4:55:53 PM] Pranathi Chicago: You can say now also
[15/07/19, 4:55:55 PM] Pranathi Chicago: :D
[15/07/19, 4:56:05 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Why wait until next yeeeear
[15/07/19, 4:56:20 PM] Sush: ok next time i post a story of you i will say 'it is having chutzpah'
[15/07/19, 4:56:43 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Hahaha
[15/07/19, 4:56:46 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Okay thank you
[15/07/19, 4:56:49 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I will appreciate it v much
[15/07/19, 4:57:00 PM] Pranathi Chicago: It rolls off the tongue so nicely
[15/07/19, 4:57:05 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I am saying loudly loudly in my apartment
‚Äé[15/07/19, 4:57:06 PM] Sush: ‚ÄéGIF omitted
[15/07/19, 4:57:21 PM] Sush: she is also having tbh
[15/07/19, 4:57:25 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Hahaha exactly like this lady with the chutzpah
[15/07/19, 4:57:32 PM] Sush: üòÇüòÇüòÇ
[15/07/19, 4:57:33 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I want to shake my boobs like that
[15/07/19, 4:57:34 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I am doing
[15/07/19, 4:57:41 PM] Sush: omg i also did 2 jiggles

[15/07/19, 4:58:25 PM] Sush: two two
[15/07/19, 4:58:28 PM] Pranathi Chicago: You think anyone else in Chicago is also jiggling simultaneously?
[15/07/19, 4:58:31 PM] Sush: dude
[15/07/19, 4:58:55 PM] Sush: andy and erin both told me last week that i write code like a WHIZ
[15/07/19, 4:59:04 PM] Sush: they are just impressed by keyboard shortcuts tbh
[15/07/19, 4:59:13 PM] Sush: but i was like üëªüëªüëª
[15/07/19, 4:59:16 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Hahaha I think you should own that compliment
[15/07/19, 4:59:20 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Because you are a WHIZ
[15/07/19, 4:59:28 PM] Pranathi Chicago: My little star whizzy friend
[15/07/19, 4:59:29 PM] Sush: sushmita whiz gopalan

[15/07/19, 4:59:48 PM] Sush: if i become a visualizer i can be viz gopalan
[15/07/19, 4:59:55 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Seems to go seamlessly with your name
[15/07/19, 5:00:03 PM] Sush: no???
[15/07/19, 5:00:04 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Lol you've been spending too much time with sneha
[15/07/19, 5:00:08 PM] Sush: chetana would say sushmita very good
[15/07/19, 5:00:13 PM] Sush: i think that is correct but

[15/07/19, 5:01:01 PM] Sush: literally i feel tears welling up
[15/07/19, 5:01:21 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Omg I can't believe you share a birthday with him
[15/07/19, 5:01:38 PM] Pranathi Chicago: But like I said, I share a birthday with this coked up druggie who dropped out of my cohort called Aron Milberg
[15/07/19, 5:01:46 PM] Pranathi Chicago: It proves to me that this horoscope stuff is false
[15/07/19, 5:02:20 PM] Sush: üòÇ
[15/07/19, 5:02:27 PM] Sush: he still sounds cooler than seshasayee

[15/07/19, 5:02:39 PM] Sush: who this
[15/07/19, 5:02:54 PM] Pranathi Chicago: He's always really hot and sweaty. Every time I see him (he's always at the Cove now), he's so red from being sweaty and gross
[15/07/19, 5:02:59 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Some rando ya
[15/07/19, 5:03:03 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Some boy called Jason

[15/07/19, 5:04:05 PM] Pranathi Chicago: But hopefully he won't be a bro
[15/07/19, 5:04:06 PM] Sush: cute!
[15/07/19, 5:04:08 PM] Sush: yaaaa

[15/07/19, 5:04:17 PM] Sush: well, you'll find out!
[15/07/19, 5:04:26 PM] Pranathi Chicago: If he uses both "fitness" and "nerdy" in one sentence
[15/07/19, 5:04:33 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I hate people who proclaim themselves as nerds
[15/07/19, 5:04:35 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Like, let other people say
[15/07/19, 5:04:40 PM] Sush: i knowww
[15/07/19, 5:04:43 PM] Sush: it's so lame
[15/07/19, 5:04:48 PM] Sush: i'm like u must be actually dumb
[15/07/19, 5:04:53 PM] Sush: u wish u were a nerd
[15/07/19, 5:04:55 PM] Sush: sit down sis
[15/07/19, 5:05:44 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah exactly
[15/07/19, 5:05:56 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Just because you work all the time doesn't make you a nerd

[15/07/19, 5:15:48 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I feel they would not have any problems with that

[16/07/19, 7:05:43 PM] Pranathi Chicago: They just want to take revenge outrage
[16/07/19, 7:06:00 PM] Pranathi Chicago: What they REALLY want to say is that they have diffident white liberal guilt
[16/07/19, 7:06:06 PM] Sush: seriously!
[16/07/19, 7:06:28 PM] Pranathi Chicago: White people are so indistinguishable dude

[16/07/19, 10:19:06 PM] Sush: SLI
[16/07/19, 10:19:10 PM] Pranathi Chicago: That she's too tired of this program

[16/07/19, 10:19:50 PM] Pranathi Chicago: She told her to her face that the program made her feel like she was doing pointless work it seems

[16/07/19, 10:20:54 PM] Sush: ofc we‚Äôd have been viciously taken down for it immediately

[16/07/19, 10:21:02 PM] Pranathi Chicago: So terrifying, the very thought
[16/07/19, 10:21:18 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Also I think half the reason I'm so outraged is because this programme is actually soooo good
[16/07/19, 10:21:32 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I would've benefited so much if I had a course like this in undergrad
[16/07/19, 10:21:43 PM] Sush: What a BRAT

[24/07/19, 2:45:42 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Easy to romanticize someone when they're like half a world away except when they have cushy, dreamy vacations

[27/07/19, 6:33:23 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Hi friend. Sorry I went off to sleep. I think some combination of overeating and the heat and the crowd and going to bed late put me in a super sleepy situation
[27/07/19, 9:16:13 PM] Sush: No worriesss
[27/07/19, 9:21:56 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Are you suuuure?
[27/07/19, 11:17:27 PM] Sush: yessss
[28/07/19, 11:59:57 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Hi friend. Maybe you're just busy, but I get this feeling that there's some distance suddenly, and I just wanted to check in. If I've upset you in some way, I hope you'd tell me so we can talk about it. If it's something else that has nothing to do with me, then I'll give space unless you want to talk.
[28/07/19, 12:01:36 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I know we were only talking about breakfast today tentatively but I'm a little confused whether you didn't want to or something else came up?

[29/07/19, 9:34:31 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Could just be me being paranoid tho
[29/07/19, 9:34:42 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Ughhh and it's such a depressing rainy kind of morning!
[29/07/19, 1:11:15 PM] Sush: you're probably fine! see for a few more days
[29/07/19, 1:11:26 PM] Sush: sorry, my monday mornings are full of meetings

[29/07/19, 4:24:26 PM] Sush: peace of mind
[29/07/19, 4:24:27 PM] Pranathi Chicago: It's normal to not get it on the pill
[29/07/19, 4:24:40 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah it was worth it, I was chumma hyperventilating
[29/07/19, 4:25:08 PM] Sush: :)

[29/07/19, 4:27:16 PM] Sush: full of natural light
[29/07/19, 4:27:17 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Oh yeah, Bindu's friend Hannah runs that cafe
[29/07/19, 4:27:25 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Ooh. I've heard of that place
[29/07/19, 4:27:34 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Who's the guy associated with it again?
[29/07/19, 4:27:39 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I think Forrest worked with them too
[29/07/19, 4:27:43 PM] Sush: jamie kalven
[29/07/19, 4:28:02 PM] Sush: ohh that would make sense
[29/07/19, 4:28:13 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Oh doesn't ring a bell. Wish you were in Hp still
[29/07/19, 4:28:18 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I'd love to do lake time with you
[29/07/19, 4:28:26 PM] Sush: i knowwww
[29/07/19, 4:28:38 PM] Sush: i went to the lake the last three days
[29/07/19, 4:28:43 PM] Sush: and thought about the point a lot
[29/07/19, 4:28:49 PM] Sush: although i do like these beaches too!
[29/07/19, 4:29:04 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah you have a nice beach
[29/07/19, 4:29:11 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I was thinking of going to the lake for a bit now
[29/07/19, 4:29:31 PM] Sush: i don't think it's going to rain again also
[29/07/19, 4:30:38 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah. I'm just feeling mopey today lol
[29/07/19, 4:30:53 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I worked in the morning and then went to therapy and I'm feeling done.
[29/07/19, 4:31:13 PM] Sush: ayy i'm sorry love!
[29/07/19, 4:31:13 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Mike asked if I'd like to see a show this week and I said okay, which day was he thinking and then he said he doesn't know what's going on this week and he'll keep an eye out
[29/07/19, 4:31:36 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Which is a little annoying because I want to see him but I also want to plan other things so I'm not sitting around waiting for him
[29/07/19, 4:31:53 PM] Sush: yeah plan off other things!
[29/07/19, 4:33:46 PM] Sush: otherwise you'll feel resentful
[29/07/19, 4:33:59 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yes correct
[29/07/19, 4:34:08 PM] Pranathi Chicago: You think he's trying to get with me or blow me off?
[29/07/19, 4:34:09 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I can't figure him out
[29/07/19, 4:34:24 PM] Sush: honestly, i think neither
[29/07/19, 4:34:55 PM] Sush: i think he wants you to be in each other's lives - in the only he has the bandwidth for rn
[29/07/19, 4:35:19 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah you're right
[29/07/19, 4:35:24 PM] Sush: *only way
[29/07/19, 4:35:49 PM] Sush: he is clearly ‚ù§ing you but can't do much about it
[29/07/19, 4:36:13 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Because anxiety?
[29/07/19, 4:36:24 PM] Sush: because preoccupied
[29/07/19, 4:36:42 PM] Sush: intertwined with anxiety probably
[29/07/19, 4:37:16 PM] Sush: feeling inadequate while having anxiety is an all-consuming activity
[29/07/19, 4:38:42 PM] Pranathi Chicago: yeah that's true. Thanks for explaining to me ‚ù§
[29/07/19, 4:39:06 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I feel so lame for wanting this so badly
[29/07/19, 4:39:25 PM] Sush: it's not lame at all!
[29/07/19, 4:39:59 PM] Sush: it's infuriating and feels unfair that something we want is dictated by things that have nothing to do with us also
[29/07/19, 4:40:37 PM] Sush: connections are so rare also - it's sooo understandable you're feeling this way
[29/07/19, 4:41:02 PM] Pranathi Chicago: :(((( Sorry for going on and on about this
[29/07/19, 4:41:10 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I feel like I talk about it endlessly lol
[29/07/19, 4:41:22 PM] Sush: don't apologize!
[29/07/19, 4:41:46 PM] Sush: if it's on your mind, it's on your mind!
[29/07/19, 4:52:49 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah, feeling connection is so rare and I know it's going to be so long before I find someone else I connect with again
[29/07/19, 4:53:15 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Oh well, I guess it's better he figures out his stuff instead of me trying to actively chase someone who can't be with me
[29/07/19, 4:54:52 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I think I'm going to take myself to a movie at Gene Siskel tonight
[29/07/19, 4:55:42 PM] Pranathi Chicago: There's a movie directed by Ralph Fiennes about a ballet dancer who moves from the Soviet to Paris and it seems interesting

[02/08/19, 11:38:58 AM] Pranathi Chicago: And she aggravated me with her response. She was like
[02/08/19, 11:39:27 AM] Pranathi Chicago: He's not your boyfriend and he can't give you emotional support. And you can't have a boyfriend now so you have to accept the circumstances and be a badass single lady
[02/08/19, 11:39:45 AM] Sush: omg why is she so conservative
[02/08/19, 11:39:46 AM] Pranathi Chicago: No shit Sherlock, also easy for you to say lol

[02/08/19, 11:40:03 AM] Pranathi Chicago: She can't even be explained to

[08/08/19, 8:59:49 PM] Pranathi Chicago: The universe is so bizarre
[08/08/19, 8:59:54 PM] Sush: Whaaat why is that boy haunting you
[08/08/19, 9:00:08 PM] Sush: Isn‚Äôt that in v poor taste?
[08/08/19, 9:00:13 PM] Sush: Like it‚Äôs not funny
[08/08/19, 9:00:15 PM] Pranathi Chicago: YUCK
[08/08/19, 9:00:19 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I hate that!!
[08/08/19, 9:00:25 PM] Pranathi Chicago: He has no right to talk like that
[08/08/19, 9:00:32 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Also he's a history major?!
[08/08/19, 9:00:36 PM] Sush: Ya!
[08/08/19, 9:00:41 PM] Sush: He got off his PhD also
[08/08/19, 9:00:43 PM] Sush: Done
[08/08/19, 9:00:44 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Like how does he not realize?
[08/08/19, 9:00:54 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Dude it was the most bizarre thing
[08/08/19, 9:00:59 PM] Sush: I don‚Äôt even feel like replying
[08/08/19, 9:01:10 PM] Pranathi Chicago: He came over and talked to me
[08/08/19, 9:01:16 PM] Sush: What it seems
[08/08/19, 9:01:31 PM] Pranathi Chicago: He asked if I want to see a shoe
[08/08/19, 9:01:33 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Show
[08/08/19, 9:01:43 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And then he went swimming and made intense eye contact with me from the water
[08/08/19, 9:01:49 PM] Pranathi Chicago: He is the most confusing person I know
[08/08/19, 9:01:55 PM] Sush: Wtf
[08/08/19, 9:02:04 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And Andrew said he was flirting with me
[08/08/19, 9:02:18 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Like he was smiling a lot and asking about dumb shit
[08/08/19, 9:02:27 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Am I crazy?
[08/08/19, 9:02:27 PM] Sush: Not confusing this is textbook fuckboi
[08/08/19, 9:03:08 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah it's not worth it. You don't want to spend time just worrying he'll say something fucked up again
[08/08/19, 9:03:23 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah. :/ What does he want
[08/08/19, 9:03:43 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I'm not going to text him, not until Rebecca leaves anyway
[08/08/19, 9:03:48 PM] Pranathi Chicago: She's staying with me this weekend
[08/08/19, 9:03:50 PM] Sush: I mean, I won‚Äôt - I‚Äôm fairly indifferent. I‚Äôm just irritated
[08/08/19, 9:03:55 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Because Timna is going out of town
[08/08/19, 9:04:09 PM] Sush: Ya just take the time off this weekend!
[08/08/19, 9:04:12 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Sorry, didn't mean to imply that you would.
[08/08/19, 9:04:28 PM] Sush: You deserve to have time without him fucking with it
[08/08/19, 9:04:35 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I was just concurring that the boy seems incredibly rude and oblivious
[08/08/19, 9:04:55 PM] Sush: Haan haan I know I didn‚Äôt take offence or anything!!
[08/08/19, 9:05:01 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah I'm just going to cancel him for a bit. It'll make me feel a little more in control also
[08/08/19, 9:05:08 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Oh ok ok üíï
[08/08/19, 9:05:14 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Today this Andrew said I was socially weird
[08/08/19, 9:05:26 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And now it has me second guessing everything I am doing
[08/08/19, 9:05:30 PM] Sush: What is all this normative rubbish
[08/08/19, 9:05:37 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I thought that was kind of a rude thing to say
[08/08/19, 9:05:46 PM] Sush: That is rude and normative
[08/08/19, 9:05:47 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Like we're all socially weird to someone
[08/08/19, 9:05:55 PM] Sush: Who is he to arbitrate
[08/08/19, 9:06:12 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And I feel like if I have an opinion about my own fieldwork, it has nothing to do with him
[08/08/19, 9:06:19 PM] Pranathi Chicago: He asked me if I'm excited about fieldwork
[08/08/19, 9:06:31 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And I said yes but also nervous and I am scared about leaving my friends
[08/08/19, 9:06:58 PM] Pranathi Chicago: He said that that was a little negative thinking and that it was socially weird I would frame it like that when I got a grant and it's a good opportunity
[08/08/19, 9:07:19 PM] Sush: What is socially weird even
[08/08/19, 9:07:29 PM] Pranathi Chicago: It's like saying "you are not supposed to feel how you feel, because to me this is not something to be sad about"
[08/08/19, 9:07:44 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Which is so normative and he would never move out of his fucking white comfort zone
[08/08/19, 9:07:55 PM] Sush: Ya like who asked for his permission to have feelings
[08/08/19, 9:07:59 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Also look at this girl Karlyn's post
[08/08/19, 9:08:07 PM] Pranathi Chicago: This is the girl who he hearts
[08/08/19, 9:08:11 PM] Sush: Single woman?
[08/08/19, 9:08:13 PM] Sush: Lol

‚Äé[08/08/19, 9:08:48 PM] Sush: ‚Äéimage omitted
[08/08/19, 9:08:48 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Who shows off like that about buying a house on Facebook? Who isn't 40 years old lol
[08/08/19, 9:09:01 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Onggg you follow her?
[08/08/19, 9:09:14 PM] Sush: Ya she asked for my handle at your birthday
[08/08/19, 9:09:21 PM] Sush: So I followed her also
[08/08/19, 9:09:25 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Lolol isn't she so excessive on Insta
[08/08/19, 9:09:32 PM] Sush: Tired ass white feminism
[08/08/19, 9:09:50 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah it's almost a joke how unironic she is
[08/08/19, 9:10:08 PM] Sush: She‚Äôs reminding me a bit of Maddie
[08/08/19, 9:10:33 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Oh wow really?
[08/08/19, 9:10:40 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Karlyn is one of the most annoying people I know
[08/08/19, 9:10:45 PM] Sush: Same sort of trite feminism
[08/08/19, 9:10:50 PM] Sush: Maddie is probably nicer
[08/08/19, 9:11:02 PM] Sush: With fewer rough edges
[08/08/19, 9:11:06 PM] Sush: She‚Äôs quite personable
[08/08/19, 9:11:16 PM] Sush: She and I have no idea how to talk to each other tho
[09/08/19, 7:51:26 PM] Sush: Hey friend how are you?
[10/08/19, 8:30:51 AM] Pranathi Chicago: Hi friend, Rebecca is staying with me this weekend
[10/08/19, 8:31:10 AM] Pranathi Chicago: So we went out last night when you'd texted and I proceeded to get very smashed and threw up üôà
[10/08/19, 8:31:15 AM] Pranathi Chicago: How are you doing?
[10/08/19, 5:45:06 PM] Sush: Haha Ayyo! was it fun?
[10/08/19, 5:45:18 PM] Sush: I‚Äôm just trying to ride out this soreness tbh
[10/08/19, 5:45:23 PM] Sush: Came to the beach with Joanna

[11/08/19, 11:05:30 PM] Pranathi Chicago: This ice tsunami thing is stunning and terrifying at the same time
[11/08/19, 11:05:36 PM] Sush: right?!
[11/08/19, 11:05:46 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Wowow
[12/08/19, 1:25:11 PM] Sush: dudeee
[12/08/19, 1:25:32 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Hiii
[12/08/19, 1:25:53 PM] Pranathi Chicago: What's up friend!
[12/08/19, 1:26:56 PM] Sush: ‚ÄéYou deleted this message.
[12/08/19, 1:27:07 PM] Sush: because this thing has really been dragging
[12/08/19, 1:27:12 PM] Sush: she _freaked out_
[12/08/19, 1:27:13 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Push E?
[12/08/19, 1:27:16 PM] Sush: ‚ÄéYou deleted this message.
[12/08/19, 1:27:19 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Ohhh
[12/08/19, 1:27:26 PM] Pranathi Chicago: What happened when you told her?
[12/08/19, 1:27:33 PM] Sush: like, hyperventilating
[12/08/19, 1:27:41 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Oh shit.
[12/08/19, 1:27:51 PM] Pranathi Chicago: About falling behind?
[12/08/19, 1:27:51 PM] Sush: i feel really bad but also like, impatient
[12/08/19, 1:28:04 PM] Sush: she was fixing some elaborate thing
[12/08/19, 1:28:10 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah, that's fair. You shouldn't have to nanny her
[12/08/19, 1:28:13 PM] Sush: and i said well we don't need that to work right now
[12/08/19, 1:28:47 PM] Sush: i've been trying to give her aggregate data so she won't spent 1000 hours aggregating it
[12/08/19, 1:28:54 PM] Sush: but that strategy didn't work
[12/08/19, 1:29:08 PM] Sush: andy's putting a lot of pressure on me
[12/08/19, 1:29:18 PM] Sush: i said andy's anxious to see some preliminary results
[12/08/19, 1:29:24 PM] Sush: and i think that freaked her out
[12/08/19, 1:29:29 PM] Sush: maybe i shouldn't have said that
[12/08/19, 1:29:35 PM] Sush: but idk, it's a workplace
[12/08/19, 1:29:49 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah just cause your friends doesn't mean you have to coddle her
[12/08/19, 1:29:55 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And you were literally following orders from him
[12/08/19, 1:30:09 PM] Sush: i don't want to manage her project!
[12/08/19, 1:30:12 PM] Sush: we are too close IRL
[12/08/19, 1:30:32 PM] Sush: and she's one of my closest friends - i don't want to jeopardize that
[12/08/19, 1:30:51 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I can get why she's anxious based on everything you've told me about her, but let her process it and maybe have a conversation outside work about it. Say you were put in the position because of work, but that you appreciate her friendship
[12/08/19, 1:31:38 PM] Pranathi Chicago: But also that you can't back down because work is work. Put it on Andy, I'm sure he wouldn't be offended
[12/08/19, 1:31:47 PM] Pranathi Chicago: It's also the truth
[12/08/19, 1:33:58 PM] Sush: yeah
[12/08/19, 1:34:11 PM] Sush: and also like some basic questions shouldn't be this stressful, no?
[12/08/19, 1:34:38 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah, and she's feeling probably less competent or whatever
[12/08/19, 1:34:41 PM] Sush: now she's going to spiral all week
[12/08/19, 1:34:42 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Which has always been her insecurity
[12/08/19, 1:34:54 PM] Sush: i feel horrible!
[12/08/19, 1:34:59 PM] Pranathi Chicago: But it's not on you to coddle her in this situation
[12/08/19, 1:35:03 PM] Sush: (and slightly irritated)
[12/08/19, 1:35:07 PM] Sush: true :(
[12/08/19, 1:35:15 PM] Pranathi Chicago: If it weren't you in this position, someone else would've told her
[12/08/19, 1:35:25 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And she's going to get this a lot unfortunately :(
[12/08/19, 1:35:29 PM] Sush: andy's treating her with kid gloves
[12/08/19, 1:35:46 PM] Sush: and is telling me to push
[12/08/19, 1:35:52 PM] Sush: how will i push YOU push
[12/08/19, 1:36:09 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Maybe it's good to tell him also about the weird situation that puts you in
[12/08/19, 1:36:18 PM] Pranathi Chicago: You're her friend and you were in the same program, same year
[12/08/19, 1:36:25 PM] Sush: yeah, i brought that up last week
[12/08/19, 1:36:30 PM] Sush: did i overstep today?
[12/08/19, 1:36:31 PM] Sush: idk
[12/08/19, 1:36:39 PM] Sush: i should've set a time to talk to her about it
[12/08/19, 1:36:51 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Don't doubt yourself. It's hard to work with friends
[12/08/19, 1:37:13 PM] Pranathi Chicago: And sometimes you have to make decisions that will make things complicated, but I think she'll appreciate the position you're in too
[12/08/19, 1:37:28 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Just give her some time to process it all
[12/08/19, 1:37:57 PM] Pranathi Chicago: She probably can't come to you with those insecurities now, but she seems wonderful based on everything you've said
[12/08/19, 1:38:38 PM] Sush: Yeah :(
[12/08/19, 1:38:43 PM] Sush: I do love her so much
[12/08/19, 1:39:25 PM] Sush: she's insisting on doing a thing again
[12/08/19, 1:39:34 PM] Sush: i can't say much beyond a point
[12/08/19, 1:39:56 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Yeah, just let her do what she's doing and tell Andy that you can't be pushing her
[12/08/19, 1:40:09 PM] Pranathi Chicago: It will be way too hard to be managing her and also be her friend
[12/08/19, 1:40:26 PM] Sush: Yeah, I'd really rather just be her friend
[12/08/19, 1:40:34 PM] Pranathi Chicago: It's a hard position to be in, I'm sorry :(
[12/08/19, 1:57:54 PM] Sush: ok she's calmer
[12/08/19, 1:58:00 PM] Sush: and she has therapy this afternoon phew
[12/08/19, 1:58:16 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Oh good!
[12/08/19, 1:58:35 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Want to still meet for dinner today?
[12/08/19, 1:59:21 PM] Sush: I think I'm having too much pain friend :(
[12/08/19, 1:59:31 PM] Sush: all i'm thinking about is going home to my ice pack
[12/08/19, 2:17:46 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Okay, makes total sense!
[12/08/19, 2:17:52 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Please feel better love üíï
[12/08/19, 2:43:03 PM] Sush: how is tomorrow?
[12/08/19, 2:44:08 PM] Pranathi Chicago: I have panels for the presentations tomorrow and day after but maybe after the panel on Wednesday night?
[12/08/19, 2:44:12 PM] Pranathi Chicago: It'll get done at 7:30
[12/08/19, 2:44:35 PM] Sush: yeah! i have R-Ladies on Wednesday - it'll finish around that time
[12/08/19, 2:44:49 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Okay maybe we can meet downtown for drinks
[12/08/19, 2:44:56 PM] Sush: yess i like that
[12/08/19, 2:45:07 PM] Pranathi Chicago: Okay sounds gooood üíï
[12/08/19, 8:08:21 PM] Sush: Sis!
