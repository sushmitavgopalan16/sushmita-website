[12/12/17, 12:49:13 AM] Didige: Existential mornings?
[12/12/17, 12:49:20 AM] Sush: Our generation is both v lucky to not have it and condemned by not having it
[12/12/17, 12:50:04 AM] Didige: Yaaa imagine we had 'settled' by now

[12/12/17, 1:18:58 AM] Didige: Means You want clarity ?
[12/12/17, 2:35:58 AM] Sush: Means I struggle a lot with feeling centred often
[12/12/17, 2:36:19 AM] Sush: Like I don't have a sense of a home
[12/12/17, 2:36:32 AM] Sush: I often feel adrift and afloat

[12/12/17, 2:37:58 AM] Didige: What is your definition of home
[12/12/17, 2:38:19 AM] Didige: Not what is home to you since you're saying you don't feel a home.
[12/12/17, 2:38:27 AM] Didige: Start from what do you think is home
[12/12/17, 2:38:55 AM] Sush: I guess part of this is grad school also - I have been 'on my way' somewhere for many years now
[12/12/17, 2:39:00 AM] Sush: Since I graduated actually
[12/12/17, 2:39:19 AM] Sush: Been floating from place to place - on my way to something
[12/12/17, 2:39:22 AM] Sush: Which was great
[12/12/17, 2:39:30 AM] Sush: Now I want some stability
[12/12/17, 2:39:44 AM] Sush: That's one of the reasons I want to stay on in Chicago for a bit
[12/12/17, 2:39:51 AM] Didige: Ya I think it's mostly grad school
[12/12/17, 2:40:01 AM] Didige: I think that's a good idea

[18/12/17, 10:34:19 AM] Sush: Lolol
[18/12/17, 10:34:24 AM] Sush: Job portal
[18/12/17, 10:35:19 AM] Didige: I know and I am not disregarding the feelings you had for him . I never did . You kept thinking I did.
[18/12/17, 10:35:46 AM] Sush: I guess I did think that sometimes
[19/12/17, 6:58:03 AM] Sush: You're thinking I'm making you Gillian?
[19/12/17, 6:58:06 AM] Sush: Villain
[19/12/17, 6:59:31 AM] Sush: Not making villain but the general history of our interactions re: mikhail makes me a bit defensive of my feelings about it. I'm sure part of it lost in translation also - I don't hold it against you but it's panned out this way for some reason
[19/12/17, 7:37:13 AM] Didige: History of our interactions ante?
[19/12/17, 7:49:44 AM] Sush: means our conversations about him
[19/12/17, 8:05:46 AM] Didige: I never dismissed when you told me about Mikhail no?
[19/12/17, 8:08:53 AM] Sush: You didn't dismiss _me_ but you were a bit dismissive about the situation in general - which makes me feel the need to bring up the fact that it was v real for me when I feel like you're not hearing that
[19/12/17, 8:09:48 AM] Sush: I get _why_ you saw the situation like you did - it was hard to see where I was coming from, from where you were looking at it for sure.
[19/12/17, 8:10:47 AM] Sush: Like sometimes I feel the need to bring it up to make you understand where I'm at. Like I said this isn't anyone's fault, it's just how it is
[19/12/17, 8:11:24 AM] Sush: It's not that I think you're a monster - I'm being extra explicit to make sure I'm communicating clearly
[19/12/17, 8:16:08 AM] Didige: I am not saying anyone was at fault either. And I wasn't dismissive about the situation either . I didn't fully understand it also considering our physical distance etc. And you were quite confused about how to work out it too, so yes some was lost in translation .And that's fine , it happens . I don't know . It felt like you thought I was unapproachable or something.
[19/12/17, 8:31:16 AM] Sush: No I didn't think you were unapproachable! I just used whatever coping mechanism I had at that point
[19/12/17, 8:31:31 AM] Sush: :)

[04/02/18, 3:54:26 PM] Didige: They act like they are doing something
[04/02/18, 3:55:55 PM] Didige: Like I see arya once in a while . and she's embraced not doing anything. Helping her husband with his career etc but like she won't judge me because I am working
[04/02/18, 3:57:13 PM] Didige: Vaish actually looked at me once with sympathy because I was tired (from a 14 hour day) and said Didige you are working on new years too ? I said yaa biggest night Baap . She gave me you poor thing eyes -_-

[04/02/18, 4:01:59 PM] Didige: Like who are we to say everyone should make something
[04/02/18, 4:02:01 PM] Didige: Idk
[04/02/18, 4:02:00 PM] Sush: Like I think we have an obligation to contribute or whatever
[04/02/18, 4:02:16 PM] Sush: to something, anything
[04/02/18, 4:02:22 PM] Didige: Do weee? Where is this obligation coming from for what
[04/02/18, 4:02:27 PM] Sush: Mostly I don’t understand how they’re satisfied
[04/02/18, 4:02:45 PM] Didige: Like I feel the need etc but I am just like if they're not feeling means kya karna
[04/02/18, 4:02:52 PM] Didige: Ya I agrre

[04/02/18, 4:24:50 PM] Didige: To get to know husband and make babies. Like they have to raise babies and look good and keep up with the society's expectations of their fam. I.e take care of husband
[04/02/18, 4:25:39 PM] Didige: I know I know I am cringing too. But like they are helping put a family together no?
[04/02/18, 4:25:50 PM] Didige: And move forward
[04/02/18, 4:26:27 PM] Didige: I've always wondered what feminism if I am judging women who are chosing to be housewives
[04/02/18, 4:26:32 PM] Didige: Uggh
[04/02/18, 4:26:55 PM] Didige: I am clearly having existential 4 am Sunday so you can reply at your own pace
[04/02/18, 4:38:38 PM] Sush: yaa my mom was saying another thing - like if vaish does some job she doesn't give a fuck about just for the sake of it
[04/02/18, 4:38:50 PM] Sush: she's preventing someone who cares / needs it from doing it
[05/02/18, 3:03:49 AM] Didige: Haan that also
[05/02/18, 11:25:31 AM] Sush: I’m not sure how much I buy that though
[05/02/18, 11:25:50 AM] Sush: Everyone has a right to work if they can establish that they’re the right man for the job
[05/02/18, 11:26:18 AM] Sush: But I guess half assing + don’t need << need + want

[15/02/18, 12:06:22 AM] Sush: like no need to be over formal
[15/02/18, 12:06:26 AM] Sush: but basic respect!!!
[15/02/18, 12:07:32 AM] Sush: it's quite frustrating
[15/02/18, 4:32:30 AM] Didige: Aeeee
[15/02/18, 4:32:35 AM] Didige: Hate that
[15/02/18, 4:33:02 AM] Didige: And I think more than saying it , it's the approach to the actions or words they are doing or sayin
[15/02/18, 4:33:14 AM] Didige: Just got to show them their place and also rise above
[15/02/18, 7:57:38 AM] Sush: It also feels gendered and v uncomfortable
[15/02/18, 7:57:57 AM] Sush: and the thing is ultimately I end up doing way more work because my grade is on the line
[15/02/18, 8:24:41 AM] Sush: Like yesterday he said ‘the part you did is way longer than the part I did’
[15/02/18, 8:25:00 AM] Sush: but no thank you or like, whoaaa nice work
[15/02/18, 8:25:14 AM] Sush: or even next week I’ll do off more
[15/02/18, 8:25:35 AM] Sush: So it makes me feel like he can’t BRING himself to say please and thank you?
[15/02/18, 8:25:48 AM] Sush: Or even he’ll say ‘need your help with this’
[15/02/18, 8:26:00 AM] Sush: I want to reply with ‘that’s not a question’
[15/02/18, 10:43:35 PM] Sush: diggs

[16/02/18, 2:16:56 AM] Didige: And don't expect for nice work , thank you etc . He clearly isn't someone who is capable of it . We must not bring our energy towards work down because of douches like these
[16/02/18, 2:17:14 AM] Didige: I guess when you don't have that expectation  it makes things easier no?
[16/02/18, 9:01:43 AM] Sush: Yesterday I pinged for different reason sdtuallyyy

[19/02/18, 1:27:00 AM] Sush: This boy was damn sweet
[19/02/18, 1:27:34 AM] Sush: I said I’m not in a place to date but I had a really nice time and would love to be friends if you’re comfortable with that
[19/02/18, 1:27:40 AM] Sush: he said was something wrong
[19/02/18, 1:28:01 AM] Sush: I said no I just thought I was ready after my last relationship but I’m not
[19/02/18, 1:28:29 AM] Sush: and he said sure I understand, I’d still consider you a friend if we don’t date
[19/02/18, 1:28:54 AM] Sush: and he said I still really liked kissing you last night so let me know if you ever change your mind
[19/02/18, 1:50:51 AM] Didige: Ohhooo how lovely !
[19/02/18, 1:51:03 AM] Didige: Handled very smoothly :)
[19/02/18, 1:51:11 AM] Didige: Both of you
[19/02/18, 1:51:20 AM] Didige: Plizz to not friend zone him
[19/02/18, 7:37:05 AM] Sush: What do you actually mean by friend zone?
[19/02/18, 7:44:17 AM] Didige: Means you went on 2 dates with him . You've kissed him . And when you told him you're not in a place for a relationship he said yes I'd like to be friends but let me know if you change your mind .
[19/02/18, 7:45:31 AM] Didige: So he is attracted to you and is hoping you'll change your mind . You will like the subtlety of the attention he come with
[19/02/18, 7:46:21 AM] Sush: I actually think it’s possible for two people to explore the idea of something romantic / sexual and then change their minds and be friends
[19/02/18, 7:46:47 AM] Didige: Ya except he hasn't no?
[19/02/18, 7:47:12 AM] Sush: like, I have a problem with this idea if someone is being nice to you after you’ve told them you’re not interested in being involved with them - you owe them feelings in return for their niceness
[19/02/18, 7:47:54 AM] Didige: What?
[19/02/18, 7:47:57 AM] Didige: I am confused

[26/03/18, 3:45:34 PM] Didige: is
[26/03/18, 3:45:58 PM] Sush: i mean, they wouldn't have sold it to amazon if it wasn't profitable to them
[26/03/18, 3:45:59 PM] Didige: Anyway yesss I am excite . Currently on the struggle to change my sleep cycle back
[26/03/18, 3:47:00 PM] Sush: apparently it was sold to amazon for 25 crorw
[26/03/18, 3:47:07 PM] Didige: Ya I guess . It's jussstt films are being watched on phone

[26/03/18, 3:47:29 PM] Sush: https://www.livemint.com/Companies/QDQcsXaeYMXnZS3gJYoZXP/Amazon-Prime-Video-wins-streaming-rights-for-Padmavati.html
[26/03/18, 3:47:55 PM] Sush: but restricting movies to people who can afford to go to theatre is also a bit sad no?
[26/03/18, 3:48:02 PM] Sush: amazon is way more affordable
[26/03/18, 3:49:02 PM] Didige: No but you should release after it's off the theaters no?
[26/03/18, 3:49:28 PM] Sush: yeah i guess that's just business
[26/03/18, 3:49:44 PM] Sush: amazon must have offered significantly more money to get rights earlier
[26/03/18, 3:49:54 PM] Didige: I mean it's called big cinema
[26/03/18, 3:50:15 PM] Didige: Ya this is where cinema becomes business and it's all just

[26/03/18, 3:52:22 PM] Sush: i remember reading this somewhere else also
[26/03/18, 3:52:35 PM] Sush: my point is essentially that this will make filmmakers _more_ money, not less
[26/03/18, 3:53:07 PM] Sush: because netflix, amazon etc are willing to pay huge premiums for films now, no?
[26/03/18, 3:53:15 PM] Sush: ofc i only have layman fundaes
[26/03/18, 3:53:34 PM] Didige: Not it will make producers more money . Whichhhh is not always equivalent to filmmakers making more money
[26/03/18, 3:53:58 PM] Sush: ah fair
[26/03/18, 3:54:39 PM] Didige: Ya it just changes the game and complicates it

[25/05/18, 2:32:08 PM] Sush: Kya sochre?
[25/05/18, 2:32:23 PM] Didige: Sooo I was going to get back to about your situation of staying back for 3 months while you find a job. 


I totally hear on where you are . I think the best route through this is to travel in the States . Essentially Chicago is sorta home now , so if you step out for a bit ,that trapped feeling won't come naa? 

Maybe visit pojo or travel with mom ?
[25/05/18, 2:32:48 PM] Didige: My mom sends many many luck with job apps 👻
[25/05/18, 2:32:55 PM] Sush: yaaa but I literally no money at all
[25/05/18, 2:33:09 PM] Sush: and I really don’t want to ask parents now
[25/05/18, 2:33:15 PM] Didige: Obvs ignore this if you're mood is very good
[25/05/18, 2:33:28 PM] Sush: thankyouuuuu
[25/05/18, 2:33:46 PM] Sush: Like obv my TA job was covering my living expenses
[25/05/18, 2:33:55 PM] Sush: and it was paycheck to paycheck
[25/05/18, 2:33:59 PM] Sush: and they stop now
[25/05/18, 2:34:10 PM] Sush: And I have no savings
[25/05/18, 2:34:19 PM] Sush: I literally don’t have money for flight tickets
[25/05/18, 2:35:05 PM] Sush: so full poverty is happening
[25/05/18, 2:35:52 PM] Didige: You feel it's a burden on them  aa?
[25/05/18, 2:36:01 PM] Sush: ya I think it’ll be
[25/05/18, 2:36:13 PM] Sush: Because they’ve been paying my tuition this year
[25/05/18, 2:36:27 PM] Sush: and basically I might need money for basic stuff later in the summer
[25/05/18, 2:36:36 PM] Didige: Talk to mom about it when she comes?
[25/05/18, 2:36:37 PM] Sush: so I want to keep my quota of asking for that
[25/05/18, 2:36:46 PM] Sush: If I say they’ll send
[25/05/18, 2:36:54 PM] Didige: Like see being a parent off course she'll say no and all that
[25/05/18, 2:36:56 PM] Sush: That’s why I don’t want to
[25/05/18, 2:37:24 PM] Didige: But I am not saying be up front that you want to do this etc .
[25/05/18, 2:37:39 PM] Sush: Basically when I know I’ll probably need to ask for necessities I don’t want to ask for non-necessities
[25/05/18, 2:37:41 PM] Didige: Maybe have a conversation with her and you'll have clarity
[25/05/18, 2:38:09 PM] Sush: esp until I get a job
[25/05/18, 2:38:47 PM] Sush: they have to pay my health insurance also
[25/05/18, 2:38:56 PM] Didige: And I feel like once your mom comes your mood will change on this for as long as she is in Chicago at least
[25/05/18, 2:38:58 PM] Didige: Naa?
[25/05/18, 2:39:03 PM] Didige: How long is she there
[25/05/18, 2:39:10 PM] Sush: She’s here for two weeks
[25/05/18, 2:39:29 PM] Didige: Because all your peers are probably figuring out next step so max pressure
[25/05/18, 2:39:37 PM] Sush: yaaa
[25/05/18, 2:39:54 PM] Sush: It just feels really entitled to ask for fun money at this point
[25/05/18, 2:40:09 PM] Sush: On top of health insurance and rent
[25/05/18, 2:40:29 PM] Didige: I hear youuuu
[25/05/18, 2:40:30 PM] Sush: idk
[25/05/18, 2:40:36 PM] Sush: Maybe if it reaaalllyyyy gets to me
[25/05/18, 2:40:44 PM] Didige: Just wait till she comes da
[25/05/18, 2:40:50 PM] Sush: but now I’m trying to be like summerfunnnnn
[25/05/18, 2:40:54 PM] Sush: Just go read by the lake
[25/05/18, 2:40:56 PM] Sush: And swim
[25/05/18, 2:40:58 PM] Sush: And run
[25/05/18, 2:41:01 PM] Didige: Hauuuuuu
[25/05/18, 2:41:06 PM] Didige: Summer summer
[25/05/18, 2:41:23 PM] Sush: and if I have to leave Chicago, soak up chicago summer
[25/05/18, 2:41:24 PM] Didige: I remember how much it changed your mood last year. For obvious reasons
[25/05/18, 2:41:30 PM] Sush: Travel is so expensive also
[25/05/18, 2:41:31 PM] Didige: Yessssss
[25/05/18, 2:41:52 PM] Sush: Like I literally have to use my credit card to make rent this month
[25/05/18, 2:41:57 PM] Sush: 😅
[25/05/18, 2:42:05 PM] Sush: studentlyf doesn’t let you save
[25/05/18, 2:42:11 PM] Sush: So when income stops it’s like errrrr
[25/05/18, 2:42:33 PM] Didige: Just take a one way train to bostom
[25/05/18, 2:42:37 PM] Didige: Boston

[10/07/18, 5:14:27 PM] Didige: I told puff to watch it
[10/07/18, 5:14:30 PM] Sush: I wish the dubbing wasn’t in American accent
[10/07/18, 5:14:34 PM] Didige: Just casually told her
[10/07/18, 5:15:08 PM] Sush: like I think it might have been better if they’d had native Spanish speakers dub in English
[10/07/18, 5:15:20 PM] Sush: All the women sound the same :P
[10/07/18, 5:17:12 PM] Didige: What I don't get is why the fuck the soundtrack is in english
[10/07/18, 5:17:20 PM] Sush: omg YES

[10/07/18, 5:21:25 PM] Didige: I don't think it's dubbing though
[10/07/18, 5:21:30 PM] Didige: It's sync sound I think
[10/07/18, 5:21:37 PM] Didige: Anddd I just looked
[10/07/18, 5:21:50 PM] Sush: acha what’s the difference?
[10/07/18, 5:22:29 PM] Didige: They areee native Spanish speakers
[10/07/18, 5:22:38 PM] Didige: Kya Yaar Pura neend uda diya
[10/07/18, 5:22:43 PM] Sush: ohhhh
[10/07/18, 5:22:46 PM] Sush: lol sorrryyy
[10/07/18, 5:22:48 PM] Didige: So dubbing is when you do sound after
[10/07/18, 5:23:17 PM] Didige: And sync sound is when you film and record sound on location
[10/07/18, 5:23:27 PM] Sush: Ohh ok ok
[10/07/18, 5:23:29 PM] Didige: Just like you edit the video you edit audio too
[10/07/18, 5:23:42 PM] Didige: Like you clean it up
[10/07/18, 5:23:46 PM] Didige: Some dubbing is there
[10/07/18, 5:23:49 PM] Didige: Let me check
[10/07/18, 5:23:53 PM] Didige: I am lost now
[10/07/18, 5:24:13 PM] Sush: It’s a slightly shoddy job of putting in English dialogue
[10/07/18, 5:24:31 PM] Sush: I kinda wish they’d just left it as subtitles like narcos
[10/07/18, 5:24:40 PM] Didige: What english dialogue?
[10/07/18, 5:25:01 PM] Didige: Ohhhhhh wait I think you're watching in English I am watching in Spanish with subtitles
[10/07/18, 5:25:02 PM] Sush: I mean, whether it is sync or dubbing it feels like a rush job
[10/07/18, 5:25:08 PM] Sush: Ohhhh
[10/07/18, 5:25:19 PM] Sush: ok that makes so much more sense
[10/07/18, 5:25:59 PM] Didige: Yaaaaaa 😂
[10/07/18, 5:26:05 PM] Didige: I am like what is she sayinggg
[10/07/18, 5:26:20 PM] Didige: Because you're in amrika you're getting English version

[16/12/18, 11:07:27 PM] Didige: And borrowed and ripped off are two different things
[16/12/18, 11:08:12 PM] Didige: And bitch changed it a day before the shoot and I was like wtf I didn't sign up for this . For this you wanted me to make so much commitment

[16/12/18, 11:10:33 PM] Didige: Rip off means the story was original yaa and so were the characters
[16/12/18, 11:11:03 PM] Sush: haan i'm familiar with the general aesthetic
[16/12/18, 11:11:03 PM] Didige: But I didn't come to film school to work on a Wes Anderson treatment .

[20/02/19, 5:13:57 PM] Didige: And bye
[20/02/19, 5:14:03 PM] Didige: Okay?
[20/02/19, 5:14:32 PM] Didige: I wore a v neck that day and I was drunk
[20/02/19, 5:14:47 PM] Didige: Maybe it was my fault
[20/02/19, 5:18:07 PM] Sush: what would you say to me if i was in your place? would you ever think it was my fault?
[20/02/19, 5:22:28 PM] Sush: ok i hope you're not responding because you're asleep ❤
[20/02/19, 5:29:38 PM] Didige: But you would probably never be in my place.
[20/02/19, 5:30:08 PM] Didige: I drink too much . I am apparently very crazy with how much I can drink
[20/02/19, 5:30:22 PM] Sush: untrue - i've used tinder more than you - statistically more likely to have been me
[20/02/19, 5:30:34 PM] Sush: according to whom?
[20/02/19, 5:31:06 PM] Didige: General public
[20/02/19, 5:31:27 PM] Didige: My own brother
[20/02/19, 5:32:06 PM] Didige: Ade kada. It was not Tinder's fault maybe
[20/02/19, 5:32:11 PM] Didige: So drunk
[20/02/19, 5:32:16 PM] Didige: How can
[20/02/19, 5:32:19 PM] Didige: Shame shame
[20/02/19, 5:32:21 PM] Didige: Chi
[20/02/19, 5:32:22 PM] Sush: it is literally ONE person's fault - the man who did it
[20/02/19, 5:32:26 PM] Didige: No sandkar
[20/02/19, 5:32:31 PM] Didige: Sanskar
[20/02/19, 5:32:43 PM] Didige: I went therw
[20/02/19, 5:33:24 PM] Sush: babe, we've all 'gone there' - it was sheer luck that it didn't turn out to be someone who was looking to get their way
[20/02/19, 5:33:46 PM] Didige: But I was drunk
[20/02/19, 5:33:53 PM] Didige: And didn't tell anyone
[20/02/19, 5:33:57 PM] Didige: So my fault
[20/02/19, 5:34:00 PM] Didige: Obvvvvv
[20/02/19, 5:34:05 PM] Didige: How stupid
[20/02/19, 5:34:09 PM] Sush: STILL his fault
[20/02/19, 5:34:10 PM] Didige: Chi
[20/02/19, 5:34:16 PM] Sush: no.matter.what.
[20/02/19, 5:34:25 PM] Didige: You know
[20/02/19, 5:35:00 PM] Didige: Maybe you think like this because you're my bae
[20/02/19, 5:35:12 PM] Didige: But chi
[20/02/19, 5:35:22 PM] Didige: Hain
[20/02/19, 5:35:29 PM] Sush: pls reserve your chi for the person who did it
[20/02/19, 5:35:39 PM] Didige: Some sense I should've had
[20/02/19, 5:35:50 PM] Didige: Wish I could remember
[20/02/19, 5:37:09 PM] Sush: i think we've all been in like 'vulnerable' situations like that - whether it ends badly or not is a function of luck
[20/02/19, 5:37:38 PM] Sush: and whether the people we happen to encounter are assholes are not
[20/02/19, 5:38:04 PM] Sush: i honestly believe it has nothing to do with you - the *consequences* are yours to bear, that's the unfairness of this all
[20/02/19, 5:38:25 PM] Sush: the actions though? his.fucking.fault.
[20/02/19, 5:40:40 PM] Sush: i know you know all this already
[20/02/19, 5:40:57 PM] Sush: but i think there's value in another person saying it out loud
[20/02/19, 5:41:08 PM] Sush: i'm not mansplaining
[20/02/19, 5:42:11 PM] Didige: Haan
[20/02/19, 5:42:27 PM] Didige: Par some sense I should've had
[20/02/19, 5:42:31 PM] Didige: To leave
[20/02/19, 5:42:43 PM] Didige: Something
[20/02/19, 5:42:47 PM] Didige: Dumb didigs
[20/02/19, 5:44:29 PM] Didige: Listen
[20/02/19, 5:45:45 PM] Didige: Don't be furious anymore . Plizz. I am sorry I fucked up and got myself into such a vulnerably spot . Bahut ho gaya. Gappa bas from didigs
[20/02/19, 5:45:58 PM] Didige: Go back to work
[20/02/19, 5:46:09 PM] Didige: I am going to try and sleep
[20/02/19, 5:46:18 PM] Sush: BRO i said i was furious that day that you didn't TALK to me about it
[20/02/19, 5:46:22 PM] Sush: not that it HAPPENED
[20/02/19, 5:46:32 PM] Sush: that also makes me furious - but with that man, not you!
[20/02/19, 5:46:56 PM] Sush: did you think i was talking about you????
[20/02/19, 5:47:05 PM] Didige: No no but Didigs also drunk now
[20/02/19, 5:47:18 PM] Didige: Didige has no shame
[20/02/19, 5:47:21 PM] Didige: Chi
[20/02/19, 5:47:30 PM] Sush: are you julius caesar ?
[20/02/19, 5:47:36 PM] Sush: khud ke baare me third mein bolta hai
[20/02/19, 5:47:41 PM] Sush: *third person
[20/02/19, 5:48:43 PM] Sush: Didige had something horrible be done to her and it really fucking sucks. Didige is now in the process of working through it and progressing.
[20/02/19, 5:48:53 PM] Didige: Sorry was In denial ☹️
[20/02/19, 5:49:44 PM] Didige: Hmmm but maybe it's her fault no? Maybe she hadddd something horrible done to her
[20/02/19, 5:49:46 PM] Sush: I know...remember we were telling Puff that she shouldn't have to go through stuff alone? that her sister wouldn't feel burdened if she told her her trouble instead she would be upset that she didn't let her in?
[20/02/19, 5:50:15 PM] Sush: i said that in that context
[20/02/19, 5:51:46 PM] Didige: Haan haan
[20/02/19, 5:51:53 PM] Sush: see the thing is - this could have happened in *so* many situations
[20/02/19, 5:51:56 PM] Didige: Phir bhi
[20/02/19, 5:52:20 PM] Sush: we know the stats - this happens to people in *all* kinds of contexts
[20/02/19, 5:52:34 PM] Sush: correct or no?
[20/02/19, 5:53:06 PM] Sush: it could have happened at a party
[20/02/19, 5:53:29 PM] Didige: Haann it didn't ever.
[20/02/19, 5:53:41 PM] Sush: that's literally just chance i feel
[20/02/19, 5:53:48 PM] Didige: So my fault
[20/02/19, 5:53:52 PM] Didige: No no
[20/02/19, 5:53:52 PM] Sush: Nope
[20/02/19, 5:53:55 PM] Sush: i study statistics
[20/02/19, 5:53:57 PM] Didige: Not chance
[20/02/19, 5:54:06 PM] Didige: I went back home sush
[20/02/19, 5:54:16 PM] Didige: And booked a cab
[20/02/19, 5:54:28 PM] Didige: To meet them again
[20/02/19, 5:54:51 PM] Didige: Then they gave ond bun on my face
[20/02/19, 5:55:08 PM] Didige: But shouldn't have been so dumb
[20/02/19, 5:55:27 PM] Didige: Imagine telling this to chukanna
[20/02/19, 5:55:35 PM] Didige: Forget my parents
[20/02/19, 5:55:55 PM] Didige: I will never be able to come out
[20/02/19, 5:55:57 PM] Didige: Chi
[20/02/19, 5:56:07 PM] Sush: talking about will definitely be hard
[20/02/19, 5:56:16 PM] Sush: it'll be hard for them to understand why tinder even
[20/02/19, 5:56:27 PM] Didige: Actually no
[20/02/19, 5:56:36 PM] Didige: Chukanna is on tindet
[20/02/19, 5:56:43 PM] Didige: 😄
[20/02/19, 5:56:57 PM] Didige: So chi anusha
[20/02/19, 5:57:05 PM] Didige: Fat anusha
[20/02/19, 5:57:23 PM] Sush: see the thing is no - whatever precautions you can take - the point is that someone else chose to do this
[20/02/19, 5:57:24 PM] Didige: Doesn't know how to put herself out there
[20/02/19, 5:57:39 PM] Didige: Hmmm
[20/02/19, 5:57:46 PM] Didige: I also chose
[20/02/19, 5:58:02 PM] Sush: don't become your own enemy - there are enough people to poke at us
[20/02/19, 5:58:34 PM] Didige: Babe go back to work . No point defending a fools ass
[20/02/19, 5:58:49 PM] Sush: ya re - but consent to talk isn't consent for penetration, consent to kissing isn't consent for penetration, consent given can be withdrawn at ANY point
[20/02/19, 6:14:12 PM] Sush: sending you so many ❤s from here

[21/02/19, 1:29:29 PM] Didige: There was a man at the party I was at who wouldn't leave me . Nothing happened but it got weird and I had a slight argument with rohit about the insta story I put up
[21/02/19, 1:29:36 PM] Didige: So it all manifested like this

[04/03/19, 3:51:23 PM] Sush: i think it's just a difference in approach in that sense
[04/03/19, 3:51:26 PM] Didige: Just signing up for disappointment always
[04/03/19, 3:51:48 PM] Didige: Yaa but like you and I also approach things differently
[04/03/19, 3:51:47 PM] Sush: has she been generally distant again?
[04/03/19, 3:52:17 PM] Didige: Ya ya . Remember that time she was doing kirik . One week she was fine then she started again
[04/03/19, 3:52:19 PM] Didige: So idk
[04/03/19, 3:52:48 PM] Sush: ya maybe slightly adjust expectations? :/
[04/03/19, 3:53:03 PM] Sush: sounds like this is kind of where she's at right now
[04/03/19, 3:53:30 PM] Sush: but also try not to push her away as punishment
[04/03/19, 3:53:36 PM] Didige: Yeah I think so . It's fine . It would've been nice if she was around but maybe she'll come in another form
[04/03/19, 3:53:41 PM] Didige: Like Ashwath
[04/03/19, 3:53:51 PM] Didige: Hau hau

[16/04/19, 2:27:25 PM] Didige: Side note : my therapist said she's major flakey it's fine for now keep her aside . You have reached out to her so there's no point in telling her again.
[16/04/19, 2:28:38 PM] Didige: And this is the second time she's doing this at pivotal points so yeah . Don't cut her off or anything just if she calls or texts do respond and if you feel like meeting meet.  But don't weigh your heart out immediately
[16/04/19, 2:28:44 PM] Didige: Let her build back trust
[16/04/19, 2:28:53 PM] Sush: sounds very sensible

[16/04/19, 2:30:10 PM] Didige: Collective energy update (April 2019)

There's an important energy in the astrology that's been going on over the past month or so and it seems to be affecting many so I took some time to write about it and some tips on how to approach it. Hope it helps 🙏🙂😇 (Pluto, South node conjunction with Saturn in Capricorn). 

You might notice an area (or a few areas) of life where something feels very disempowering. There's an energy of transformation but it doesn't feel easy or pleasant. It's like some truth being revealed straight in the face in its complete messiness/ugliness/powerlessness, which can feel rather unsettling. Like using a plunger in the toilet and having all the dirtiness unclogged, which is good in the long run but doesn't feel very wholesome in the moment (Pluto).

It is highly charged because it's one of those patterns that's been karmically linked to you for a long time through ancestors, previous lifetimes, etc. It might even be so intrinsic to you that until now it just felt like who you are and you never saw this pattern or feelings as clearly as you are now able to (Capricorn). It might be revealed by an event like a break up, death, job loss, finding yourself in a powerless position, boundary violation, etc. or a sudden build-up of inner urgency to be honest with yourself and change something (Pluto).

In the same area, there's also an attitude of surrender and egolessness required which might even be forced by a feeling of helplessness (South node). And there's a simultaneous need to be "responsible" about the way you navigate this messiness or powerlessness. You can't use your "usual coping tactics". The calling is for some higher action and since you're bursting out of your oppressive karmic conditioning, your higher self will feel more available to you than ever before. 

You have to navigate this with some discipline, responsibility, hard work, perseverance. Can't just react immaturely or avoid the lesson (Saturn, Pluto, south node will not let you). Its important to look at what's taking away your power or peace of mind and really inquire about what you can do to help yourself in a mature way. And it's not going to be a quick fix. With Saturn, it's a dedicated sustained effort to commit and work towards whatever that thing is that will eventually leave you feeling truly empowered (Pluto). 

For instance, it may be learning to communicate effectively or learning to respect yourself or learning to set boundaries or committing to discovering yourself or committing to a move or new phase of life or letting go of a toxic person in your life. None of these things happen overnight. They take sustained efforts and commitment. Even though it may feel like a huge task as you start it, you will have some ease, support and even divine grace (Jupiter) as you undertake them. Make sure the action taken is for the highest good of you and others, not out of impulsive/selfish gains at this time (South node will demand spiritual development which is a more selfless than materialistic energy).

Monna with Sakshi before I could even figure out the plan with rohit . Not that I said I will come that day but still like whut? 

At le vantage ? I came with you . To hangout with you! I still get anxiety at bars because of what happened. I have found ways to channel it but it's a slow process . I reached out to you twice literally telling you I am not okay.
[16/04/19, 11:01:39 PM] Didige: Or maybe just the first paragraph is enough
[16/04/19, 11:01:59 PM] Didige: I don't have the energy for her again

[14/05/19, 3:34:42 PM] Sush: i don't know
[14/05/19, 3:34:52 PM] Sush: she was _very_ insulting towards me
[14/05/19, 3:35:18 PM] Sush: and has basically said in many ways over the last couple of years to leave her alone
[14/05/19, 3:35:26 PM] Didige: True and not cool . But do off phone call
[14/05/19, 3:35:41 PM] Didige: Or maybe some miscommunication no?
[14/05/19, 3:36:08 PM] Sush: i actually think i've been an idiot not to hear it
[14/05/19, 3:36:14 PM] Sush: i kept trying to push it
[14/05/19, 3:36:26 PM] Sush: but she's clearly not been interested
[14/05/19, 3:36:58 PM] Didige: She seemed to have become little bit angry and since you haven't seen her that much maybe both of you missed that change that has happened in the last 2 years at least
[14/05/19, 3:37:28 PM] Didige: I remember we talked the change part before
[14/05/19, 3:37:41 PM] Didige: You're getting what I am saying?
[14/05/19, 3:38:11 PM] Didige: Maybe she was pushing her closest friends out and being in her angry shell
[14/05/19, 3:38:35 PM] Sush: here's the thing though
[14/05/19, 3:38:48 PM] Sush: i am *not* a close friend anymore
[14/05/19, 3:39:12 PM] Sush: and at some point 'no talk to me and figure this out' just becomes me invading her space
‎[14/05/19, 3:39:57 PM] Sush: ‎image omitted
[14/05/19, 3:40:46 PM] Sush: matlab...shouldn't i just let it go and not chase a person who feels this way about me?
[14/05/19, 3:41:07 PM] Sush: and to be really honest, i'm having all these anxieties because i'm like - what does this episode say about me?
[14/05/19, 3:41:21 PM] Sush: more than...omg i really fucking miss her
[14/05/19, 3:42:45 PM] Didige: Are you 100 percent sure this was about you only. I know she put this up right after you guys argued but who knows maybe it was another 2 people also . Also this again shows angst she has  towards the world. And that's not cool and she needs to chill correct
[14/05/19, 3:43:02 PM] Sush: definitely me re
[14/05/19, 3:43:14 PM] Sush: and this is also what's so cruel about this kind of slytweeting
[14/05/19, 3:43:24 PM] Sush: you never have to take responsibility for what you said
[14/05/19, 3:43:39 PM] Sush: you've communicated this to me and have taken _no_ ownership of what you said
[14/05/19, 3:44:01 PM] Didige: Had we not talked and figured out our problems we wouldn't have been here. I know the form was very different for us but I am just saying .
[14/05/19, 3:44:31 PM] Didige: Yes and that makes sense
[14/05/19, 3:44:30 PM] Sush: we were fighting for 6 months re not 3 years
[14/05/19, 3:46:36 PM] Didige: Maybe not raa . This is what I saying maybeeee not just you . Or maybe she's just a papad but  worth finding out naa
[14/05/19, 3:47:02 PM] Sush: she said 'goodbye, sush'
[14/05/19, 3:47:07 PM] Sush: what is there for me to say after that????
[14/05/19, 3:47:18 PM] Didige: Correct . Adhe forms were different
[14/05/19, 3:48:12 PM] Didige: But fight is fight and we talked about it and tried to fix it . I remember first pushing you out when I  reached SG before we actually got to talking
[14/05/19, 3:48:35 PM] Didige: That's just horrible and mean.
[14/05/19, 3:49:09 PM] Sush: a big part of you pushing people away is to see if they try to stop you re
[14/05/19, 3:49:13 PM] Didige: I am just saying give her a call . Maybe she'll still be mean but you know you tried and fought for your friend
[14/05/19, 3:49:34 PM] Sush: it's pretty different for her
[14/05/19, 3:50:02 PM] Sush: like you do it a lot when you think people aren't fighting for you and you want to see if they will
[14/05/19, 3:50:05 PM] Didige: Yeah correct but it's also because I was going through a lot . And I was angry and all things PTSD
[14/05/19, 3:51:00 PM] Didige: Correct and it's my general defense and protection mechanism
[14/05/19, 3:51:12 PM] Didige: And I am sure she has other ways of doing it
[14/05/19, 3:51:51 PM] Didige: I am just trying to understand her maybe possibilities
[14/05/19, 3:53:28 PM] Sush: i don't know if this idea of friendship is preventing from respecting her boundaries when she's clearly saying fuckoff
[14/05/19, 3:53:49 PM] Sush: *preventing me
[14/05/19, 3:54:22 PM] Sush: also this
[14/05/19, 3:55:11 PM] Didige: If a person wanted to create boundaries they wouldn't say fuck off they'd create it subtly
[14/05/19, 3:55:40 PM] Didige: Are you feeling like this because of cheth?
[14/05/19, 3:56:18 PM] Didige: I sometimes still take some time to digest it so I can only imagine how it is for you
[14/05/19, 3:56:55 PM] Sush: definitely part of it
[14/05/19, 3:57:15 PM] Sush: so she *has* been subtly saying it for at least two years
[14/05/19, 3:57:52 PM] Sush: i just feel like they've really moved on from me and i am struggling to
[14/05/19, 3:58:39 PM] Didige: She wouldn't call you for her wedding baap if wanted  boundary . She would've used the cheth card. Noticing how she's behaved she's definitely mean enough to use that card
[14/05/19, 3:59:03 PM] Sush: means she's been trying to create more distance
[14/05/19, 3:59:09 PM] Sush: of course she'd call me for her wedding na
[14/05/19, 3:59:17 PM] Didige: Because you want her in your life and just for this literally I am saying it's worth a call
[14/05/19, 3:59:45 PM] Sush: she has not been a positive presence in my life for at least 2 years
[14/05/19, 4:00:07 PM] Didige: Boundaries create karna chahti tho nahi karthi thi. So she's called you means obviously she wants you in her life naaa
[14/05/19, 4:00:12 PM] Sush: i'm worried about what it means about me that i'm falling out with old friends than i'm worried about her not being in my life
[14/05/19, 4:00:36 PM] Sush: arre you invite so many people to your wedding you're not bffs with
[14/05/19, 4:01:07 PM] Sush: honestly do i have the emotional energy to chase after another old friend? really, no
[14/05/19, 4:01:08 PM] Didige: Ya but you were bffs and now you want to create boundaries means from another country you want call
[14/05/19, 4:01:29 PM] Didige: This is one adulting problem I feel
[14/05/19, 4:05:54 PM] Didige: With gaddam I know the fall out was not just because she was supportive through my PTSD . Younger me would've talked to another friend but as this aaulting happened I was disappointed that the one person I thought I could rely on In hyd gave haath.  


What I am trying to say is I totes get the worry and if you're okay to let go I get it . I am just saying it could be worth it to have a conversation before you do that .
[14/05/19, 4:06:09 PM] Didige: Was not supportive*
[14/05/19, 4:06:55 PM] Didige: I think you do because you wouldn't have been thinking about this otherwise
[14/05/19, 4:08:13 PM] Didige: This fear is coming from a wtf did cheth do area . Not that you don't have the emotional bandwidth
[14/05/19, 4:09:05 PM] Didige: Won't*
[14/05/19, 4:21:59 PM] Didige: Babe?
[14/05/19, 4:23:56 PM] Sush: Ugh sorry
[14/05/19, 4:24:01 PM] Sush: Burned my finger
[14/05/19, 4:24:06 PM] Sush: Finding bandaid
[14/05/19, 4:24:21 PM] Didige: Uh ohhhh

[14/05/19, 4:37:24 PM] Sush: hi

[14/05/19, 4:40:49 PM] Sush: someone left the small heater on
[14/05/19, 4:41:27 PM] Sush: reached over for something and hit it fully
[14/05/19, 4:48:03 PM] Sush: So gaye?

[14/05/19, 10:12:24 PM] Didige: How are you feeling about it now
[15/05/19, 1:43:40 AM] Didige: Puffs birthday
[15/05/19, 9:56:07 AM] Sush: yessss
[15/05/19, 9:56:15 AM] Sush: still conflicted!
[15/05/19, 9:56:22 AM] Sush: might send an email
[15/05/19, 10:15:57 AM] Sush: see this?
[15/05/19, 10:15:59 AM] Sush: Hey Ovi. Belated birthday wishes! I wanted to reach out because our last conversation felt heated and ugly and I didn't want to leave things that way. 

I'm sorry if I made you feel like I was forcing an angle on relationships/marriage in general or your relationship/marriage - that was certainly not my intention, I was talking about myself and none of that was about you. When I said 'could happen to anyone' I meant feeling attracted to someone else, not acting on it - this is a choice few people make. I should have been more explicit in saying that. Perhaps you should also not have said something as judgmental as ‘you need to make better choices' or calling me 'twisted af', or even adjudicating my words by the standards of a 'neutral intellectual discussion' when that's clearly not what it was.

I have obviously been excited for you and your wedding and have expressed that several times in several ways, so I hope you get where I was coming from. Hope you're enjoying the lead-up to your wedding - I'm sure you'll be a beautiful bride!
[15/05/19, 10:23:05 AM] Didige: No . It sounds like you're apologising .
[15/05/19, 10:23:25 AM] Didige: Only
[15/05/19, 10:24:27 AM] Sush: u a judgemental bitch i want to say
[15/05/19, 10:24:31 AM] Sush: but what's the point idk
[15/05/19, 10:24:40 AM] Sush: it's not like i'm looking to fix things
[15/05/19, 10:24:46 AM] Sush: i just want to keep things cordial tbh
[15/05/19, 10:25:00 AM] Sush: i don't really want her in my life fuck that energy i have no time or space for it
[15/05/19, 10:28:51 AM] Sush: fucking bitches have turned me into a person that second guesses hereself CONSTANTLY
[15/05/19, 10:29:11 AM] Sush: i have no confidence in anything i say or do in my personal life anymore
[15/05/19, 10:29:41 AM] Sush: operate under the assumption that i'm a fucked up, twisted, toxic, worthless bitch
[15/05/19, 10:29:58 AM] Sush: that people need to cut out of their life for the sake of their own sanity and happiness
[15/05/19, 10:30:44 AM] Sush: i'll probably spare everyone a lot of nuisance and shit if i just died
[15/05/19, 10:38:34 AM] Didige: 😡😠🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
[15/05/19, 10:51:27 AM] Didige: That's exactly why I am saying you sound like you're apologising and there's no need to apologise
[15/05/19, 10:51:35 AM] Didige: Driving babewill reply slowly
[15/05/19, 1:23:02 PM] Sush: No worries

[27/05/19, 12:28:17 AM] Sush: It helped a lot
[27/05/19, 12:28:32 AM] Didige: Ya like there IS miscommunication on text or decreased communication and simple in the morning you're getting ready you don't want to text for 10 minutes
[27/05/19, 12:28:42 AM] Didige: 30 sec phone call!
[27/05/19, 12:28:46 AM] Sush: Otherwise our core team meeting would just get hijacked by urgent needs and the science gets left behind
[27/05/19, 12:28:53 AM] Sush: True
[27/05/19, 12:29:06 AM] Sush: Some people are damn anal about phone calls tho
[27/05/19, 12:29:18 AM] Didige: As in
[27/05/19, 12:29:37 AM] Sush: Like some people just refuse to call
[27/05/19, 12:29:41 AM] Sush: Will only text
[27/05/19, 12:29:47 AM] Sush: Is she like that always
[27/05/19, 12:30:25 AM] Didige: Noo
[27/05/19, 12:30:36 AM] Sush: That’s v annoying
[27/05/19, 12:31:33 AM] Didige: There was miscommunication for 2 weeks because of shit like this with client
[27/05/19, 12:31:44 AM] Didige: Uggh
[27/05/19, 12:32:01 AM] Sush: You should bring this up with her
[27/05/19, 12:32:12 AM] Didige: I tried
[27/05/19, 12:32:19 AM] Sush: Like say hey Latha it helps me understand what you want better if I can call you
[27/05/19, 12:32:22 AM] Didige: She shunned the conversation before it started
[27/05/19, 12:32:30 AM] Sush: Ugh
[27/05/19, 12:32:45 AM] Sush: Try this angle once
[27/05/19, 12:32:56 AM] Didige: While she made me come with her for colour printouts of her new diet chart
[27/05/19, 12:33:01 AM] Didige: 😡
[27/05/19, 12:33:02 AM] Sush: Wtf
[27/05/19, 12:33:13 AM] Didige: Which I'd already shunned the previous day
[27/05/19, 12:33:18 AM] Sush: That’s daaamn annoying
[27/05/19, 12:33:44 AM] Didige: Bro you know how some people can't do errands on their own at all and want someone to come with them
[27/05/19, 12:33:54 AM] Didige: I used to come earlier sometimes
[27/05/19, 12:34:01 AM] Didige: When we were friends
[27/05/19, 12:34:11 AM] Didige: I created a distance after kochi
[27/05/19, 12:34:31 AM] Didige: In the morning I texted her saying I need to talk so she did this
[27/05/19, 12:34:39 AM] Didige: And didn't even talk properly
[27/05/19, 12:35:16 AM] Sush: Ugh
[27/05/19, 12:35:48 AM] Didige: The little talk we had made things better le
[27/05/19, 12:35:54 AM] Sush: Yeah?
[27/05/19, 12:36:06 AM] Sush: Then take it one improvement at a time
[27/05/19, 12:36:11 AM] Didige: Ya
[27/05/19, 12:36:38 AM] Didige: And nain therapist arpi pranati also said this
[27/05/19, 12:37:02 AM] Didige: If she can't deal with conversation it's not your problem. In a team you have to communicate
[27/05/19, 12:37:23 AM] Sush: For sure
[27/05/19, 12:37:34 AM] Didige: I used to say confrontation . Then nain said oh heavy word. Communication didige
[27/05/19, 12:37:40 AM] Didige: I liked that angle
[27/05/19, 12:37:43 AM] Sush: There will be things that are not ideal keep talking keeping adjusting
[27/05/19, 12:37:46 AM] Sush: Good point
[27/05/19, 12:37:56 AM] Didige: Exactly
[27/05/19, 12:38:06 AM] Sush: Also maybe don’t do a we need to talk thing next tome?
[27/05/19, 12:38:16 AM] Sush: That also is little heavy
[27/05/19, 12:38:31 AM] Sush: Like just bring it up like hey text confuses me
[27/05/19, 12:38:39 AM] Sush: For the next conv
[27/05/19, 12:38:47 AM] Didige: No I had to bring up something more important
[27/05/19, 12:38:49 AM] Sush: This one makes sense
[27/05/19, 12:39:04 AM] Didige: This is one of the smaller things that annoys me about her
[27/05/19, 12:39:08 AM] Didige: 🤦🏽‍♀
[27/05/19, 12:39:38 AM] Didige: And like I'd been trying to get a minute with her for 2 3days
[27/05/19, 12:40:03 AM] Didige: But it was not happening . So I just said hey I'd like to talk to you today
[27/05/19, 12:40:07 AM] Didige: Just 5 10 minutes
[27/05/19, 12:40:15 AM] Didige: Tried keep it as casual as possible
[27/05/19, 12:40:33 AM] Sush: Maybe be like talk about X next time
[27/05/19, 12:40:57 AM] Didige: Dude this only she slid under carpet
[27/05/19, 12:41:10 AM] Sush: Since she’s your boss I want to talk to you might come off a bit like you want to scold her
[27/05/19, 12:41:24 AM] Sush: Saying a specific thing makes it harder for her evade
[27/05/19, 12:41:32 AM] Didige: I started the conversation with are you unhappy with my performance!
[27/05/19, 12:41:57 AM] Didige: Knowing very well that my performance has been good
[27/05/19, 12:42:02 AM] Sush: That’s also kinda broad
[27/05/19, 12:42:11 AM] Sush: Don’t do that just address what you want to
[27/05/19, 12:42:17 AM] Sush: Like don’t play games
[27/05/19, 12:42:34 AM] Didige: How to say hello sis you need to communicate better
[27/05/19, 12:42:55 AM] Didige: Because it's causing miscommunication with client
[27/05/19, 12:43:02 AM] Sush: You can’t. You say hello sis when X happens can you do Y? It would help me do Z
[27/05/19, 12:43:13 AM] Sush: Frame it as alternatives
[27/05/19, 12:43:22 AM] Sush: Not don’t do this but can we do that?
[27/05/19, 12:44:03 AM] Didige: Can't . She's very bound to what she likes and needs me to wrap my head around it
[27/05/19, 12:44:15 AM] Didige: I didn't say thay
[27/05/19, 12:44:15 AM] Sush: This also no need in future - no need to plant ideas in her head
[27/05/19, 12:44:44 AM] Sush: You know you’re doing a good job don’t give room for any other opinion
[27/05/19, 12:45:08 AM] Didige: No I was not giving 100 percent because I had to create a friendship and professional relationship boundary
[27/05/19, 12:45:17 AM] Didige: Which she doesn't believe in
[27/05/19, 12:45:52 AM] Didige: I was doing 90
[27/05/19, 12:46:09 AM] Sush: It’s her job to bring that up if required
[27/05/19, 12:46:18 AM] Sush: Leave it to her
[27/05/19, 12:46:25 AM] Didige: No I can also bring it up
[27/05/19, 12:46:59 AM] Sush: Like if you ask are u unhappy she’ll be like oh do I have reason to be?
[27/05/19, 12:47:12 AM] Sush: Don’t give room for that is my point
[27/05/19, 12:47:20 AM] Didige: Ya and I was certain there was no Reason
[27/05/19, 12:47:28 AM] Didige: So I confidently asked
[27/05/19, 12:48:08 AM] Sush: what did you intend for that conversation to be?
[27/05/19, 12:52:48 AM] Didige: To be like hey I've dulled 10% I've not been taking initiative because I felt there was a communication gap
[27/05/19, 12:53:14 AM] Didige: And I am so extra in that angle I am always taking initiative
[27/05/19, 12:53:23 AM] Didige: Okay I just called her and spoke to her
[27/05/19, 12:53:25 AM] Didige: Wow
[27/05/19, 12:53:29 AM] Didige: It went well
[27/05/19, 12:53:41 AM] Sush: Maybe frame that as hey I’m feeling this communication gap if we fix it I’ll be 10% better
[27/05/19, 12:53:46 AM] Sush: Good!!
[27/05/19, 12:54:04 AM] Didige: How can I say communication gap
[27/05/19, 12:54:11 AM] Didige: It's like scolding
[27/05/19, 12:54:16 AM] Didige: Actually it's not
[27/05/19, 12:54:18 AM] Didige: Hmm
[27/05/19, 12:54:25 AM] Sush: Yeah not if you’re being really specific about it
[27/05/19, 12:54:52 AM] Didige: Ya when I asked she was like whut ! You're a great associate wtf are you talking about
[27/05/19, 12:54:54 AM] Sush: Go back to this will help me understand you better
[27/05/19, 12:55:06 AM] Didige: Ya I like this a lot!
[27/05/19, 12:55:33 AM] Sush: Yeah and like idk don’t try to guilt her into fixing something. Just ask for it
[27/05/19, 12:56:00 AM] Sush: You’re entitled to it
[27/05/19, 12:56:12 AM] Didige: I also got this doubt because Keerthi was making website and she said production design team for me . I am fucking associate what team!
[27/05/19, 12:56:50 AM] Didige: So that's where this started . She didn't give me room to bring that up
[27/05/19, 12:56:56 AM] Sush: Ohh
[27/05/19, 12:57:04 AM] Didige: And it says production designer on the website now
[27/05/19, 12:57:30 AM] Didige: Keerthi asked her for 2 3 lines about me . And Keerthi loves me so it could be something good
[27/05/19, 12:57:45 AM] Didige: True
[27/05/19, 12:58:56 AM] Sush: What did she say to Keerthi
[27/05/19, 12:59:12 AM] Didige: Don't know
[27/05/19, 12:59:18 AM] Didige: She typed and sent it

[10/07/19, 12:53:33 PM] Didige: secondly I don't think she is talking about you
[10/07/19, 12:53:39 PM] Didige: thirdly even if she issss
[10/07/19, 12:53:39 PM] Sush: she isssss
[10/07/19, 12:53:57 PM] Didige: she needs to be adult enough to pick up the phone and call you
[10/07/19, 12:54:13 PM] Didige: and not be cryptic and write blog notes about dead fucking rats
[10/07/19, 12:54:16 PM] Sush: i mean shes clearly saying i am not a fondly missed absence lmao
[10/07/19, 12:54:23 PM] Sush: oh no the dead rat is not about me
[10/07/19, 12:54:37 PM] Didige: ya I know
[10/07/19, 12:54:44 PM] Sush: just the line about 'absent-others who would feel entitled to their discomfort'
[10/07/19, 12:54:47 PM] Sush: haan
[10/07/19, 12:55:34 PM] Didige: why you think this is about you 2) she also felt discomfort
[10/07/19, 12:55:41 PM] Didige: so that doesn't make her entitled
[10/07/19, 12:55:56 PM] Didige: whatta guggu da this one
[10/07/19, 12:55:58 PM] Sush: because she has this whole narrative about me being an entitled brahmin brat
[10/07/19, 12:56:31 PM] Didige: okay she must be saying that to all brahmins no in general
[10/07/19, 12:56:53 PM] Didige: that's what she consistently angry-ily writes about no?
[10/07/19, 12:57:00 PM] Sush: but she's saying no person who used to be in her life
[10/07/19, 12:57:18 PM] Sush: maybe me + someone else
[10/07/19, 12:57:31 PM] Didige: ya maybe
[10/07/19, 12:57:47 PM] Didige: also please can we not take cryptic dead rat blog posts seriously
[10/07/19, 12:57:55 PM] Didige: like I can't believe what I just read
[10/07/19, 12:57:55 PM] Sush: someone needs to tell her to not be a bitch
[10/07/19, 12:58:12 PM] Sush: and to just b e kinder
[10/07/19, 12:58:21 PM] Sush: i think i've come to terms with it a lot more
[10/07/19, 12:58:26 PM] Sush: she has her needs, i have mine
[10/07/19, 12:58:30 PM] Sush: they are not aligned
[10/07/19, 12:58:43 PM] Didige: and she doesn't want to align it either
[10/07/19, 12:58:48 PM] Didige: you've made all efforts
[10/07/19, 12:59:14 PM] Didige: if in future there's enough space and incidents let's hope you reconnect
[10/07/19, 12:59:25 PM] Sush: not interested bro
[10/07/19, 12:59:49 PM] Didige: ya that's what I am saying like whatever for now
[10/07/19, 12:59:53 PM] Sush: i no longer want to 'hold space' for that type of energy in my life
[10/07/19, 1:00:14 PM] Didige: :)
[10/07/19, 1:00:27 PM] Didige: thusss let's not decode dead rat blog posts
[10/07/19, 1:00:45 PM] Didige: and no holding space yes, but no closing doors or holding grudges
[10/07/19, 1:00:59 PM] Didige: the best form of moving on is to just be nonchalant
[10/07/19, 1:01:02 PM] Sush: closing some doors is healthyyyy
[10/07/19, 1:01:12 PM] Sush: and it is self-preservation
[10/07/19, 1:01:41 PM] Sush: bloody.
[10/07/19, 1:01:47 PM] Sush: morning morning heartbreak.
[10/07/19, 1:01:52 PM] Sush: then kirkiri
[10/07/19, 1:02:01 PM] Sush: woke up . at 4:30 to see us lose the game
[10/07/19, 1:02:38 PM] Didige: I am saying don't close the door only so you don't not go to a wedding or a city to see someone in the city because she is going to be there
[10/07/19, 1:03:00 PM] Sush: hmm good point - i shouldnt do blanket closing
[10/07/19, 1:03:12 PM] Sush: close only ovidoor
[10/07/19, 1:03:19 PM] Didige: it kinda happened with cheth and I totally understand the dynamic that was in . don't let it happen with her again
[10/07/19, 1:03:27 PM] Didige: just not worth it
[10/07/19, 1:03:29 PM] Didige: yaaaaa

[10/07/19, 1:04:19 PM] Sush: i felt heartbroken by a game also after so long
[10/07/19, 1:04:27 PM] Sush: in a way it feels almost good?
[10/07/19, 1:04:33 PM] Didige: 💔
[10/07/19, 1:04:39 PM] Sush: like getting lost in a great, but sad book
[10/07/19, 1:04:51 PM] Didige: seee
[10/07/19, 1:04:57 PM] Sush: this world cup has been good for my mental health i think
[10/07/19, 1:05:06 PM] Didige: I want to say I have opinions about this but I dont
[10/07/19, 1:05:09 PM] Didige: okay now I do
[10/07/19, 1:05:10 PM] Didige: go on
[10/07/19, 1:05:12 PM] Sush: it's given by brain a healthy thing to chew on

[10/07/19, 1:06:02 PM] Sush: this cup caught my attention after a long time
[10/07/19, 1:06:12 PM] Sush: maybe not being in school + having a tv

[10/07/19, 1:07:08 PM] Sush: obvs it won't come naturally at first
[10/07/19, 1:07:15 PM] Sush: you need familiarity because you get invested
[10/07/19, 1:07:33 PM] Sush: familiarity with men's cricket doesnt need effort given the way we grew up
[10/07/19, 1:07:41 PM] Sush: we just got exposed by default
[10/07/19, 1:07:45 PM] Didige: you scowled at me for having a  tv in blore and thought I was dumb .

[10/07/19, 1:28:02 PM] Didige: yaaa ishh

[10/07/19, 1:29:33 PM] Didige: with VG
[10/07/19, 1:30:02 PM] Didige: latha is not gonna do the venkatesh film which tharun is directing
[10/07/19, 1:30:35 PM] Sush: oh! is that . better for you?
[10/07/19, 1:30:36 PM] Didige: so now I am like what's my role. And everyone looks at me from latha's eyes so I am trying to recreate that
[10/07/19, 1:30:59 PM] Didige: I don't know they're gonna get another production designer . Now if they come with their own team
[10/07/19, 1:31:17 PM] Didige: like are you positively giving me growth from the last film I did with you guys

[10/07/19, 1:33:39 PM] Didige: latha is not in town and there really no point in having direct conversations with her about growth and roles and pay
[10/07/19, 1:33:38 PM] Sush: it makes sense for you to advocate for yourself and not rely on latha to do it
[10/07/19, 1:34:00 PM] Sush: she hasn't given you any reason to trust her on it
[10/07/19, 1:34:50 PM] Didige: yaaa

[10/07/19, 1:39:07 PM] Didige: Like I am gonna be like see I want to be with VG you guys obviously know that and I want to continuously work with all the exciting projects but what's the role I'll be involved in , in what form and what are the possible timelines
[10/07/19, 1:39:47 PM] Didige: I am starting to look at some  land investments as financial security so I'd like to know so I can plan accordingly
[10/07/19, 1:40:53 PM] Sush: No need to get into that i feel
[10/07/19, 1:40:55 PM] Didige: which is true btw nothing concrete yet so haven't mentioned 2 u . also the furniture store but I don't want to mention this to them yet because it's not concrete at all and I don't want latha to know
[10/07/19, 1:41:02 PM] Didige: whyyy
[10/07/19, 1:41:11 PM] Didige: bro they don't pay well
[10/07/19, 1:41:26 PM] Sush: it has nothing to do with them and you've already said latha has this attitude about you not 'needing' money
[10/07/19, 1:41:43 PM] Sush: this will further the impression of that no?
[10/07/19, 1:42:02 PM] Sush: this,  yes. just say 'to plan future commitments'.
[10/07/19, 1:42:18 PM] Sush: you don't owe details - whatever you say . can and will be used against you
[10/07/19, 1:42:37 PM] Didige: no won't it give the impression of I am trying to fund my own damn life .
[10/07/19, 1:42:59 PM] Sush: no, it shows them alternative income sources
[10/07/19, 1:43:13 PM] Sush: which reduces your 'need' for them - in their eyes
[10/07/19, 1:43:38 PM] Didige: that's too vague yaa . And I am not full time committing it's a project
[10/07/19, 1:43:42 PM] Sush: how you fund your life is none of their business - keep the conversation to you being compensated fairly for the work you do for them
[10/07/19, 1:44:12 PM] Didige: because they don't pay well
[10/07/19, 1:44:35 PM] Didige: the problem is nobody in the industry pays well
[10/07/19, 1:44:47 PM] Didige: so everyone has alternate income sources.
[10/07/19, 1:44:58 PM] Sush: what is the reason for you to bring it up?
[10/07/19, 1:45:11 PM] Sush: (asking, not being like why would you bring it up)
[10/07/19, 1:45:28 PM] Didige: like latha's was interior so I was pissed because the reason I even did it was for the money
[10/07/19, 1:47:05 PM] Didige: because time commitments need to plan no? unfortunately again, they hold power so if I say things like future commitments it could also mean other films and they could spread a bad name about me .
[10/07/19, 1:47:38 PM] Didige: I mean they would assume that only . And I am trying to say if you give me a timeline , if you pay me well I won't even look for this alternate income
[10/07/19, 1:48:31 PM] Sush: yeah - i wonder if you just say 'so i can plan my time' - they're not going to be like 'why?'
[10/07/19, 1:48:49 PM] Didige: oh they will
[10/07/19, 1:49:07 PM] Sush: aaah that's annoying
[10/07/19, 1:50:01 PM] Didige: ya some people are making me sound like a traitor because I did baahubali
[10/07/19, 1:50:04 PM] Didige: -_-
[10/07/19, 1:50:16 PM] Didige: but also I don't know what latha told them
[10/07/19, 1:50:29 PM] Didige: tharun didn't know for a month that I was doing that
[10/07/19, 1:50:43 PM] Didige: which realllyyyy makes me question wtf he is doing as a founder
[10/07/19, 1:50:59 PM] Didige: I mean he isn't the ceo but like bro know where people are at
[10/07/19, 1:53:24 PM] Sush: that's nuts
[10/07/19, 1:53:33 PM] Sush: latha is def not a clean conduit
[10/07/19, 1:53:55 PM] Sush: your instinct is right in changing the dynamic away from them looking at u through latha
[10/07/19, 1:54:44 PM] Didige: what yaa what I am doing
[10/07/19, 1:54:52 PM] Didige: okay this is going to sound nuts
[10/07/19, 1:54:56 PM] Didige: and it could be
[10/07/19, 1:55:03 PM] Didige: but this I am thinking out loud
[10/07/19, 1:56:02 PM] Didige: so I found VG when I was in like denial part of ptsd and I used to do the film and go to the restaurant , basically over worked myself
[10/07/19, 1:56:21 PM] Didige: so I am unsure if my entire judgement of them was wrong and now I am seeing it
[10/07/19, 1:56:47 PM] Didige: but it could also be hiccups before a film start . which I haven't seen this closely so I really don't know
[10/07/19, 1:57:03 PM] Didige: and everyone is frustrated
[10/07/19, 1:59:33 PM] Sush: probably a combination of both - i'd say wait until you have a project going because you reasses that
[10/07/19, 1:59:36 PM] Sush: *reassess
[10/07/19, 2:01:13 PM] Sush: sorry replying slowly - andy came to the office
[10/07/19, 2:04:25 PM] Didige: ya trueee
[11/07/19, 1:38:33 AM] Didige: Behen
[11/07/19, 1:38:47 AM] Didige: In all of yesterday rant I forgot to give positive update
[11/07/19, 1:39:14 AM] Didige: I downloaded bumble and have been chatting . Haven't gone or anything just downloaded
[11/07/19, 1:39:35 AM] Didige: I will tell you if anything becomes concrete

[11/07/19, 10:17:48 AM] Didige: Ofcccc
[11/07/19, 10:18:00 AM] Didige: Shadi nahi karni
[11/07/19, 10:18:11 AM] Sush: 👯‍♂👯‍♂
[11/07/19, 10:33:58 AM] Didige: Bro
[11/07/19, 10:34:02 AM] Didige: My brother
[11/07/19, 10:34:05 AM] Didige: I can't
[11/07/19, 10:34:08 AM] Didige: -_-
[11/07/19, 10:36:00 AM] Didige: He just yelled at me and said wtf after something like that happened how can you get on it again ? You are being stupid .
[11/07/19, 10:36:43 AM] Didige: I said ya but I am being safe and meeting him in a public place . And you don't the circumstances in which it happened . And I will be safe
[11/07/19, 10:38:51 AM] Didige: Then he said as I brother I can never give you my blessing leave from here . I said you are on bumble and you go on so many dates . Ya I am a guy , I am sorry but it's the truth . I said ya you meet women no? Ya but I know I am not a guy like that so it's fine . I said just FYI it can happen to you also . He said I am willing to take that risk (basically because he thinks the risk is lower )
[11/07/19, 10:40:18 AM] Didige: And he bought up something about how women meet someone 10 times and he seems all fine then even after the girl says no , they push and that's how it happens . Are you will to take that risk ?
[11/07/19, 10:40:30 AM] Didige: And then he got angry and said he'll tell my mom -_-
[11/07/19, 10:40:55 AM] Didige: I said don't fucking tell mom . He said I won't just leave now there are guests right now
[11/07/19, 10:41:05 AM] Didige: Read in your own time
[11/07/19, 11:09:12 AM] Didige: First of all you don't know the entire journey of my PTSD in the last two years . We never talked about it . It took me a lot to open up to you about it . By saying I'm stupid you almost make it sound like I am inviting this and that it's my fault . So was the first time my fault too because I was drunk?


Secondly saying I will tell mom is the harshest thing you could ever have said . I understand this is all coming from a place of protection but telling on me isn't a route to fix it . You are 30 and I am almost 28 . We are not 12 and 14 . I intend to tell mom someday but that is my own struggle and I have been thinking about it for a long time btw . 

We could've discussed this . You could've asked me to show profiles , to give you status of exactly where I am all the time , to ask what my therapist thinks about this , had conversation with me about how other women work it out bumble  . It's a conversation I've been having with a lot of women already and have come to this step . 




This is you asking me not to go to a bar because it happened at a bar . I have had a case of verbal harassment and another man who just encroached my space at a house party. Nothing physical happened but both were situations where I questioned my safety. So it's never ever safe for us rohit . This is basically you saying don't go to work , it's not safe out there.
[11/07/19, 11:09:27 AM] Didige: I sent this to Him .
[11/07/19, 12:39:59 PM] Sush: Hi babe
[11/07/19, 12:40:14 PM] Sush: So sorry,  been in meetings continuously
[11/07/19, 12:41:31 PM] Sush: I'm glad you explained that to him
[11/07/19, 12:42:17 PM] Sush: You're absolutely right that it is *never* safe foru s
[11/07/19, 12:42:19 PM] Sush: *for us
[11/07/19, 12:42:55 PM] Sush: this can happen after you get married also
[11/07/19, 12:43:24 PM] Sush: going on different types of dates / not going on dates in  no way protects you from this
[11/07/19, 12:48:41 PM] Didige: Hau I  said that also . Sir hasn't replied 🙄
[11/07/19, 12:48:52 PM] Didige: That's whattt
[11/07/19, 12:49:05 PM] Didige: No no I hear you
[11/07/19, 12:49:15 PM] Didige: I am doing a voice call on bumble with one fellow
[11/07/19, 12:49:24 PM] Didige: Is that okay?
[11/07/19, 12:49:29 PM] Sush: look them on social media
[11/07/19, 12:49:32 PM] Sush: *them up
[11/07/19, 12:49:38 PM] Didige: No last names
[11/07/19, 12:49:44 PM] Sush: i usually do that to make sure it's a real person

[11/07/19, 1:30:04 PM] Sush: the bus thing freaked me out a bit
[11/07/19, 1:30:12 PM] Sush: ive usually never had an incident on the bus
[11/07/19, 1:30:16 PM] Sush: train pe it's common
[11/07/19, 1:30:18 PM] Didige: 🙈 I am so sorry
[11/07/19, 1:30:26 PM] Didige: How are you feeling now
[11/07/19, 1:30:38 PM] Sush: i felt unsafe on the bus for sure
[11/07/19, 1:30:44 PM] Sush: and it was harassment PLUS body shaming
[11/07/19, 1:31:04 PM] Sush: i'm just sitting and listening to my podcast and this man keeps staring
[11/07/19, 1:31:13 PM] Sush: there are some 20 seats empty and he comes and sits next to me
[11/07/19, 1:31:24 PM] Sush: i ignore, he moves to the next seat after a couple of minutes
[11/07/19, 1:31:30 PM] Sush: and then he goes do you work out?
[11/07/19, 1:31:54 PM] Sush: and he's a big, strong man and there's not too many people around so i didnt want to be confrontational
[11/07/19, 1:31:58 PM] Sush: i just said no
[11/07/19, 1:32:13 PM] Sush: he was like oh your knees are popping
[11/07/19, 1:32:30 PM] Sush: and you know i'm kinda self-conscious about my knees
[11/07/19, 1:32:37 PM] Sush: i ignored and turned away
[11/07/19, 1:32:44 PM] Sush: then he comes and stands in front of me, i ignore

[25/07/19, 2:09:38 PM] Sush: Sis why
[25/07/19, 2:09:43 PM] Sush: I’ve not even met her
[25/07/19, 2:11:01 PM] Didige: Idk I just get feeling . And like everytime an important person doesn't like the sound of a new friend I tend to hide the friendship and then it blows up like a Latha
[25/07/19, 2:11:42 PM] Didige: So I am weary because I am older mostly to tell you . If you don't like it's fine . You don't have to love all my friends
[25/07/19, 2:12:10 PM] Sush: Nooo don’t do that you know I’m just fucking with you about ‘new best friend’ - I’m actually so happy you’re making new relationships in Hyd where you can talk about stuff
[25/07/19, 2:12:25 PM] Didige: But if you feel like they will bring me down then yes I will listen to you
[25/07/19, 2:12:57 PM] Sush: I don’t know anything to like or dislike at all! I didn’t even make the connection wth the Facebook conversation until last week
[25/07/19, 2:13:14 PM] Sush: And that’s a disagreement of opinion I can have with anyone I love
[25/07/19, 2:13:53 PM] Sush: I will make sure I express this better!
[25/07/19, 2:13:54 PM] Didige: No I am not talking about that ! This has been on my head for a while now
[25/07/19, 2:14:44 PM] Didige: And she was annoying me last week and I wanted to tell you but I was like she'll say ya sure new bae . So I didn't and I don't want to do that
[25/07/19, 2:15:05 PM] Sush: Noo I wouldn’t do that in serious context!
[25/07/19, 2:15:22 PM] Sush: I’ll only pull that shit when I’m missing you and fucking around
[25/07/19, 2:15:30 PM] Didige: Yesterday I went on a bumble date and told her and was supposed to meet gaddam but I don't trust gaddam fully I think in that area so I just ended up meeting Pranati
[25/07/19, 2:15:41 PM] Didige: And I was like why I did lyk diz
[25/07/19, 2:16:09 PM] Didige: No it wasn't serious. She was just irritating me when I was trying to ghost from WhatsApp and life in blore
[25/07/19, 2:16:30 PM] Didige: And like she was telling me about technology and how I need a good smart phone
[25/07/19, 2:16:36 PM] Didige: I was like fuck off bitch
[25/07/19, 2:17:06 PM] Sush: Serious means I’d never be like ya she sucks if you had a conflict - I’d treat it from your vantage point
[25/07/19, 2:17:10 PM] Didige: I also miss you always ! But you're there and I am here means
[25/07/19, 2:18:48 PM] Sush: Means I’m saying when I say new bff it is an expression of me missing you - it has nothing to do with her at all 💞
[25/07/19, 2:19:15 PM] Sush: Lol this is like my dad
[25/07/19, 2:19:39 PM] Didige: I am getting little close to her and I am like why this sush doesn't like. And after a series of Babbu ruby ramnath Latha I am weary if my friends don't like her or something
[25/07/19, 2:19:52 PM] Sush: ‘PHONE IS AN EMERGENCY DEVICE IT MUST ALWAYS BE ACCESSIBLE’ Means correct but also 🙄
[25/07/19, 2:20:12 PM] Didige: I know but you also don't hear stories after
[25/07/19, 2:20:18 PM] Didige: TOTES

[31/07/19, 12:07:27 PM] Sush: it's like - the grant requires us to write *annual* reports
[31/07/19, 12:07:42 PM] Sush: she wants to 'update' *every month*

[02/08/19, 6:30:50 PM] Didige: My brother thinks I am a stupid twat
[02/08/19, 6:30:56 PM] Sush: Not fix him - fix your equation
[02/08/19, 6:31:05 PM] Didige: Who went and got herself raped
[02/08/19, 6:31:14 PM] Didige: It's all my fault
[02/08/19, 6:31:29 PM] Sush: He doesn’t think that, he’s scared for you
[02/08/19, 6:32:26 PM] Didige: I am twat that wore a deep v white neck and seduced a boy
[02/08/19, 6:32:31 PM] Didige: I am twat

[02/08/19, 6:33:01 PM] Didige: What ever
[02/08/19, 6:33:10 PM] Didige: No point crying about it
[02/08/19, 6:33:13 PM] Didige: What's up
[02/08/19, 6:33:47 PM] Sush: babe, what if it had been me? what would you have said about me? I have done the exact same thing you did - the only difference was that I didn’t happen to meet a predator
[02/08/19, 6:34:10 PM] Sush: and that’s just chance
[02/08/19, 6:34:13 PM] Sush: It’s random chance
[02/08/19, 6:34:23 PM] Didige: EXACTLY WHY WON'TY BROTHER UNDERSTAND THAT
[02/08/19, 6:34:30 PM] Didige: Why am I the stupid bitch
[02/08/19, 6:35:03 PM] Didige: He threaten to tell my mother!!!!!!
[02/08/19, 6:35:09 PM] Didige: How
[02/08/19, 6:35:11 PM] Didige: Please
[02/08/19, 6:35:23 PM] Didige: Explain how I deal with that
[02/08/19, 6:35:26 PM] Didige: Listen
[02/08/19, 6:35:32 PM] Didige: Forget it
[02/08/19, 6:35:39 PM] Didige: It was 2 years ago
[02/08/19, 6:35:40 PM] Sush: and I’m 100% sure women have met him in the same circumstances - it could have gone differently for them had they met someone else
[02/08/19, 6:35:48 PM] Sush: That was totally out of line to say
[02/08/19, 6:35:53 PM] Sush: It is unthinking talk
[02/08/19, 6:37:29 PM] Sush: That is textbook Rohit saying stuff without thinking
[02/08/19, 6:37:44 PM] Sush: He probably already regrets having said that
[02/08/19, 6:40:09 PM] Sush: Sis
[02/08/19, 6:40:51 PM] Didige: 1 sec
[02/08/19, 6:41:54 PM] Sush: Ok
[02/08/19, 6:42:44 PM] Didige: Sorry
[02/08/19, 6:42:57 PM] Didige: I had to call Alex and tell him I am home
[02/08/19, 6:43:00 PM] Didige: Which
[02/08/19, 6:43:02 PM] Didige: I am
[02/08/19, 6:43:03 PM] Didige: Hehe
[02/08/19, 6:43:08 PM] Sush: Ok good
[02/08/19, 6:43:25 PM] Didige: He doesn't
[02/08/19, 6:43:55 PM] Didige: He thinks it's okay for him to take that risk and I am a stupid bitch to take that risk
[02/08/19, 6:44:04 PM] Didige: Like literally this is what he said
[02/08/19, 6:44:21 PM] Sush: No I’m saying women who meet him ARE taking the same risk as you or me
[02/08/19, 6:44:24 PM] Didige: You're stupid to even go down that path after what happened to you
[02/08/19, 6:44:50 PM] Didige: Ya apparently because he is an angel
[02/08/19, 6:44:55 PM] Didige: They aren't
[02/08/19, 6:45:02 PM] Didige: Means kya bro
[02/08/19, 6:45:10 PM] Sush: Double standards maxxx
[02/08/19, 6:45:14 PM] Didige: Clear double standard
[02/08/19, 6:45:17 PM] Didige: Off course
[02/08/19, 6:45:23 PM] Didige: But he won't talk to me
[02/08/19, 6:45:36 PM] Didige: Because he thinks what he said was right
[02/08/19, 6:45:43 PM] Didige: And I don't know
[02/08/19, 6:46:01 PM] Didige: How to fight threatening to tell my mother
[02/08/19, 6:46:15 PM] Didige: Considering I've been meaning to tell her
[02/08/19, 6:46:20 PM] Didige: Since I came back
[02/08/19, 6:46:22 PM] Didige: Listen
[02/08/19, 6:46:24 PM] Didige: Really
[02/08/19, 6:46:28 PM] Sush: Say
[02/08/19, 6:46:36 PM] Didige: This is useless
[02/08/19, 6:46:37 PM] Didige: Ssup
[02/08/19, 6:46:42 PM] Didige: Whatchu doing
[02/08/19, 6:47:09 PM] Sush: It is useless for you to divert away from something that’s bothering you sis
[02/08/19, 6:47:49 PM] Sush: And your business is my business
[02/08/19, 6:48:19 PM] Sush: He won’t tell
[02/08/19, 6:48:25 PM] Sush: Highly unlikely I think
[02/08/19, 6:48:41 PM] Sush: Also take lite on telling him if you’re going on a date
[02/08/19, 6:49:00 PM] Didige: Ya correct
[02/08/19, 6:49:01 PM] Sush: Clearly he is not willing to re-examine his biases on the subject
[02/08/19, 6:49:19 PM] Didige: He won't
[02/08/19, 6:49:23 PM] Didige: Tell my mother
[02/08/19, 6:49:37 PM] Didige: But as if she's not doubting it
[02/08/19, 6:49:44 PM] Didige: You know my mother
[02/08/19, 6:49:57 PM] Didige: He told her about babbu
[02/08/19, 6:50:01 PM] Sush: Dude actually that might even work 😂
[02/08/19, 6:50:11 PM] Didige: He told her about ramnath
[02/08/19, 6:50:17 PM] Sush: What??
[02/08/19, 6:50:22 PM] Didige: Ya
[02/08/19, 6:50:26 PM] Sush: When
[02/08/19, 6:50:29 PM] Sush: What
[02/08/19, 6:50:30 PM] Didige: How do you not know this
[02/08/19, 6:50:41 PM] Sush: How do I not know this
[02/08/19, 6:50:43 PM] Didige: My mom knows
[02/08/19, 6:50:52 PM] Didige: About Varun Venugopal also!!
[02/08/19, 6:50:59 PM] Sush: What?!
[02/08/19, 6:51:06 PM] Sush: I don’t know any of this!
[02/08/19, 6:52:10 PM] Didige: So Rohit thinks he's really cool and tell his mother about anyone slightly important he's met that he is thinking about marriage
[02/08/19, 6:52:28 PM] Didige: Like literally I spell marriaze
[02/08/19, 6:52:36 PM] Didige: When I say that
[02/08/19, 6:53:20 PM] Didige: So he went on tell her about babbu when I was still whining about him , in idk life? I don't when he did but he did
[02/08/19, 6:53:42 PM] Didige: You know my family's extra way of hiding like NOTHING happened
[02/08/19, 6:53:49 PM] Sush: Omggg why is he so mamma’s boy
[02/08/19, 6:53:51 PM] Didige: So she went on to hide that
[02/08/19, 6:53:55 PM] Sush: 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️
[02/08/19, 6:53:57 PM] Didige: 😡🤬
[02/08/19, 6:54:01 PM] Didige: Please
[02/08/19, 6:54:06 PM] Didige: Don't get me started
[02/08/19, 6:54:28 PM] Didige: So in that process he told about Varun while I was dating him
[02/08/19, 6:54:31 PM] Didige: Whatever
[02/08/19, 6:54:45 PM] Sush: Godddd
[02/08/19, 6:54:47 PM] Didige: So how do I explain to my dearest mother
[02/08/19, 6:54:52 PM] Sush: That’s very annoying
[02/08/19, 6:54:53 PM] Didige: That I got raped
[02/08/19, 6:55:04 PM] Didige: Over a tinder date
[02/08/19, 6:55:08 PM] Didige: While her son
[02/08/19, 6:55:25 PM] Didige: Has been going around town
[02/08/19, 6:55:33 PM] Didige: And let me idk
[02/08/19, 6:55:42 PM] Didige: My mother is also one more
[02/08/19, 6:55:46 PM] Didige: EH
[02/08/19, 6:55:49 PM] Sush: You know what wait to tell your mom until you’re not living at home
[02/08/19, 6:55:58 PM] Didige: Sush
[02/08/19, 6:56:10 PM] Didige: I am going to live at home
[02/08/19, 6:56:17 PM] Didige: For the next 5 years
[02/08/19, 6:56:28 PM] Sush: If you get married you won’t no
[02/08/19, 6:56:46 PM] Sush: Because every time you leave the house will become one friction no
[02/08/19, 6:56:47 PM] Didige: And I've been meaning to tell my mom because arranged marriage proposals
[02/08/19, 6:57:17 PM] Didige: And if boy says no I can't marry you cause sis you were raped
[02/08/19, 6:57:25 PM] Didige: Which btw is very possible
[02/08/19, 6:57:35 PM] Didige: What should I tell my mother
[02/08/19, 6:57:38 PM] Didige: Oh maa
[02/08/19, 6:58:09 PM] Didige: I don't want to marry that boy because he's not okay that I was raped
[02/08/19, 6:58:14 PM] Didige: Oh btw haha
[02/08/19, 6:58:18 PM] Didige: I was raped
[02/08/19, 6:58:28 PM] Didige: I can't tell my mother then
[02/08/19, 6:58:40 PM] Didige: Thats not how she'd like to find out
[02/08/19, 6:58:55 PM] Didige: I have to tell her but
[02/08/19, 6:58:57 PM] Didige: So ya
[02/08/19, 6:59:32 PM] Sush: I hear you
[02/08/19, 6:59:35 PM] Didige: Ta
[02/08/19, 6:59:37 PM] Didige: Ya
[02/08/19, 6:59:39 PM] Didige: So
[02/08/19, 6:59:50 PM] Sush: There’s also people who will say I can’t marry you because you’ve had sex
[02/08/19, 6:59:55 PM] Sush: Consensual or otherwise
[02/08/19, 7:00:02 PM] Didige: Listen
[02/08/19, 7:00:29 PM] Sush: If people do that thank fucking god for telling us upfront I shouldn’t waste time on you
[02/08/19, 7:00:49 PM] Sush: I hear your concern
[02/08/19, 7:00:50 PM] Didige: These arranged marriage gulti ass proposals will be okay with me having sex
[02/08/19, 7:00:53 PM] Didige: But raped
[02/08/19, 7:00:57 PM] Didige: Uh uhhhh
[02/08/19, 7:01:04 PM] Didige: They don't want to deal with
[02/08/19, 7:01:16 PM] Didige: It's like Ashwath rw
[02/08/19, 7:01:20 PM] Didige: Simple
[02/08/19, 7:01:29 PM] Sush: I agree - but chances are very very low that a man you will want to be with otherwise will feel this way
[02/08/19, 7:01:40 PM] Didige: Ya
[02/08/19, 7:01:49 PM] Sush: Because this attitude *will* manifest in other ways
[02/08/19, 7:01:52 PM] Didige: But  what should I tell my mother
[02/08/19, 7:02:02 PM] Didige: Why I don't want a man like that
[02/08/19, 7:02:08 PM] Didige: There's a neighbour
[02/08/19, 7:02:27 PM] Didige: He's divorced because apparently his wife was bat shit crazy
[02/08/19, 7:02:33 PM] Didige: And I said hmmmmm for that
[02/08/19, 7:03:00 PM] Didige: Because in my fucking head I was like ya sure who's gonna marry a raped girl
[02/08/19, 7:03:07 PM] Didige: Because let's get real
[02/08/19, 7:03:17 PM] Didige: That's the fucking ground reality
[02/08/19, 7:03:28 PM] Didige: Rohit was like ya he's decent
[02/08/19, 7:03:36 PM] Didige: Let them talk
[02/08/19, 7:03:52 PM] Didige: Chukanna was the uncle about it
[02/08/19, 7:04:05 PM] Didige: And somehow that fucking salvaged the situation
[02/08/19, 7:04:06 PM] Sush: I hear you but it’s defs going to reveal itself in many other ways
[02/08/19, 7:04:25 PM] Didige: He was like wtf why does she have to meet divorced men .
[02/08/19, 7:04:45 PM] Didige: And that says nothing about that man . Honestly he sounded fantastic
[02/08/19, 7:04:57 PM] Didige: And I really am open to meet him
[02/08/19, 7:05:17 PM] Didige: But I don't want to meet him when my own brother thinks this
[02/08/19, 7:05:21 PM] Didige: What bro
[02/08/19, 7:05:56 PM] Didige: I JUST WANT TO TELL MY MOTHER
[02/08/19, 7:06:02 PM] Didige: And I don't know how
[02/08/19, 7:06:14 PM] Didige: She still think Rohit is an angel
[02/08/19, 7:06:27 PM] Didige: LIKE MAYBE I AM A MONSTER
[02/08/19, 7:06:32 PM] Didige: I am bro
[02/08/19, 7:06:34 PM] Didige: I am
[02/08/19, 7:07:13 PM] Sush: Have you talked to varudhini about how to tell your mom? It’ll be a good thing to get her ideas on no? Like how to bring it up
[02/08/19, 7:07:27 PM] Sush: You’re not a monster, stop using this language
[02/08/19, 7:08:40 PM] Didige: Yeah and she was clearly like it's a big step . When you decide to we'll talk . But you need to decide to . I asked her if I can bring my mother for therapy or Rohit for therapy and she said yes bit time to both
[02/08/19, 7:08:53 PM] Didige: But what should I tell my mother
[02/08/19, 7:09:28 PM] Didige: I told her I've been going to therapist for my anger issues and she still says I am an angry little twat
[02/08/19, 7:09:32 PM] Didige: And Rohit
[02/08/19, 7:09:39 PM] Didige: Well he won't co-operate
[02/08/19, 7:10:14 PM] Didige: No re maybe I am. Must be no my whole family is consistently laughing at my anger issues
[02/08/19, 7:10:23 PM] Didige: I must be a twat
[02/08/19, 7:10:27 PM] Didige: Chi
[02/08/19, 7:10:50 PM] Sush: No, you’re not. You’re having a difficult phase - you’re working through it.
[02/08/19, 7:11:09 PM] Sush: I’m quite confident your mom will come to therapy with you if you ask no?
[02/08/19, 7:11:39 PM] Sush: Especially if you tell her you have something that’s bogging you down a lot and you want to tell her about it but aren’t sure how
[02/08/19, 7:12:02 PM] Sush: She’s a woman re, at the end of the day, she will understand
[02/08/19, 7:14:02 PM] Didige: She's gone to therapy herself
[02/08/19, 7:14:13 PM] Didige: When I was 2
[02/08/19, 7:14:32 PM] Sush: Oh! Then she will be even more open to it no?
[02/08/19, 7:14:33 PM] Didige: So she's doesn't think therapy is for mad people or something
[02/08/19, 7:14:49 PM] Sush: Ya your mom is too practical to think that also
[02/08/19, 7:15:14 PM] Didige: But shes not understanding of why I am even going
[02/08/19, 7:15:26 PM] Didige: And I don't how to tell her
[02/08/19, 7:16:00 PM] Didige: And she's been going mad that none of her kids are married or settled
[02/08/19, 7:16:15 PM] Didige: So we have failed her
[02/08/19, 7:16:23 PM] Didige: Well at least I did
[02/08/19, 7:16:28 PM] Sush: Should we figure out a way to tell her without details? Means as much detail as you’re comfortable with
[02/08/19, 7:16:47 PM] Sush: You worry about marriage after chukkanna is married
[02/08/19, 7:17:08 PM] Didige: HOW
[02/08/19, 7:17:52 PM] Didige: See fortunately my mother doesn't think marriage is equivalent to being settled okay
[02/08/19, 7:18:23 PM] Didige: But I am not going to deny the kind of pressure my family puts on her
[02/08/19, 7:18:42 PM] Didige: There's a lot of shot that went down with her own mother
[02/08/19, 7:18:44 PM] Sush: Yeah it must be exhausting for her
[02/08/19, 7:18:57 PM] Didige: And she doesn't want to repeat those mistakes
[02/08/19, 7:19:03 PM] Sush: Oh okay
[02/08/19, 7:19:03 PM] Didige: But it is exhausting
[02/08/19, 7:19:08 PM] Sush: Yeah it is
[02/08/19, 7:19:12 PM] Sush: I can imagine
[02/08/19, 7:19:54 PM] Didige: Ya my grandmother took birth control and that's why my mother was born a deformed baby
[02/08/19, 7:20:55 PM] Didige: My father cheated on her after all 3 of us were born and she quit her job
[02/08/19, 7:21:29 PM] Didige: Please don't think any less of my father. I found out about this when I was 21
[02/08/19, 7:21:48 PM] Didige: This is when she went to therapy
[02/08/19, 7:21:52 PM] Sush: That’s a lot for her - must have been so overwhelming with three kids
[02/08/19, 7:22:14 PM] Didige: Yes and she chose to stay and fight with my father
[02/08/19, 7:22:31 PM] Sush: No of course not, we’ve clearly seen over and over again that good people make mistakes (including us)
[02/08/19, 7:23:19 PM] Didige: It's the only reason my dad never join politics . My grandfather was an independent mla . I don't know if you know all this.
[02/08/19, 7:23:46 PM] Didige: But my father wanted to and my mother put her foot down and said over my fucking dead body
[02/08/19, 7:23:49 PM] Sush: I knew your grandfather was involved in politics, didn’t know the details
[02/08/19, 7:23:59 PM] Sush: Ohhh
[02/08/19, 7:24:10 PM] Didige: Ya I know . I never told you this that's why
[02/08/19, 7:24:27 PM] Didige: Films and politics were my father's two interests
[02/08/19, 7:24:35 PM] Didige: He invests in 2 films
[02/08/19, 7:24:42 PM] Didige: Got cheated
[02/08/19, 7:24:54 PM] Didige: Which is why I still get resistance
[02/08/19, 7:25:04 PM] Sush: Ohhh that makes more sense now
[02/08/19, 7:25:04 PM] Didige: So ya
[02/08/19, 7:25:11 PM] Didige: Ya
[02/08/19, 7:25:25 PM] Didige: I don't know why I didn't tell you this before
[02/08/19, 7:25:48 PM] Sush: Yeah, you’ve never talked about it!
[02/08/19, 7:26:02 PM] Didige: Yaaaa
[02/08/19, 7:26:09 PM] Didige: Like that
[02/08/19, 7:26:56 PM] Sush: Also uncle’s General interest in politics is in new light now
[02/08/19, 7:27:10 PM] Sush: I hadn’t connected the history
[02/08/19, 7:27:36 PM] Sush: I know he loves talking politics with gaddam no
[02/08/19, 7:29:06 PM] Didige: Listen fuck gaddam
[02/08/19, 7:29:12 PM] Didige: She's the real twat
[02/08/19, 7:29:22 PM] Sush: Ok sorry 😅
[02/08/19, 7:29:31 PM] Didige: But no my dad's wanted to join politics
[02/08/19, 7:29:34 PM] Didige: Still does

[02/08/19, 7:33:41 PM] Sush: But it’ll help you figure out what you want to say
[02/08/19, 7:33:49 PM] Didige: Hmmm

[02/08/19, 7:40:13 PM] Didige: But my father wouldn't have achieved quarter of the shit he did if she didn't help him
